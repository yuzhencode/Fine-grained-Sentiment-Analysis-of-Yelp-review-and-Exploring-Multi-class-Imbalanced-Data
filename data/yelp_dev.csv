0,"Entirely too expensive. Especially because my pink and white gel set cost me $100 and it had to be her first time doing it, because it was horrible. There is no distinguished line where the white stops and the pink begins. It just looks messy. I won't be going back."
4,Visited Charro at the suggestion of my six year old niece and she was right...this is a great Mexican restaurant. Cheese dip was excellent as were their chips. I had tilapia dinner with a side of beans which were all cooked and seasoned to perfection. Service was great as were the prices. Nice place in the corner of a strip mall.
4,These are the best sandwiches in town. They now have two locations. I would be honored to be the spokesperson. Love this place.
2,"Decent spot to see a movie. Not the newest or cleanest I have been in but good. 3D options are nice and the DBox is cool. 

Pro Tip: Come on Tuesdays for discounts on movies, food and drinks."
4,"The most fun I've had in one afternoon!! Tammy is the most knowledgeable person to get information about the ""Toys"" she sells. She makes learning exciting and is very helpful if you have specific issues you might need help with. Go visit Tammy and staff for an amazing experience!!"
4,"Location is awesome, 1 mike away from Cachuma lake. Food, great portions and the taste is best!!"
0,"Don't shop here, plenty of other places yo buy yarn. My car was broken into, the thieves took my little black book of receipts and ""frequent flyer/loyalty cards"". I asked Criativity to restore my card points. They recused yo do so even with proof of purchase. Never again."
4,great food and fast!!!!! bartender who took my to go order was friendly and prompt!!!!!!!!!!!
4,"What great service! ..and great plant choices obviously.

I went in with a container and left with a beautiful succulent arrangement! The staff made me pick my succulents, color combo of rocks and sand and explained how she was layering everything so I could do this again by myself. It was like a mini class. It took her about twenty minutes and answered all my questions. The arrangement ended up costing around $40. 

There's more than just plants and flowers as well. I'll be going here for my other greenery needs!"
0,"Put together slop , don't have meatballs one time pork was of the worst my friend had and he's a big guy he don't waste food . This sandwich went into thrash !!! 
Well any way I settled for a filet cheesesteak honestly ill never get it again its def not a cheesesteak not even close ... 
Anyway 1 choice of drink diet coke what the hell I weight 170lbs I'm on no diet and I hate the taste of it ! Thumbs down ... Won't see me again !cua later"
3,"I just love this place!  One of my favorite in town.  I always love how welcome the staff make you feel when you walk thru the door. 
It's always nice and clean generally pretty packed....all things I like to see.  I have never had a bad experience here have probably eaten here 10 plus times. 
The food is always nice and fresh is always presented well. This little sushi joint is a well kept secret....if more people realized how amazing this place is no one would ever get in!!!!"
0,Food was cold. Cold buffet food is where serious food borne illness breeds. Two bites and I happily paid to leave with whatever is left of my health.
3,"DELICIOUS and interesting taste combinations! The owner and her staff were lovely, too. My only criticism is the lack of a non-sandwich option--or even a reduced-bread option. I'd LOVE to get a bowl of (or a salad with) the sandwich contents or order a sandwich in a flatbread or tortilla option. The baguette-style sandwich bread used was a little too much bread for me. Regardless, I'll be back!"
2,"The food was good, the restaurant was completely empty on a Saturday evening but it is in a location opposite of downtown St Pete. The gumbo was delicious but the Jambalaya was either beans on rice with sausage on top or some type of dirty rice. Either way it's supposed to be more of a thick stew with rice. Kind of disappointing since creole food is supposed to be spiced flavorful comfort food! Also, they only serve beneits on Sunday's for brunch :( I really wanted to try theirs."
4,"Amazing mousse cakes with the perfect balance of flavors.  Their menu has an overwhelming selection matcha green tea flavors. Being a chocoholic, I simply loved the triple chocolate mousse cake the most. Perfect place for late night dessert cravings."
4,"I have come to love this place. The coffee is not that great, the place is a dive but the location is exceptional for people watching and getting to know new friends. I have met so many people from this place its like a old neighborhood haunt that folks are attracted to but they cant tell you why. Ali the proprietor does serve some great Persian dishes that are enjoyed by omnivores and vegetarians alike. During Ramadan the neighborhood gets together for free meals every night of the season, each one different and wonderful. I love this place, its bike friendly and Chris approved."
4,"I would definitely recommend this Midas. 
The service was great. 

My work van needed tires.   They had the specific tires in stock and me back on the road  so I could continue working.  
I am very impressed with the experience and will be using them to repair some other parts on the vehicle ..."
3,"I come here about every 2 weeks. Their prices are great and manis and pedis are consistent. The people are friendly, love that!"
4,We have come here for years... the drinks are great and the memories will last for ever!!!  Rey to sit next to a flaming fountain if you can!
1,"I usually don't have any issues with Westshore. However, I ordered an anti-pasta salad and they delivered it rotten. I called back and an hour later they showed up again with a more than wilted salad. The woman I spoke to on the phone said they made their salads day. The salad they delivered was reprehensible. I've ordered from here for years with no issues but I will never order from there again after that incident."
4,"Chris Murphy is an excellent sales rep. Helped us find exactly what we needed, and explained our options for the furniture AND the specifics on the delivery, Goof Proof & charges for both. 

He gave us space to discuss, but he was available for any and all questions. He never tried to ""sell"" us on anything and was very open on pricing & returns and such. 

We would highly recommend him and the Bobs at Northwest Plaza in Bridgeton, MO."
0,I'm surprised this is one of the highest rated steak houses in Tucson. The service was good but the food wasn't worth the money. Please season your meat.
4,Went in on a Saturday and they had a line of cars waiting. It took an hour for my turn; only have 2 racks. Took only 15 minutes on the rack to get me done. Good price- cash only; no credit/debit cards. Would go back to save money!
4,"I went here for the first time last month for a pretty big change in my hair style. I got a cut and color from Alexa, and she did an absolutely amazing job. I showed her a few pictures of what I wanted and after making sure she understood my vision completely, she totally delivered. She is my official go to hairstylist in Philly. It seems like a pretty busy salon so you probably need to make your appointment a few weeks ahead of time, but that just means it's a good place because it's so busy! I can't wait to go back."
4,Sold them my car and they were very quick and courteous!  I will probably go back there to purchase my next vehicle!
3,I went here after a funeral so it wasn't a happy event. The food was really good though and the staff was pleasant. I just wish it was happier circumstances.
3,"The veggie burger was just ""ok"" nothing to write home about. It was deep fried but still was a little too soft in the middle. You must get cheese on it to give it that extra taste that is missing. The fries were amazing and service was very good. 
I will return and give another chance!"
4,This little gem is worth the extra $.  The bread is flown in from Las Vegas... it is so delicious! I love the cappestrami sandwich.  Pastrami and coleslaw is magical.  My favorite place to treat myself or my teenage sons!
3,"I ordered Mysore Masala Dosa. I loved it. My friend ordered egg Dosa, egg puff and chicken 555. Loved everything. The 555 was more like 65. I'll definitely come here again. Maybe become a regular even. Oh, I gave 4stars because the service was slow and I waited 10 minutes to find a place to sit."
0,"Cute restaurant, staff was courteous but the food is not authentic. Won't be back again. Small portions for the price, chicken was undercooked pernil ( roast pork) had little to no flavor and the mofongo unexpectedly had bacon in it. Visited on a Sunday afternoon and they were out of so many items that I finally asked the server just to tell what she didn't have (on a small menu) so we could choose from what was available. Oh well we tried it once"
4,"Caveat Emptor - Call before you go. Last time I went by there was a sign out front that the store was closed due to a family emergency. NOTE - Family emergency has been attended to and Bagel Bistro is now open. With bagels as good as any I've had in New York, and better than any I've had outside of New York."
3,"It is National Oyster day!! Where better to enjoy than at ""Oyster Bar"" in Downtown St. Petersburg!!

Easy in, get seated, grab a drink and some delicious appetizers and enjoy the game. 

Staff is super friendly and is super comfy atmosphere. Drink and food specials, including the Oyster shooter (see picture) for ONLY a BUCK!!! Yeehaw."
4,Nice little hidden gem in the area.  Quality every time.  They do a good cuban in three different sizes.
1,My mom let me rate 7 yogurt shops as a summer project. This shop is called love it but I did not love it. The employee was on her cell phone when I was waiting for service. I did not think that was good. I did not think the yogurt tasted the best. One flavor I got I even had to throw in the trash. The chocolate had a weird taste. I would not go back to this yogurt shop.
2,"Quintessential dive bar. Filled with smoke, cheap beer, and neighborhood regulars. The pizza was alright -- cardboard crust and provel cheese....but nothing special even for STL pizza. Jukebox available. 

Pros: cheap beer, dive bar
Cons: dive bar"
3,Very good bacon egg and cheese bagel. Bagel toasted just right and eggs were were light and not overly greasy. Sign said sandwiches include coffee but mine was not. Won't hold it against them because the bagel was worth he extra 1.99. I will definitely stop back when in the area.
0,Brought a small simple dress to dry clean cost $11+. All the yellow sweat marks are still there after the clean. A completely waste of money!
4,"Great place if you don't want to rub elbows with kiddies or douchebags.
It's a fun, very chill place."
3,"This restaurant was great! We enjoyed a wonderful dinner complete with, gnocchi, meatballs, and brussel sprouts. Each dish had a unique flavor. The service did not disappoint. I also ordered the California Pinot Noir. It was delicious but slightly overpriced. 

As for our appetizer, we ordered the smoked trout. Don't. Do. It. Very disappointed. It was overly fishy and the house potatoes chips were too salty."
2,"The space is beautiful and everything is new and clean which is what initially drew me here. However, my nail tech absolutely murdered my nails by heavily filing the entire surface of the nail so much that you could completely see through them and bend them over like paper. They were long and sturdy when I came in and I'm definitely going to be paying for this visit for months with weak nails."
0,"Do not stay here. Poorly ran. 
Stains on the bedding. Roaches in the towels (not kidding). Dirty. Smelled horrible (desk clerk offered to spray orange scent in our room). Previous room guest belongings were left in room."
0,"very nasty,rude and unprofessional store!!!!!!!!!!!
john hung up on me! over priced for junk frames! they told me they was out of network with my insurance,over charged me and later i find out they was in network! they promised to put in insurance claim so i can get reinbursed and after two months nothing was done! this business needs to be shut down!!! 

save yourself of the stress and drama and go else where!!!
poor customer service!!!"
4,"I'd been to basically every store in philadelphia looking for a pair of glasses (at least a dozen stores) but each store had the same 20 pairs of frames, none of which looked good on me. Lynchwood was the only one that had different frames to try and I found a pair of frames I LOVE for WAY cheaper than I would pay anywhere else. I think it was less than half the price of anywhere else I had looked. The staff was wonderful and helpful and they have an awesome eye for good frames. I can't wait to order from them again when quarantine is over."
4,"Great weekend breakfast spot. I've probably eaten here 4-5 times and each time come away very very satisfied and disappointed that I did not leave enough room for desert. 

I have not hesitated to take visiting family and friends to the Cafe."
3,Some of the best steaks in the Reno area. The staff was very nice and prompt. We have learned to go at their less busy times as it can get very loud when busy.
3,"Don't listen to the bad reviews full of typos & misspellings. Poor grammar = poor judge of quality. 
Excellent barbecue, service, value, decor, music and margaritas (garnished with grilled pineapple!)
Try it!!"
4,Jay at the bar is an amazing bartender.   He is very active and lively and does amazing!
4,"All of the drinks here are outstanding. Love the cold brewed Columbian blend myself. Nice indoor and outdoor seating right by the Monon in Carmel's Midtown. Easy parking in the garage. The staff members are all awesome. very friendly and helpful! They also have an app so if you need to order ahead you can, grab and go. Make sure to check place out. They also have a location in Clay Terrace and Broad Ripple."
0,Terrible service.  Girls at bar not paying any attention to you. Sat there for 10 Minutes without acknowledged
4,"My tech was prompt, efficient and made sure everything worked and looked good. I highly recommend!!"
4,"This is the best Chinese restaurant that I can find in Reno. I am a Chinese, and I can tell what is traditional Chinese food. Most of the Chinese restaurants in US are Americanized, but this one is not. I have been here many times ordering different cases, this place never disappointed me. The hot pot is great, too."
4,"Best dentist I've ever been to! Everyone at Noble Dentistry is super sweet, and they really care about the patients! Scheduling an appointment is always easy, and the reminders are very helpful. Once, I forgot all about my appointment, they called 30 minutes after it was scheudled, and held my spot during the 10 minutes it took for me to get there. On top of that, they make sure you're not in any pain and that you are comfortable. Love Noble and will continue going here for a long time!"
4,We love it here.  The food is excellent and the hospitality top notch.  Tom is a super owner/host.  We've brought everyone we know here and all have enjoyed it.  We also really enjoy the atmosphere but also do frequent take out when a night in is call for.
4,"Wowzers. This place is beyond cool and great grub. Service was awesome ... unfortunately our server is leaving and I won't put a name out there ... for now. Food was fantastic atmosphere was hip and fun. Definitely should plan on coming for a great meal and better drinks, oh and to roll thunder (bowl)."
1,It's an ok place. The lady getting your food is a bit rude  and slow.  The Breakfast sandwich are dry and tasteless.
4,A great bakery.  Tucson's lucky to have a few gems and this is certainly one.
4,There food is always perfect. We haven't been since the Covid happened. But I'd advise getting there early as possible because they fill up quick.
3,"The Happy Rooster is a great no frills spot for drinks and apps. I can't comment on dinner but every time I've been here the apps have been tasty!

All of the servers and bartenders are really nice! Deff recommend for a chill spot to grab a beer or a mixed drink."
1,"The sushi was OK. I got a Philly Roll, a Spider Roll, Unagi, and Salmon Nigiri. The avocado in the Philly Roll was turning brown and the rice was a little dried out and chewy. The Spider Roll was only 5 very thin pieces and there was very little crab in them, it was mostly breading. The Unagi and Salmon Nigiri were meh as well."
1,"Got the Taro Milk Tea and it was the worst I ever had, tasted like it was just milk. My wife had the passion fruit and it was decent. I've had bubble tea from several other places and this was the worst I've ever had."
0,"Waitress was a turd. Owner was a bigger turd. If you want to go somewhere to get poor service, average (at best) food, and a headache this is the place for you."
0,3 strikes and you're out.  They gave us the complete wrong order at pickup.  This is the second wrong order in a row and 3rd bad experience.  The other I had to wait 25 minutes last pickup time for my food. This time I called to get a complete credit as I couldn't go back to the place. I was told I would get a call back and I received nothing.  I am sure I will have to call tomorrow and chase this down.  I can't support this local place any more.
4,"Excellent service, very friendly, informative, helpful, very clean and excellent pedicure! Great selections of polish and quality. Looking forward to my next visit. Thank you!"
4,"Chicken wings, t-ravs, and thin crust pizza (like a buttery friend cracker) were seriously delicious. This was my first time in since the restaurant changed names and ownership. Wow!"
4,"Another great night at BB's.  Had a chance to sample the gumbo and the honey wings, all while listening to great blues.  This is a stop I make every time I'm in town.  It's a local treasure that I wish more locals knew about."
3,"Food is great. Chicken platter was a huge portion of 2 pcs, with 2 sides. Couldn't finish it all. Chicken skin was so crispy! And meat was moist. 

We went on a Wednesday night at 8pm and there was a huge line out the door. So we decided to order online thru their website, it was ready for us in like 30 mins. 

I'd say food would be worth the wait."
1,"Went to see Garth Brooks and the concert was great.  One of the best I've ever seen.  The stadium, however, was a big downer.  The floors were so sticky that I could not move my feet without hearing that sound of Velcro detaching.  I almost lost a shoe! Very unpleasant and got in the way of my dance moves."
1,The hostess were rude. They asked us to wait saying they did not have a table we go to the car to wait and they ended up seating to other parties until I said something. I came with my bf to eat with our daughter. The service was food but the food a was just okay. It had no favor and it felt like something anybody could have thrown together.
3,"Loved brunch here! Great service, best mimosa I had in Nashville! I ordered a special omelette that was amazing! Highly recommend it!"
3,What an outstanding St. Pete's gem! The collection is vast and the tour guides are incredibly knowledgeable and funny at this museum; if you have an hour or two this is a great place to stop in and expand your mind!
1,I ordered food from here today and the food was completely wrong. The cheese steak I order was made wrong all together. I took a hr to get to me when they are 5 minutes away from my house. I called back to have them fix it and still have not gotten back to me or delivered the food. I would not complain if I was not allergic to onions but I am.
3,"What a dive.  But with 2 for 1 on select beers and killer hurricanes, you can not go wrong here.  Oh and the live music was out of this world.  My partner and I just happened to drop in during a set of one of the local Cajun blues bands.  Man what great music.  They really rocked the house!!!  4.5 stars:-)!!"
1,"food is average. Wished they had better service. They will charge you anything extra, so always ask. i have to look for better Chinese take out."
3,Loved the chicken.  I went multiple times.  Tip.  Breasts are a bit dry.  Thighs were moist and flavorful.
4,WAY BETTER than Hattie B's. This chicken gets HOT too so keep that in mind while ordering. If you come to Nashville for hot chicken u have to try the original. Often imitated but certainly not duplicated. The sides were much more flavorful than Hattie B's also. Skip the rest and come try the creator of hot chicken
3,"There are some good stands. A couple of good vegetable stands and a great plant stand, on the northwest corner of the square. And the guacamole! Buy the guacamole, it's the best ever!!"
4,Crystal was and amazing and nice waitress definitely worth coming in and enjoying the wonderful food and service
1,"The room was very disappointing, especially for a Hilton! I expected more, I've stayed at 3star hotels that were WAYYY nicer than this! The lobby was VERY NICE even the elevator was very upscale, but as soon as we walked off the elevator to the 12th floor it looked as though we were staying in a 2star hotel!! The hallway was dirty and disgusting, The blankets and pillows have stains; We were supposed to stay in two queen beds, but they were only 2 full sized! There's just no way I'd stay here again!!"
4,"I had a great experience purchasing my new Forester from Jim at Welsh Subaru! He was very nice, and I didn't feel bullied into buying a car that day (like I had been at other dealerships) We will be back when its time for my husband to get a new car. Thanks Jim!"
4,"Small, personable shop. Excellent and friendly customer service. Fair prices. I dropped by without an appointment because my headlights had gone out on my Prius. They were busy but fortunately were able to fit me it that morning. The waiting room was comfortable and neat, the bathroom was clean and they had a nice selection of Keurig coffees. Unexpected auto costs suck but Dan's Toy Shop made the experience pleasant."
4,"What can I say! Emily took care of us.  She knew what she talked about.  Great recommendations.  Knowledgeable.  She introduced me to blind pig.  Man!  Great, clean smooth taste from Russian River.    It gives Pliny the Elder run for it's money.  Don't get me wrong... two great beers.  I just prefer blind pig now.  

Thanks, Emily.  I'll be back for more."
3,Food here fresh restaurant area is clean and staff is friendly. Love the homemade kind of food and this place does it very well
3,"Great neighborhood place to grab a quick dessert.  My go to is the American Favorite crepe or the Rocky Road crepe. 

Ask for a punchcard and bring it each time you go, I find that they don't offer to punch it unless you mention it."
4,Had such a positive experience yesterday with two employees. Young guys--very friendly and helpful.
3,Everything but the sauce is delicious. Fresh and cooked as you wait . The red sauce need help
4,"Engaging, thorough, and encouraging instructors. Welcoming staff and beautiful ""zen"" studio in a great location. Great class with Derek Hopkins!"
0,I bought a Shock Top Belgian Ale 12 pack for $25 when everywhere else is sold for $16 or less. Rip off. Won't go there again.
3,"This new Mary Brown's location just opened in the Meadows/Silverberry area. Being a Newfoundlander Mary Brown's is a staple so I had to check it out. 

This location is immaculate! Service was great from the moment I walked in and food was predictable and consistent with any MB's I've ever had. 

Not really much else to comment on... I will be back for sure!"
4,I grew up going to this restaurant and the food is still every bit as amazing as it was when I was younger. Great family restaurant with great service and great people.
0,"They treat customers as suspects instead of patrons.  Ridiculously overpriced.  Custom leather goods for outrageous prices, $75 for a drumstick holster.  $100 for a paper, fret less, non electric cigar box guitar with strings so high off the board you couldn't even play it flat.  Garbage!  
And $99 Johnson acoustic priced at $115.  No respect for this place.  A complete joke of a music store!  Avoid avoid avoid!  If you're a real musician don't waste your time or money here."
3,"Came back again, had the wings, mozzarella sticks, Ceasars salad, minestrone soup and the Carmel apple pie...omg...loved every bit...and the service by Sue was fabulous."
3,"Love takeout at No. 1. Best chicken fried rice and moo goo gai pan around.

Prices are reasonable and fast turnaround."
4,"I can't say enough about Charlotte's. I loved their huge delicious portions. I had crab imperial stuffed mushrooms to start, they were filled with lump crabmeat and Salmon with rice. It was delicious. I had enough leftover for lunch today. I am only in town for 5 days and I plan to go there again before I leave. I also loved the piano player and excellent service!"
4,Stopped in after a coworker referred me and they had amazing macaroons!!! Wanted to get a taste of Paris before our upcoming trip and this place did just that. Will definitely be stopping back in for more.
0,Not good customer service at all in the morning. Got my order wrong three times. All the girls have BRF.
4,We were riding bikes one morning and rode past Steam so we had to stop.  What a gem in St. Pete Beach.  The coffees were outstanding.  My bf had an omelet which was fresh and delicious.  I ordered the blueberry crepes.  The crepes were very thin tasty.  We will be back again.  Loved it!
4,Great service! Had a tire blown out and needed a replacement! Service was quick and cheaper than my regular auto shop! Will come back!
3,It's an unassuming sushi restaurant in the heart of Philly. The house Shiroi Hana roll was super tasty. Definitely worth coming back for more sushi.
2,"Dead turtles adrift in brandy and a fish with a curious name.
Steamy ambience, literally.  It was June..
Co-conspirator and courtyard simultaneously charming.
A gaggle of sorority girls giggled.
Stiletto spiked ankle twisted from fall
Mood ambushed.
More brandy please."
4,"I thought Indian restaurants were all similar but this place is just one level above the rest!
My favorite Indian dish is chicken tikka Masala and I think I've found the most savory flavorful tikka masala here!
I was there to celebrate my friends lunch on a weekend and we were there before the lunch peak time... and we got very good service!
I loved their lentil soup as well. 
I thought the parking was a bit weird, I drove around the lot but most spaces were reserved for sunking although there were Many other businesses in this plaza."
4,"Clean, convenient location with easy entrances and exits.  Stopped in for some gas on our way to pick up my daughter's friend for a sleepover.  This location is quite large and fairly new.  PLENTY of gas pumps available and gas was priced around the same as everywhere else.  Pump areas were clean and well maintained.  There is a car wash available as well should you want to run your car through after pumping.  You can purchase the car wash at the pump also."
4,"Excellent Cuban food with very reasonable prices. I placed a large online order here about an hour before they closed. They had it ready quickly - very easy to use. I appreciated that! Ordering a big order over the phone can be time consuming and more likely to result in miscommunication.

I also especially liked they have vegan labeling on their menu."
4,"We love this place. We make special trips (85 mile round trip) to come eat here. The menu is exquisite and the atmosphere is so fun. Peyton is the most energetic, bubbly, and friendly waitress we've ever met. This place has SPECK!  The Bourbon spice rack is orgasmic. I'm sure there may be equally nice restaurants in Nashville, but we'll never know, because we can't get over Barcelona. 
One of my favorite all time restaurants. Will keep coming here over and over again. 

  David"
2,Me and my son always go here to watch new movies however we always have to wait at least 30mins to get tickets because there's only one person at the window food is only available on the first floor but most movies are on the second floor so u miss half your movie ... There's more security then employees that's what's ridiculous.. Soooo hire more people....
4,"My boyfriend and I come here often from Ventura. Mexican food is easy to come by in CA, but not fresh, light Mexican. Cava is so great! The service is amazing! Lucy (hostess) Jaime and John (bartender)  are the best! Even if the food sucked (it soooooo doesn't) we would come back just for the service. There's a lot of variety on the menu... My personal favorite is the mole poblano top notch!!! One of montecitos finest!!! Eat here!"
3,"I can't believe it had taken me so long to try out besito! They have a great happy hour with lots of tapas and margarita options. I particularly loved their enchiladas, tableside guacamole qnd tangerine margarita. I can't wait to come back and try more options."
4,"Sketchy on the outside, whole other world on the inside. The biggest ""downside"" is that there are too many delectable options to pick from. The sushi is unbelievably fresh and extremely reasonably priced. For the people who claim this place is too expensive clearly don't eat sushi that much. Highly recommend. Try parking in the train station right across the street."
3,"Outstanding food & service !  My wife was impressed.  Ravioli & salad were very good. Small, intimate setting.  Friendly servers.  Fun place."
4,I love alex's. and i love alex! he is the only person that i have been to that actually examines your hair ans sees how it flows before he cuts it. i have never had that before. I really trusted him with my hair because he gets excited when he cuts. its as if he gets as much satisfaction out of your hair looking good as you do. love him. miss him since i have left SB.
3,Service has gotten a little lazy lately but the food is still good. Braised tofu on rice is the best. Their soups are good too
2,"This is actually the place where they dropped off the first slaves. It's a few monuments that recognize that more of a placard, but right here at the crescent is where they dropped off the first slaves in 1700"
4,Just bought a bike here today and had a great experience. JOE helped me choose a bike and spent an extensive amount of time helping me test drive and answering questions. I had a great experience. I did not feel rushed and he did not try to up sell me on anything.
3,We ate inside and the atmosphere was very nice for lunch.  They had a real fireplace going.  The service was good.  The food was terrific.  I had the lobster and shrimp spring rolls and the french dip.  I would definitely go back.
0,Terrible service guy on the phone nor did the manager know there own website prices they kept trying to increase the price after saying ill take my business elsewhere they changed their tone.. Also I ordered my pizza well done it came to me late and semi raw I called and got the same attitude from the same guy and manager an hr later I finally got my second pizza which was burnt REALLY?!?! Screw it.. Never again will I order from cafe Roma on causeway again not worth the headache or or rude employees
3,"Delightful! Great little spot to grab breakfast in the neighborhood. The 'fill out your own order' slip of paper while ordering is a little odd (lazy?), but the egg and bacon sandwich I had was great!"
2,"I read the reviews before ordering and I was hesitant at first, but the food was okay. My main complaint is that the spring rolls were heavily breaded and seemed like something you would ship up yourself after buying it from the store. I would've wanted it to be a little crispier, fresher, and filled with more vegetables (it kind of just tasted like dough. The beef in the curry was different than what I was used to, but pretty good overall. It just needed more seasoning/ flavor. Not my overall favorite Thai place, but it's solid."
4,My new favorite Thai place. Large selection and I've enjoyed everything I've tried so far. Can't wait to try the pho next! Beautiful atmosphere and attentive service. Definitely recommend you try them out!
4,"I had such a wonderful dining experience here! Amazing food, friendly and attentive staff, terrific atmosphere. I am recommending this place to everyone! I will definitely be returning here regularly!"
1,"My daughter chose to have party here and so did a few thousand others the same day. Everything was 2 hr wait. 2 hr wait to bowl, 2 hr wait for dining table. We ended up shopping until the bowling was ready and bowled a game and went to eat at Chili's near food court. Never again on a weekend."
4,"I just had the most extraordinary experience with Layla's! I special ordered specific items catered for a memorial at my home. The food was exceptional. Delivery was prompt and the set up was perfect as the (space) conditions were very limited. 

Tofu was excellent, and I am a tofu skeptic! I will use Layla's whenever I can."
4,I came here with my #Squad for a girls trip. We were greeted by Nick(who's amazing) and he was so informative and sweet!! I was so excited! I've never had whiskey and walked away spending money! I totally recommend this place!
4,Had a great experience with Royal Carriages! Mark and Patsy showed us all the cool spots are the French quarter. Mark definitely knows what he's talking about and taught us a lot about the history of this beautiful city. Definitely recommend!
4,"I've Bern here a few times and can always find something I like. Whether it's a flight of beer for a variety of local tastings, something straight from the bar or noshes to absorb the alcohol; this place offers up everything with a smile."
4,It is the customer service that keeps bringing me back!  Incredibly friendly and helpful. Highly recommend!!!!
0,"Slow, even online orders aren't made on time but 20 minutes behind 
Untidy
Customer service - 0%

The GM needs to step in, support the staff and step this place up. It's not well run at all. The team needs a good motivational leader. Good help is hard to find but could probably be found with the right person/ right pay."
4,"We ordered 6 different rolls between 2 people, and almost all of it was eaten! Every roll was delicious!"
3,"Best wings around, they use Griffins hot sauce. Loved the sauce so much I looked up the company and bought a gallon of the turbo! Traditional or boneless wings equally as good. Taco salad and crab fries are also a hit with me if your not a wing person. Good beer selection and great service. Mixed drinks are a tad pricy but it's worth it for the food. 

They also have 2 pool tables and one night I went in and they had a poker night, cool!! Awesome place"
0,I order a number 15 and no they hang up this is trash and they also have Burger King foot lettuce
3,"I went here today after some of my bar patrons had talked about how good of a job they did. And in fact, they do a very good job."
1,Came for a couple drinks and appetizers after a Predators game.  My boyfriend ordered the beer flight and I had a whisky.  Drinks were great but the food not so much.  We ordered the Jalepeno Cheese Dip and was underwhelmed.  The atmosphere was pretty cool we sat upstairs along the bar.   Would probably come give these guys another shot but not expecting too much.
4,"Highly recommend Sneha's! Everyone is very friendly, and are meticulous and eager to please. Very reasonable prices, and very clean shop."
4,"Super clean and friendly location. Workers are always helpful and attentive. I usually always come to this location due to the ridiculous Disney style lines next door at Chikfalet.The burger is always solid. Is it better than in and out. That old running debate. For me, it is an easy no. But, since I'm in Nashville and In and out is not, Five Guys is the winner here. There is plenty of parking to get your hamburger after spending all your money next door at Nordstrom Rack."
4,Some of the best Mexican food in Nashville with an incredibly friendly staff and an excellent tequila selection.  Arriba!
3,I love having different potato choices for fries.  I always make a point to grab some grub here while in Boise.
3,"we enjoyed the filet with au pois sauce, and were confused when they didn't serve us a steak knife...upon asking, we were schooled!
their meat is so tender, no steak knife needed!
i definitely recommend the souffle potatoes, don't leave new orleans without trying them at arnaud's.
turtle soup with sherry was unstoppable, i wanted to order a second bowl!
for those of you who aren't all that in to horseradish, steer clear of the shrimp with roumalade sauce (ick!)"
4,Love this little Italian restaurant! The simplistic and smaller design bring in a cozy family feel. Food is delicious and staff are very friendly and were able to fit our table of 6 in with very minimal waiting.
3,"Yeah the Foodery is a beast.  It can get pricey, but you can't beat the selection.  Also, check out the ""El Diablo"" sandwich from the deli.  Sometimes it burns twice . . ."
0,Showed up first time without the windshield. Showed up a second time with the wrong windshield. Third appointment they cancelled the night before via text message with no explanation. Incredibly unprofessional.
3,"Ducked in with Sarah Grace to talk digital marketing and it was a fine time, here's why: 
* Located right downtown
* Cool decor 
* Hottie hostesses
* Truffled Lobster Mac rocked had candied Siracha bacon (see pic) atop! #NOM! $13 

We also tried Grilled Beef Tenderloin for $18. Tre tasty. We finished off the tasting with some Spicy Tuna Tartare $14 and it was a fine time. 

Good stuff, great company! 

Cabeza OUT!"
0,"The worst food, and customer service I have come across in a very long time! I never write any reviews but I will not stand for the slop I was served tonight and the way I was treated when I asked for my money"
4,This was a all around kool bar!! Friendly staff and awesome games!! Love the beer pong section in the back!! Great to come with a group or even a couples nite!! Nice and clean and fun ambiance!! Nice and big TVs to watch the game!!
1,"No bueno. 

I was in town for a wedding and thought I'd drop by for a margarita and some chips and guac. I should have kept walking. I'm no booze-snob, but my margarita tasted like floor cleaner. The guac was brown, and my waitress seemed ticked off that we weren't ordering real food. I'm adding an additional star to my review for the patio. It was nice to get to sit outside.

Thanks, but no, thanks, Red Cantina."
3,"Clean, convenient location.  We were able to do our laundry there.  Lyft picked us up to take us to dinner about 5 minutes away, then the next day, also took us to Nashville.  Very convenient.  We felt safe.  There were a lot of the bus type campers, and dogs.  Everyone was extremely nice, and friendly.  Quiet at night."
4,Just ordered delivery - so yummy. Definitely recommend the sample platter and chicken kababs. Will be eating here again soon!!
4,"Shouts out to Jessie! He just  changed my life with this Kentucky Mule! First off parking is a bit whack. But i must say i have enjoyed  my time here very thoroughly! I love tbe fact that he knew whT i wNted before telling me. He was so understanding and definitely let us all know about the happy hour special, wine specials. Etc. He also posed for my pic that he made. Its an Kentucky  Mule folks with whickey and it is Fantastic! I have not seen Food or anything  so this is straight alcohol. Upstairs  is apartments, condo spaces,offices,etc."
3,"Not bad for the price honestly. My fiance and I stopped here for lunch and were both pleasantly surprised by the sushi options (lots of different rolls and nigiri which is only served at dinner at other places). It satisfied our sushi cravings and then some. Some things that stood out for me were the lomein, steamed dumplings, butterfly shrimp, steamed cabbage and oddly enough, the fries. We both commented that a few of the dishes could've been warmer but other than that it was more than worth the price!"
4,First time here and I was not disappointed. Crab Rangoon to start followed by tuna poke bowl. Friends got sushi specials and all were excellent. Looking forward to coming again and bringing my husband. Great addition to the neighborhood.
0,no star here all i can say is crackhead place 4sure ..nasty nasty nasty nastyn.......dirty dirty  ppl in there
0,Don't expect even an ounce of common courtesy from the staff at CRSVR in Santa Barbara. It is non-existent and I am so sorry our youth are being exposed to this kind of customer service. This is no way to run a business.
3,"If I *had* to choose between the two rival cheesesteak places, then Pat's would win the battle. 
The cheesesteak is good and I felt more comfortable eating there than at Geno's.
From what I observed the other night, when I made my first trip to either one, I noticed that Pat's was jam packed versus Geno's and I can see why. Great people, chopped up steak and way more relaxed."
3,"The chips and salsa were delicious.  I wish I could say I was blown away by the rest of our meal, but it was just good.  It wasn't spectacular.

I had the Enchiladas Super Rancheras which is 5 different kinds of enchiladas.  Sad to say, the cheese was the best tasting one.

My bf had the Hot and Spicy Burrito, which apparantly was only mildly spicy.

Maybe since we're from California we're kindof snobby about Mexican.  Yeah probably."
4,"This place is amazing!!! Awesome food, drinks, and ambience. I recommend the outdoor seating and the green tomatoes!!"
1,The Montecito burger is pretty good but the fries were way over cooked; I didn't eat most of them. My mom's fries were overcooked too and they were different than mine so maybe it was the person working the fryer that day? But since it's Covid we had already left to go eat at the beach. It would have been too much trouble to turn around and ask for fresh ones. That was disappointing for $31 dollars.
3,"This review is for the collision repair service. My husband has taken his Cadillac in for repairs twice already this year, but has received quality service from Lockhart both times. Both final charges met the original quotes. My favorite part was that they vacuumed out his car before he picked it up! It was such a pleasant surprise because his car is always so messy! I would have appreciated more communication since he had to call them to check in on updates after a couple days, but other than that, great work!"
4,"I had the best  experience at Wesley Chapel Nissan. I worked with Troy Stevenson, who was kind, courteous, professional and just an outright kind soul . He was able to get me a brand new Nissan Pathfinder within my budget( in fact it was below my budget) . This was the first time I was purchasing a new car on my own and I was blessed to have great friends who was able to contact Troy to help me. Highly recommend Wesley chapel Nissan!"
4,I went here on Sunday with my boy friend. The food was amazing. I had a Salmon Eggs Benedict. One of the best I've had in Reno. Everything tasted really fresh. The place was really cute. I love what they did with it. We also had exceptional service from the waiter and other staff. I will definitely be back.
4,"My wife and I stopped in for lunch based on the great reviews and Los Agaves did not disappoint!  

There was a bit of a line that went all the way out the door, but it moved quick and the food came even quicker.

We started with some guac, she had the Fajitas del Mar and I have the Agaves Enchiladas.  Both were yummy!"
4,"This is one of favoritest low key places to eat in Reno. Everything is pretty damn good, the lemonde and onion rings are some of the best i have had in Reno. The service is AMAZING. And the price is rite. Love this place eat here at least once a week!"
4,"This place is awesome. Locally owned and operated, from what I can tell. The food is simply delicious. Fair price (not cheap, not expensive), fabulous quality."
4,Even with all of the construction mess downtown right now I wouldn't recommend any other shop. I've gotten work done here for years and it just gets better. Kristin did an amazing cover up for me that is allowing me to continue down my arm with a beautiful design I couldn't have done otherwise. All of the work I have seen come out of Black Rose has been top-notch. The extra attention to cleanliness and safety is a major plus too. I've already recommended Kristin to several friends. :)
4,We can highly recommend Mark and this service! He called back in 15 minutes and we scheduled a time within the week. Mark showed up on time and his quote was very reasonable. We just came home and are beyond impressed with the look of our tiles and grout throughout the house. Great work!
4,This place is the place to go for smoothies in Santa Barbara. I highly recommend the red mango smoothie.
4,A great relaxing atmosphere with refreshing dessert. Highly recommended. My favorite flavor is the cheesecake. Tell them Teddy sent you!
4,We had just moved in a few weeks ago and wanted to get the locks rekeyed I called them on Monday morning and they were there within an hour and no extra charge for expediency they were just fast! Very nice very efficient
3,"Incredibly extensive menu and professional staff. A real unexpected gem of a restaurant in dowtown Boise. Sashimi was very fresh. Main dish could have been better, but it was quite good. Highly recommend the Mango with Sticky Rice."
4,"Carlos and the staff were AMAZING! The service was impeccable and everyone was so nice and accommodating. We opted for a great bottle of wine to go with all of the 16 different meat selections! If you're a carnivore this the place for you... stay away from the delicious little table breads though, so you have more room for all the meat!"
4,Ben spent the week with ryan and had a blast! Ryan picked up ben early in the morning and sent me picture updates throughout the day. He has been so sweet to my little puppy child and also helped train ben out of some of his bad habits. Looking forward to having ben spend more time with sb Doggy guy!
0,"I got the owner or manager. Girl blew through my nails.  I made an appointment, the girl on the phone said it would take 1 1/2 hours.... the owner spent 30 minutes on my nails. I asked for coffin shaped, hard gel. The tips are crooked and different lengths, the gel was laid on clumpy. She did a horrible job. And she charges $50 for this??"
0,Terrible customer service simply cancelled my order rather than trying to make it up to me or offer a solution
0,"Customer service here is unfortunately, like many, many, other places, is really lacking. I called just to get some information about if delivery may be available for an item and I was put on hold 4 times!!!  FOUR TIMES!  And to top it off, twice that I was put on hold I was put on hold while I was still talking with the person and trying to ask a question.  I really wish that a Costco was nearby so I could have another option."
4,A superb coffee shop- everything from the quality of the coffee to the handmade refurbished wood decor makes this place special and a true *must* if visiting New Orleans.  Miss Tracy's addiction is a true addiction- I wish I had something in Los Angeles that came close to the taste ! Coconut + honey+ cayenne and coffee is so simple but so unique.  Make this on your morning to-do list.
4,"Tire World is straight up, no nonsense. Decent, competitive prices on tires and service and they'll give you options, let you make the choice that works for you. Patty is great behind the counter. --They can get a bit busy some times, nothing unusual."
3,"I can't type, I'm in ecstasy.  Fried oyster PoBoy.  Quick service in a busy place with amazing flavor?  I.will.be.back!"
3,"I love coming here just to get the nutella and banana panini.  It's one of those foods that parents always forbid their children to have, and the children order  every chance they get.  It's basically a portable dessert for breakfast.  What could be better?  Service is so nice and they have a decent selection of offerings, including salads and sandwiches.  I just go for the breakfast items."
0,"V poor.  I could hear the micro wave pinging all evening.  The door handles and windows grubby.  The rice was hard like it had been made earlier.  I ordered a beef special of the region and was promised it was made to order.  Impossible.  The dish was evidently a long slow cook.  V dry and tasteless.  Ice cream for desert was full of icicles.
I'll not be in a hurry to return."
3,"Cute little shop where you can buy all kinds of niknaks! Pretty pricey but they have such cute things for ladies, babies, and awesome as souvenirs."
4,We have always had fantastic and professional care for our two dogs for 17 + years now.  Accolades to Dr. Jamie Whiting and the outstanding staff for their excellent treatment and positive customer rapport.  This enterprise is a great asset to this community.  Dan & Sherry Grossman  (Chelsey & Darby)
3,"This place is similar to you're average corporate theme restaurant...  Actually just  kidding. lol 
This place is really different and a lot of fun! I like to pretend I'm really on an island because it's little escape from the cold. lol
I usually just do appetizers and drinks, but I've had the dinner before and it is good and the portions are large. 
But I love the appetizer specials
The jerk shrimp and lobster and shrimp quesadillas are phenomenal!

Minus one star because the service is pretty iffy some nights"
1,"Mediocre food. Chicken ok. Strange, fatty beef. Disorganized staff that could care less. Other than that....there are much better places to eat in SB"
3,"Friends brought us to this place after a long day.   Brought some cold beer and allowed my buddy to order.  Im open to try lots of different foods but when he started with frog legs I was a bit concerned.  There was no need.   We like a bit spicy...  so the sauce had a bit of a bite, but the legs were good.
.  I wold not order again simply because everything else was better!  Bright flavors, well prepared n nicely decorated.   I'll be back!"
4,They get five stars for the beer selection alone. The rest is just icing on the cake. The live music is awesome and the staff was friendly. The prices are reasonable and on a weeknight you can probably even find a seat. I think this is definitely one of the best live music venues on Frenchmen St.!
4,"Beau performed annual maintenance on my A/C unit and was prompt, very professional and did it all without creating a mess.  He was very respectful and wore the ""booties,"" which I really appreciated.  Burgess is my A/C company for life!"
2,"Used to be my top choice for Korean food, but not anymore. In the past year or so the food quality has just gone downhill. Everything is now SO SWEET, esp. the banchan (small dishes). I'd say 2/3 of them tasted the same -- CANDIED. Very unappetizing."
3,Wonderful location- lots of interesting folks! The meatloaf sandwich was superb as were the turkey burgers. Split a banana cream pie slice-- next time we will each get one-- completely incredible! Chris our server was really friendly and attentive.
4,Try the Irish nachos ...a nice change from typical beef or chicken topped with corned beef.
4,"We ordered carry out over the weekend and found it all very bright and tasty.  Plenty of good vegetarian options as well.  Food was thankfully ready when we went to pick it up as promised.  Well done, Akar!"
0,"Although the moving guys were very good, the price of the service was extremely high. We asked for 2 people to help us move items from a storage unit into our truck for 2 hours. They charged us $562! Very disappointing and I can not recommend them."
4,"My obsession with this place is undeniable. Although I've never had an actual meal here, the $1 macaroons on Wednesdays have been amazing enough to earn my loyalty. Trust me, you'll feel like you're biting into a light, sugary cloud. The service here has always been good, and I've never had a complaint. This is a great place to meet up with a friend for brunch or after work. They serve Bee coffee, and I'm a big fan of this spot. Also, they have a lot of outdoor seating!"
4,"Best ice cream in Santa Barbara and perhaps anywhere. Extremely flavorful that you'll just want to keep coming back for more. If you're a local, get the axxess card for coupons."
3,"Nice and clean tap room
Great selection of Yazoo beers.  Good space to hang out 
Open tables first ce first serve.  

They have some food and a food truck"
4,Such a hidden gem! Tina is amazing and so is her staff. They are so attentive and they provide excellent service. My nails are always impeccable! I'm so glad they're only a short walk from my apartment.
1,Came for dinner time and proceeded to wait for 20 mins to get a glass of water. Once we did have a waitress the experience improved drastically. The food however left some to be desired. I had the chili Verde which was quite spicy. I also had a margarita which I enjoyed as it was quite strong.
4,Update: They have a separate gluten free menu with a great selection (they even have gluten free breaded chicken...yum!!). They also have a gluten free bread instead of the normal pretzel bread they bring out. Hooray!
2,"Service was spotty (and it was pretty empty) and the food, besides the cinnamon bacon, was less than stellar. There are definitely better Brunch options."
4,Nicely cooked steak.   Great fish.  Not cheap but worth it.   But definitely a great steak place for the area.
4,"Simple, fresh and perfectly delicious!  

This is probably one of my favorite restaurants in Philly.  Within the last year and a half that it's been open, I've been here four times and each time, I feel in love with the food all over again!  

There's something to be said about a place that is consistently great every time (and not just the first time)."
4,Had breakfast burro.  It was very good and fresh with a nice soft flaky tortilla. Even without salsa it was very tasty with great flavors.
4,"My experience here is always timely and pleasant. I feel listened to and respected, and I feel like a priority. My teeth look and feel amazing when I leave. I've gotten a few cleans, and had a chipped tooth repaired. I love the pampering with the parafin wax and customized playlist, it puts me at ease! It's weird but I love going to the dentist now! They are so nice, efficient and respectful. The prices are comparable and reasonable. I would absolutely recommend visiting 12 South Dental."
4,Had a phone reading (I live in California) with Aurora and she was very warm and didn't rush the reading at all. She was spot on about everything though shared some advice about my mom which didn't make any sense initially. Told my mom about it anyway and was blown away when she validated that Aurora was right!! Will certainly be calling Aurora if I ever need advice again.
4,Excellent bar and grill. Perfect foe the Mizzou or St Louis  sports fan. Highly recommend the cauliflower bites.
4,"A CBD gem! Everything I've tried has been absolutely wonderful. I love real food, and this is as real as it gets."
4,Every Jeni's we drove by had a line out the door. They have very funky and delicious flavors. I would recommend the sampler so you can try a bunch of their flavors and not have to decide on one. It's the perfect amount of IceCream
0,"I have been coming to this restaurant for years. It's a pretty good pizza and pasta place, especially good for late night. But now they have raised the prices exponentially. 1 order of spaghetti and meatballs is over $18 after tax. I could see if they changed it to a gourmet recipe, but they did not. So sadly my relationship with Sicilian has to end. Sorry."
2,"I had no complaints about the food, it was the same good food you get out Subway. staff needs to be trained on store hours and information about there services."
0,Room was nasty. Black mold on ceiling. Floors sticky. Room was very outdated. Hot tub closed. Pool closed at 7? Had to make reservations for pool. So much for made to order breakfast. Buffet for breakfast? Guess a buffet won't give you covid but fresh made to order will? Stayed at Days Inn nicer and for half the money.
2,"Certainly not the best fish'n'chips I've had. I ordered tge mix and match with 2 chicken 2 shrimp and 2 cod. The cod was pretty good a tiny bit over cooked and the shrimp was ok at least it was cleaned and cooked well but the chicken was terrible over cooked to the extent I couldn't finish it and I finish almost everything. The service was good, fast, and polite. I enjoyed the little extras they added that I wasn't expecting fried pickle slices, a hush puppy, and zucchini."
0,"They use the salad bar as a distraction for how bad the meat tastes. And if you actually think the meat tastes good, I'm sorry, please go to an actual steakhouse like butcher and singer. I literally wouldn't come back if they paid me too."
3,"This place is okay in my opinion. Being an indian myself I might have more pickier of taste but I would say this place is decent. They obviously have amazing paneer and samosa but their level of spice is debatable, sometimes I find it a bit mild. Even then I think this place is good enough to eat at regularly, which I do. I recommend this place especially during their buffet time its totally worth the money!"
4,"Excellent breakfast!  Omelette was great, home fries were fantastic.  Perfect spot between potato chips and fries!  Friendly service too."
0,Was very dissatisfied today. It took over an hour to get our first sushi order. Other orders were forgotten or did not come. I spoke to manager who did not seem to care. She said we know we understaffed yet they kept seating people when they knew the kitchen could not keep up.
3,"I had the chicken parm from the lunch menu. Perfect crunch and the right amount of cheese while still maintaining a juicy chicken breast. Excellent. 

And the side of pasta with marinara sauce was also very tasty. 

Next time the true test. I am going for the gnocchi.

Our server was attentive but not overbearing. 
it was a trifle noisy."
2,"Was not impressed with this location.  The interior seemed quite dated and the bars seemed a little smaller than most of the Orlando locations I frequent.  Went for my favorite meal, Sunday brunch and was very disappointed to learn they didn't make the Mediterranean egg pasta that I've enjoyed at a half-dozen other Sweet Tomatoes during brunch :-(

The food was good, the food was hot/warm and fresh.  No complaints about the quality, but the lack of some choices I've grown accosutomed to at other Sweet Tomatoes was a let down."
4,"I absolutely love, love, LOVE this restaurant. I have had the pleasure of having dinner and brunch here and I can honestly say that I enjoyed everything about it. The atmosphere is beautiful and the food is delicious. I would give it 10 stars if I could. Oh, and Eric is wonderful as well as the entire staff. I can't wait to go again"
4,"Ive been here for events! Its huge and on the water! Go outside and look at views! Take great pictures! 

I park at Marriott and its $10 to valet it there. You have a walkway from there to center. I recommend doing that! 

We went for a Wedding Expo and had fun! See pictures & videos 

There are a lot of cool spots to take neat pictures in there too! Check it out!"
4,Delicous food and large variety of tea. Im excited to come back and taste all the flavors. The lavender tea was really good and the atmosphere is cute.
4,"This boutique is a gem! The clothes, jewelry, shoes and purses are in pristine condition. There was a five dollar rack on porch- found an expensive, like- new red leather jacket hanging on it in my size!  The lady behind the counter was so friendly and helpful. What a wonderful place. Can't wait to visit again."
4,"These donuts were outstandingly fabulous. Last month, we had these donuts for my birthday. Everyone kept telling me, ""I love Deluxe"" and I agree. They have a wide variety of flavors from cream donuts to lemon filled, these donuts can not be beaten. No matter how far away, this is a must-have bakery."
4,Best in town. Sam and David hands down best in the town. Get your lucky lottery ticket here. Very reasonable prices.
4,"Fantastic!  Service and ambiance were exceptional, but were mere shadows in comparison to our tapas.   The heirloom tomato salad, with arugula, a balsamic vinegrette, garlic aioli and crustini was my favorite - so delicious that we couldn't share just one!  Major yum!"
3,"The staff is what makes this please my favorite beyond the delicious diner food! My son and I love to come and eat here, and we enjoy the atmosphere. His favorite server usually is on shift and takes our order very promptly. His food is always cooked perfectly and comes out fresh and steaming hot! 
Even when I order it to go, it's still holds temp in their to go containers.
Bring your patience and your appetite, because sometimes they do go on a long wait. 
But when you anticipate that, there is no problem!"
3,"The food is always really good.  And CHEAP.  

But the service is dodgy, even with a cultural adjustment allowing for ""authentic"" Vietnamese service that assumes diners want to enjoy a leisurely experience.  We play a game called Guess How Long It Will Take To Get a Diet Coke.  (Answer: anywhere from 30 seconds to never)"
4,"Just had our second Taste of India work lunch and I'm even more in love. Do you think they'd let me move into the restaurant and just live there? 

We got a HUGE order delivered and everything was amazing, once again. The star of the show, though, was called Navratan korma. It's this mixed veggie dish with a sweet, rich, creamy, slightly coconutty sauce. Dude. And the veg samosas are my boyfriend."
3,"Stopped in to check out the humidor for a couple of stories. My cousin and I had just played golf and he had bought us a couple cigars there. Needed lunch so loving the Cuban sandwich I ordered one here. It was fantastic! I will definitely return when in the area. One of the best I've had. By the way, there is a good selection of cigars also. Nice choice of wines. Staff very nice, a lot of locals seem to come here, they usually know best."
4,"This was our first time and the food was amazing, so glad I decided on trying them, it's close to us so it was an easy pick. I ordered online through Grubhub, and picked up at restaurant. Will definitely comeback, and maybe eat at the restaurant one day, they had outside sitting."
3,We really enjoyed our dinner here. The milkshake was not that great but the Cobb salad was amazing and my son and I's sandwiches were great as well. A little pricey but good. Great service.
2,"Good salsa, good sour cream sauce. Seated fairly quickly. Slower service. Waitress was a bit forgetful. Forgot our sauce, no napkins.   A table that came in after us got served before us but they did have a different server so maybe our girl was new. Food four stars, service 2.5 stars."
4,"I'm not vegan or vegetarian, however, this place ROCKS! I always visit when I am in town. My daughter who lives in Nashville LOVES Wild Cow (she is Vegan). My go to meal is the black bean 'burger' with cheese. Love the sides and the hummus! I have always found the service to be great and the waiters friendly! Also don't miss out on the deserts! They are FANTASTIC also!"
4,"The food, the atmosphere, the service, it was all fantastic. It's like stepping into Italy. Fabulous!!"
4,Growler's is awesome! The food is great (love the salad bar) and the people are even better. There's a nice bar area with a bunch of TVs for watching sports and the beer they've got is really good. Couldn't be happier about being close to this place. My new favorite restaurant for sure!
4,"I did a birthday party for my portable person, she invited her friends, I showed up with kids, cake and money.  great service, kids got a terrific and educational animal tour. Well run, nice people, great location. I'd definitely do it again."
3,"It may sound weird saying this in regards to a brewery but the tacos are the best thing about this place...specifically the short rib. They're insanely good and worth the visit itself. The establishment is in a neat, unique part of town, and boasts a cozy atmosphere. The beer is satisfactory and service is generally quick.  I'd recommend SLB for anyone craving tacos and wanting to try something a little off the beaten path."
4,"Best sandwiches in Tucson!!!! Forget about Subway and eegee's and all the other chains. Hogie House is the bomb!!! Love their Pastrami and Steak and Onion Hogies. I always order online and my order is always ready at the time I select and accurate too. Friendly employees too. I am sorry it took me so long to give them a try, try them, you won't regret it."
4,I love my fireplace!  The owner and staff are friendly and know how to make their customer happy.  They go out of their way to accommodate you and are willing to work with you.  I would recommend them to anyone.
2,"Love this restaurant. Food is good, staff are awesome but they need to learn to run a restaurant efficiently. There are ALWAYS tons of tables sitting empty while the crowd is lined up to be seated. They could up their numbers just by filling those. Also, the girls at the bar have to run inside to serve beer...put a couple of taps at the bar. Great place but the wait is making us rethink.

Just saying..."
2,"The menu LOOKS great! Soooo many things I wanted to try...however, everything I did try was disappointing. And the service?? Two thumbs DOWN!"
2,"Prices for breakfast were very reasonable, especially since the portions were huge.  My husband's corned beef hash omelet had lots of filling but he would have preferred it without the Hollandaise sauce topping"
4,"I came here for my first time today hoping to get my nails healthy again after a long hiatus of maintaining my nails (along with trying to do gel nails from home that ripped them up). Angelina did such an amazing job and got me back on track. She took the time to double-check and perfect her work which made it all the more wonderful.  The cnd also felt so much better on my hands than regular gel formulas and instantly felt healthier. I absolutely loved the atmosphere of the salon as well, so darling.  definitely planning on coming back regularly as much as I can."
3,When you're within walking distance of your residence in a foreign city you get thumbs up in my book.  Why? Because sometimes you run out of things and the person you're staying with has the car and you just need to go get it.
0,"First time at car wash. They wanted info and me.  When I said I didn't want to provide it they told me to go to another car wash.  I was asked for more than my name -- make and model of car, license , etc"
3,"Delicious, authentic, flavorful, spacious, friendly - an overall great place. The last two times we went the service was slow but it was the same guy both times so I assume just a bad apple among the bunch. This place is clean and has really cool decor. The food comes out fast and make sure to get a margarita - no frills or flavored, just on the rocks. One of the best rita's on the east side!"
3,"Always a good choice, especially for lunch.  I am often in the area for work and their lunch specials are always good.  I enjoy local, hand-crafted food (especially bbq) and this place is always a good choice!"
0,"Sigh..the dehumanization continues! America's #1 source for violent entertainment and guns continues to push society down the drain in this location by doing away with most all cashiers. By my count there remain but 6 human registers. Support humanity, shop elsewhere. It seems police cruiser is permanently posted there. Can't Wal-Mart afford private security. They can't just keep reducing/de-emphasizing humans and then act all clean."
3,"First time here, came with a smallish group and the service was good. Spencer did a good job.  I think everyone liked their choices of food. The have a social hour and a 3 course early dining menu.  I had sushi and it was tasty. Sunset roll and salmon sashimi were very tasty. The muddled  drink I had was just ok."
2,"Though they had very tasty savory crepes, the classic nutella and banana sweet crepe was the highlight. 

Service wasn't all that great but the delicious food made up for it. Definitely a must visit spot if you are in Ybor!

I give it 3 stars because the service could be better..."
2,"I had heard such great things about this pizza and multiple people say it was the best in the city. Maybe it was too hyped up for me, but this pizza didn't do the trick. I will definitely try it again to give it another shot.

I ordered the Hot Honey Pepperoni Pizza and the flavor was underwhelming. There was no Hot Honey flavor on it and that was the main reason I wanted this pizza.

The crust was good and loved the amount of pepperonis with the fresh ricotta, but overall not the best pizza in the city."
0,Ridiculously overpriced!! Juul starter kit is literally double the price at $80 when you can get it for $45 at a gas station. Kratom is double the price as well charging more than a dollar per gram! Probably the reason no one is ever in there. Don't know how they're still in business. I recommend going literally anywhere else!
4,Awesome service from beginning to end. Andres ensured that we will well taken care of from begin to end. Great staff!
4,I loved their food. The cooks are amazing and the food is a decent size for a very decent price. I work in Center City and order from here atleast 2 times a week!
4,Great food and service from a family owned small business.  I eat here at least three times a month and strongly recommend the chimichanga or stuffed peppers (chile rellenos) for entrees.  Start with guacamole Mexicano and queso dip with chorizo to go along with your complimentary chips and salsa.  Then round it out with the Texas Margarita and you will NEVER be disappointed!
4,Had shower unit installed.  Daryl was friendly and knowledgeable.  The quality work was excellent and professional.  The unit was installed in timely matter.  Jennifer and Daryl were great to work with.  I would highly recommend them for future work.
1,stars for the chocolate cake shake and that's it. I got that and an Italian beef sandwich with peppers for $11. I don't get the hype. Once I got home the sandwich was completely soggy (mybad since it had gravy) but TOTALLY flavorless. I ate about 5 bites then gave up. I'll stick to Arby's for roast beef but visit just for a shake.
4,"So thankful for a continuation of a vegan menu from the prior restaurant! The food is very accessible, super tasty and the owners are fantastic. 

Their burger patties are ""Perfect"" burgers, which are much tastier than Beyond or Impossible burgers. Kale salad is amazing and well seasoned. 

This is a great spot for the plant-curious folk! Definitely try it out. Excited to watch them continue and grow if we can support them."
0,"Worst Vegetable Pho ever tried. Over salty. I ordered larger size, surprisingly even less items than other Vietnamese restaurants. Servers are not willing to serve. Our food took us So Long wait to came to us...looks wall and tables are decorated  neatly, maybe that's the point got many high rates from other customers. To me, without taste, No point to step into this restaurant again"
3,Great outdoor area dogs enjoyed begging the for food.   Svc was fast and we had a nice view.  Noted lots of people coming w there boats.   Nice lazy afternoon quick food.   Tried several things all average foods.  But staff friendly and food svc was good.  Dogs behaved.  Nice corner to keep them in.  The hamburgers are a nice size.   Priced reasonable for sit down w great ambience.
3,"it's hard to say something new about sushi
this place has beautiful decor and very kind stuff"
3,"Beautiful space, great food & drink options. A bit on the pricy side, but one of the hippest and most stylish spaces in all of Tampa."
4,Helen is the best at doing gel nails. She takes her time! I've been to so many other places in Nashville and they don't do it as good! She really is super detailed and makes sure your nails look perfect
0,"5th street deli is now called Eli's.  Waited 15 minutes to be waited on !!!!!!!!!  Seriously.   1 customer in front us.  Another 5 minutes to make a corn beef sandwich and a pastrami sandwich.  $30.00 plus tax.   Pesky flies everywhere.  Bread was stale.  Been there, done that, not EVER going back."
4,"They have great tacos, margaritas, and chips/queso here. It's usually really busy so if you are looking for a table you will have to wait. The bar is sometimes open and I will usually just sit there.
They have excellent staff here as well, everyone is nice and quick!"
4,"Great food, great atmosphere. Stick to the fried chicken and cornbread and you will be a happy person!"
0,"Chick-fil-A is a favorite of mine but this location has really horrible customer service i felt like i was in kfc i think they need to clean house m, the food was great nd drive through is also excellent however the people in the front have no hospitality long waits and lack of communication every time"
4,"i love that you can take your zagg invisible shield back anytime to get another one for just $6. i think that's a great policy to have and keep customers coming back!

it's a little expensive for a screen protector for your phone to start out with, but, the $6 replacement makes it worth it. 

if your screen protector bubbles up or anything happens to it within the first 7 days of installation, take it back and get it replaced for FREE."
4,"Can I just say that this is my favorite Ace in the whole world?  Everyone who works there is majorly friendly and knowledgeable (today I got great service from Roshawn, I think was her name).  Makes for a pleasant shopping experience which is why I'll always go to Harry's before Walmart.  All the stars!  :D"
1,"I was just there for a wedding, very nice place, but main dishes were not so good, crab cakes were all filing, filet were covered with gravy and over done , rosette was over cook. Do not know what that paid per person but anything over 75-100 they over paid!! Appetizer were better then main dishes!!"
4,"Food was to die for. The shrimp they they serve with michelada was amazing. Next time I'm in Reno, I will totally coming"
4,"Stop scrolling! Bay Equity is the best. Mike and his team were amazing. I never thought I could buy two properties (in different states) within 5 months of each other especially during a pandemic. Mike and his team far exceeded my expectations and demonstrated how good they are in comparison to the other broker I had worked with. Mike was with me every step of the way. Calls, emails and texts returned quickly. It's so nice to have a team on your side to help you get the best rates, provide quality service and follow up after the loan closes. Highly recommend!"
3,"I've been to this place 4-5 times, and had the falafel bowl each time. The falafel is made fresh to order, and is quite good. They also have French fries made to order, so always hot and fresh! 

They have a few desserts, including a tiramisu that my wife says us yummy. Price is very reasonable for what you get. Overall, worth a stop if you are in the area"
4,"It just needs to be known that I visited LAST APRIL, and am still thinking about the fried alligator and the wood fired oyster roast. First experience with gator, and it was delicious. And the absolute best single oyster I've ever tasted. 

Guys, I can't even remember what I ate for lunch. All I can drool over mentally are the apps - though I do remember one of my friends getting the oven roasted gulf fish and being very impressed with how flavorful and delicious it was. If I am back in New Orleans again I have a feeling this would be the one place we would repeat!"
4,"Easily one of my favorite coffee shops and so many unique items on the menu, if you haven't already you must try!!"
3,"Great hotel for the price. 

Our room was very spacious and clean, loved the exposed bricks. The location was also great, just a couple of blocks from Canal St and all the restaurants and nightlife.

It's not the Ritz Carlton but at $100 Saturday night stay for four people it's a deal hard to pass up."
4,"The is no substitute for good thick cut bacon and they provide the best. Brisket has always been stellar. Ground meats are great and for what you get a deal. 

The best part are the people behind the counter. It take no time at all to learn your name and preferences. I gotta call out Adam who is always quick with a greeting and a call to serve. 

Great butcher shop."
3,"We stopped here for dinner while wandering around the French Quarter. The service was good; the host wasn't particularly welcoming, but our server, David, was great. He showed off his language skills--French, Spanish and Italian--while we were ordering and when he came to check on our table. 

We ordered the Gumbo Deux--seafood gumbo and chicken and sausage gumbo--and the shrimp and oyster po'boy. Both were quite good. The oysters were excellent and the gumbos were delicious. We'll come again when next we are in town!"
4,"awesome fish tacos!  (Grouper)

fresh toppings....  great lunch spot!  Counter service was fast and friendly.  They explained the whole
menu (since it's hand written on marksalot board).  We sat in the car, windows down....  but they have a few
picnic tables.  Id highly recommend the place for a quick bite!"
4,"We ordered from Carrabba's tonight after not eating there in 10+ years. We were hesitant based on the top reviews for this location. But happy to report that our meal came out perfect. Everything we ordered exactly how we ordered it. I had a craving for the Chicken Bryan (after 10
Years!) and it tasted exactly how I expected it to. Yum!"
3,Healthy tasteful meals catering to any age especially with the local UCSB Gauchos roaming around town.   The menu is diverse and the Nutrikit receipt w/ food fact's and questions is a perfect conversation ice breaker.  This is just a great place for a date.  Expect to spend fewer than $10/person and go for their home made chocolate chip cookie along with a fruit popper for a mini dessert.
4,"One of my top favorite Korean BBQ restaurants! My girlfriend and I came in for my birthday and couldn't have left happier. We did the all you can eat and it was worth every penny. The meat was delicious and marinated perfectly, the sauces were on point, and service was excellent. Jen was our server, whom was very attentive and helpful. If you haven't been here, it's a must!! Will be back very soon."
3,"Chicken sandwich was pretty damn good, elegant atmosphere, and reasonably priced.  Definitely recommend!"
4,Jesse was super accommodating with my order and made the perfect milk tea. Will definitely be coming back!
4,"We rented kayaks from here to explore Caladesi Island. The guy was very friendly and helpful, the rates seem reasonable & they give you a free water-safe bag for your phones and whatnot."
0,"The first time I went there was 7/12/18. We ordered a cheese steak, turkey sub and a tuna sub. The cheese steak was good. The turkey sub was okay and the tuna sub was not good. The tuna came out of the can and was place on the roll with lettuce,tomatoes and onions. We were given a mayonnaise packet to put on the sandwich. On a scale from 1 the lowest to 10 the highest score. The steak was a 8, the turkey sub was a 5 and the tuna was a 0 score."
4,"First time here :) the bbq beef is delicious and have a good service. If you guy go to Philadelphia and want to eat korean food , should try this place !"
4,"We have been here several times in just the past month and absolutely love it.  The homemade pasta, fresh red sauce, rich cream sauces and daily specials will have you trying everything on the menu.  My favorites so far are the lasagna, chicken parmesan, and eggplant parmesan.  My friend loves the chicken marsala and spaghetti.  Everything we've had here has been fabulous and well worth the reasonable prices, especially when you can bring your own wine!"
4,Been dying to go to the one in nyc and was so stokes to find it in Santa Barbara! Absolutely amazing! Had the paneer and pork belly paratha tacos. Both were amazing. Can't wait to try the others!
1,"They say a sucker is born every minute....
Never had a sales experience like that.... like everyone says... so pushy and won't take no for an answer.
I left buying more product than I'd ever want. And his first quote was for product adding up to $450?!?
WTF this isn't Botox!!!
Luckily the sales guy kept adding more lotions.. but still not worth it.
If your product is good ppl will return, instead this is now a place I'll avoid because of the sales tactics..."
4,"As a semi-vegetarian, I often have difficulty finding meatless food when I want to avoid meat. That said, the Mangia Panini Special is AMAZING. I love this eggplant panini.  I love that it's sauce free, and no one in the area makes anything like it. We order from here often."
4,This was by far my favorite Cuban sandwich of all the Cubans I've had to date. We were treated to a free coffee after the meal as well as a spin of the wheel which led to a free dessert. Over all the experience was excellent.  I can't wait to go there again.
3,The service was quick and efficient. Everyone was respectful and friendly. The price is was same as estimated before the day of the move. There were no surprises.
4,Went there for lunch.  Our waiter did a fantastic job explaining the menu.  Our food arrived quickly and steaming hot.  I chose the house seasoning for my boil -- great suggestion.  The portions was large.  Cannot wait to be back in town to stop on again!
4,"I love my nails! I got a full set acrylic , with gel polish. The guy who did my nails took his time and made sure I liked the color and length. The polish is smooth and the way he filed them and shapes them; the tech did a awesome
Job! I would highly recommend going here! They also have a very wide variety of colors to choose from. The salon itself is very clean and sanitized. Will definitely be going back for my refill."
2,"Good stuff but my expectations were incredibly high.  I think for those native St. Louisan's this is a legendary BBQ place.  I just don't have the emotional connection others do.  However, the line was out the door but it went faster than I thought it would.  I was through the line in about 15 minutes at the 11:30ish lunch hour.  I had the chicken platter and the truly best part was the beans."
2,Overpriced fancy Italian stuff. Got gelato here. The cone was not filled all the way with gelato so I don't know how they expect you to eat it :O.  Good if u are not a poor student like me lol
4,I work across the street and feel so lucky I do!  Wednesdays are double add days and they have really great deals on produce and other items!  Best prices for berries in town.  They also have fresh $5 sushi on Wednesdays!  The staff is friendly and I always have a good conversation while checking out.  This place and Trader Joe's are my favorite! Their prices are better than regular grocery stores too!
4,This is my second oral surgery for an extraction with Dr. Grellner. Frankly I never even took Aleve after both much less anything heavier. Great staff that provides great pre and post operative instructions.
0,"Service was slow. I received a cup with a bent rim. A bent rim equals a spill on my suit, shoes and car cup holder.  Bad way to start out the day.  Thanks Starbucks."
0,"What a huge disappointment!!!   Definitely not worth the money!!

Cute environment , bad  menu.!! My filet mignon was more on like  a cheaper cut from Aldi or.  bJs . The gravy  was  flavorless,   Egetaboe nearly raw.,other items were simply meh, and not overly impressive .  Too many dessert options and again mediocre nothing special .  I can't say anything had a wow factor, and most likely will not be returning.

I'd suggest the restaurant  pick fewer items for your menu and make them stand out!!!"
4,This place is the cutest! Lots of comfy tables inside. Warm welcoming atmosphere. Everyone who works here are the nicest people. Like they actually care about your drink. I'm a huge coffee drinker so lots of teas and coffee choices and easy to customize. Crazy!
4,Fun time. Great games and a nice layout. Beer and pizza are surprisingly good. Games are only .25 and you can play a ton of them!
3,"Typical wings and beer joint. If you are looking for healthy food, this would not be a top choice. We love the wings and the fries. The beer is always cold. The staff is friendly. There are a lot of TV's to watch."
4,"favorite sandwich in SB - #27, as someone else said ""will change your life""
for some reason, this location tastes much better than the milpas location - ingredients seem fresher and better - also, bacon here is heated to order, whereas at milpas, it is pre-fried and given cold"
4,"Where else can you stop get gas, grab a fresh made lunch, hit up clean bathrooms and encounter friendly staff?  Excellent at this location as always!!!!"
3,"I only get the juices here, but they are AMAZING! They are a little expensive for a gas station restaurant ($7 for 16 oz), but the owner will personalize your drink. I get the green machine extra spicy with ginger and cayenne and lemon. I'm a regular.

The only downside is that is in a gas station (kwik sak) that is pretty gross. Haven't tried the food, so can't speak to that."
3,Good pricing and delicous food. Ambiance and cleanliness is perfect as well. Some staff are nice but some lacks at customer sevice. There's no harm in greeting and smiling to customers.
2,"First time I've been here and I can't believe it's taken me this long to discover this gem! I got the Franco American which is a savory crepe with turkey, Brie, sliced apples, and arugula pesto. It was so yummy! Staff was very friendly too!"
0,"The worst of the worst. We gave this place a try TWICE and never again. The pizza isn't fresh, the employees can't follow simple instructions. And not to mention, the two times we've ate from this place we've gotten sick. Management needs to step in big time. The second time around the crazy bread was so hard and stale it could've been used as a weapon. There's NO excuse for that."
0,"The short bouncer here was saying some real racist stuff to us, we were shocked. When we tried to record him for proof he got really aggressive and tried to take my friend's girlfriends phone. Will never come back due to the security of this place. We didn't even go in"
4,Paul immediately responded to our request for help.  Came out to our house the next day to provide an estimate and advice. Showed up on time the next morning to install our attic ladder.  Had it installed and cleaned up within a few hours.  Will definitely call him again when we need handyman work done around the house.
1,"I just tried for the first time,the wings were not the worst,but I expected better since that's all they have,the fries were horrific just completely inedible soggy disgusting like soaked in oil,threw the whole order of them out.but the wings were mediocre"
2,This is a spacious restaurant on a busy street. The food comes out quickly and the prices are very reasonable.
3,"Great little bar w/ food. Loved the intimate nighttime vibe of low-lighting and candles at the tables. Very chill and relaxing vibe, and good selection of tunes in the background.

A small but tasty and unique menu. Same goes for the draft beer list - small but a nice unique selection. The staff was fantastic. I would be here all the time if I lived here."
4,"Super convenient, close and cheap. I was quickly picked up at my car and dropped off at the airport within 10 minutes.  Pickup at the airport was just as quick. Drivers were both very friendly and helpful. Check Groupon for deals."
3,"Tortilla soup is excellent. Plantains are great. Tacos are pretty good but not as memorable. The line and seating and atmosphere could all be better, but I'm all about that soup!"
3,"I love how up at the top there, in the business info section it says ""Wheelchair accessible: No"" This place is so packed with stuff you can barely walk through, let alone roll through. GJ has an insane amount of interesting shit. Nothing I'd buy, but it's definitely worth peeking around just to see how much junk, I mean, collectibles, they pack into the space."
4,wide range of non-dairy milk! line was a bit long but orderly and moved quickly. the bathroom was clean and the music was charming. i appreciated the heat and sweetness level of my chai latte. not disappointed.
3,Great Piano Bar... Awesome drinks. Architecture and Atmosphere are mind shatter. Parking and location suck though.
3,"Cool little collection of pinball machines approx 50 or so on the second floor . First floor had the same number of arcade games. Oldies and some newer one.
The commercial garage that makes up the pinball parlor is well lit and clean. The best part was the value.
$6.00 per person for 60 minutes. All the machines are set to free play .
We got here 8 pm on Sat night and there were a total of 3 people in the place. Not all the machine's were on so it's a 4 star treat."
4,"Excellent food, service, and atmosphere. Our party of 6 sat outside and enjoyed the beautiful day and live music. Everyone was happy with their food selections and drinks. Prices are fair. The staff is very friendly and our waitress was on point. We will gladly return!!"
4,"Good size salad 
Ask for receipt at register 
Can get regular water with cup
Quick delivery 
Plenty of tables and chairs 
Was very busy right after noon 
Would definitely go back"
0,"This is probably the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. Checked in at 5pm or so and couldn't even bring myself to stay the night in this place. I swear I felt itchy as if bugs were crawling all over me. I was afraid to look under the mattress sheet for fear of what I might see! I couldn't get it of there fast enough. Buyer beware, this place needs a complete scrubbing."
2,"I wish that you could rate service and food separately. The food at Kilroy's isn't bad. However, to get that food you have to deal with the slow service (both in the inattentive wait staff and long wait for food to come out of the kitchen). If an IU grad drags you to this place, be ready for a wait."
0,"Useless restaurant. If u r ready to eat cold food then this is the place for you. My family was served dishes and breads did not show up even after 30 mins. When we complained, no one even apologized. Definitely not recommemded"
4,"FYI... this place is located inside the Walmart. I used my GPS to get me there and when I ended up at the Walmart parking lot I was a bit confused lol

Shiva did my eyebrows and she was great. I have tried two other locations in Brandon multiple times and with different estheticians, but usually leave disappointed. 

My eyebrows grow overnight it feels like and I have tiny, fine hairs that people usually don't get, but Shoba took her time. 

For eyebrow threading is $9 which is the average going price. 

Give her a try!"
3,"I searched Yelp for a lunch spot near my hotel but the place I intended to go was packed, so I stopped here. What a great decision!

I had the ""Vindaloo Chicken,"" apparently the most popular lunch item, and it was delicious. Use caution if you're not into spicy food, it has a slight kick.  Followed up with the Panettone for dessert, an interesting and tasty blend of sweet and bitter burnt caramel over what is basically a fruit muffin."
0,"Make sure to not give these people your credit card information , they will charge you without your permission , I'm in the process of filing a dispute with them . On top of that they are over priced , I got my eyebrows tinted and it maybe lasted a week and I payed about 50 dollars . I guess they are more focused on scamming customers and stealing money then they are on their work . Latoya should use the money she steals to buy good quality eyebrow dye that doesn't wash off within 4-5 days"
3,"This was place is okay. Today we had a great service, last time it was very slow even though they weren't busy. The pho itself is made out of frozen veggies and then we get fresh sprouts and basil on the side. When I spend $15 for a lunch pho I'd expect the veggies to be all fresh. A bit disappointing. Convenient location, easy parking, free soda water."
4,"Delicious, delicious, delicious, nothing left to say! Husband and I both had the off menu specials, incredible. Our bill totaled $100 and we felt it was well worth it, for drinks, entrees, and a shared Bread pudding dessert."
0,Didn't really care for the food. There were a few of us that went & everyone pretty much said the same thing about the food & we all ordered different dishes. Only thing that had a good comment was the lemon pepper wings.
3,"Really fun, large bar on Frenchmen with lots of locals and good, diverse music. Bottled beers are pretty cheap and plenty of space for dancing. 

A big bonus here is the delicious fish tacos... Mmmm"
4,"Wow. Just. Wow. We had the classic milque toast, the salmon and the cheesy spring. Freshness, cleanliness, portion size and taste were perfectly on point. This place won't stay tiny and hidden for long."
4,Edit because I reviewed the wrong location. My complaints are for the downtown Holiday Inn Express.
4,"Excellent place to get a pint. Came here during the All-Star Game craziness and was instantly recognized as an out-of-towner after a quick introduction I was welcomed right in like a regular.

Great atmosphere with a legit irish flavor."
4,"Great food! Nice staff, friendly people. Atmosphere is awesome true mexican with a flare."
4,"Went there during the restaurant week with my girlfriend. Great food, romantic atmosphere. The waiter was really nice too. 
Make sure you try the Mojito. I had the best there."
3,"A welcome addition to the area.  

The warehouse concept and bakery they're known for remains (as do the more than reasonable prices, thankfully) but they've added an expanded meat and seafood section (including sushi and marinated proteins), prepared meals, hot bar, salad bar, and coffee/breakfast bar.  There's also a candy store but I must have missed it.  

Beer and wine, too.  They need to greatly expand their craft brew selection and ""mix-and-match"" six-pack options offered by Wegmans and Giant are not offered here but hopefully will be in the future."
4,"Saen Mullix (Asst General Manager) is awesome! He & his team go above & beyond to make your stay comfortable & amazing. Caitlyn (Front Desk Lead) is very accomodating & is extremely knowledgeable of her job. Saen's love & passion for his job will bring him to the top, in no time! This team's exceptional customer service is best-in-class!"
2,"The food was absolutely delicious! I had the lobster paella and I loved every bit of it. The cocktails from the menu here are not so great though. The servers seemed to know a lot about the food and drinks but they took a while to come around every time and completely forgot about some stuff we asked for.  The view is priceless, but the experience overall was just a 3/5..meh.  I could have had something way better for the same price just down the street back at ground level.  They do take Discover though."
4,The staff was friendly and helpful with any questions. All of our food was fresh and full of flavor. Will be back for more
3,"Breakfast was sweet. Just remember, TWO people for every ONE entree. The omelets are massive six-egg omelets. An order of eggs is three eggs. The ""side"" of corned beef hash is a mound that even bigger guys would be hard-pressed to finish. The corned beef hash entree is a 3lb mountain."
1,"Very loud! Couldn't even have a conversation with the person sitting next to me. The calamari appetizer was almost un-edible. Some pieces were over cooked and tough while others were undercooked. Entrees were good. The hostess was extremely rude, however; our waitress was pleasant enough. Not sure I will return."
2,Solid beer but service seems a little disinterested in assisting customers.  Good addition to this part of town.
0,"There are so many Mexican restaurants in Tucson.  I recently ordered fajitas
here.  I was happy the table made salsa was good because it served to cover the taste of the fajitas.  The spices on the chicken & beef were so so bad,  the McCormick fajita spice pack would have been tastier.  Also,  the fajitas were way over priced!   I recommend you try any other Mexican restaurant in town."
4,"LOVE this place! I used to live in Boston where there is a competitive market for Korean restaurants. This place is definitely on the top even compare to the ones in the big cities.

The taste is so authentic, all the side dishes are made in the house, service is nice and prompt. Oh and a delicious mint patty comes after a meal!

Only have great things to say, it's also my Korean friends' go-to place in town :)"
0,Being a big Indian foodie.. This is easily by far the worst restaurant and the worst hosts. Ordered simple good.. Took 35 mins to let us know they were backed up. And another 10 min to pack the good. The lady who I guess manages the place should stop making faces at guests and show some class since this is supposed to be a fine dine.
1,"The food is terrible.  The view is great.

Clam chowder was way too salty.  Chili beef nachos were really bland.  I was glad we just tried this place for just appetizers since the entrees are pricey."
4,Love their hamburgers & fries.  Cheap & good!
4,John did an excellent job cleaning my chimney and reworking the connection between my furnace and the chimney.  He is a true professional and I would highly recommend him for any work you may need performed on your fireplace or chimney.
3,"One shot coffee. 

Brunchy coffee shop on the weekend, hipstery coffee shop all the time. Brewing stumptown beans, this little place is great to check out when you need to escape from the world with a book or newspaper into their ""library"" lounge space. This place is off the path enough to be a pleasant surprise. And try a baked good, they're always changing."
2,"Great docs, convenient location, lots of free parking and great services. One caveat: watch you bill, carefully. My FSA paid the balance of my bill not covered by my insurance and Penn Medicine overlooked the payment (even though they cashed the check) and then sent it off to collections!"
0,Worst nail salon I have ever been to. My nails look terrible. I do not recommend going here
3,Don't let the sign outside turn you away from this place. It's a really nice place. The food was excellent and the service was great. The only thing that we didn't love here was their Brussel sprouts. The bubble bread was outstanding as well.
4,"If you love quality, fresh food then you must try Giovannis!  The food is delicious and the service is terrific. Because everything is made from scratch you can relax and have a drink while you wait for your food to be served...believe me it's worth the wait‼"
4,"Professional, caring , well functioning staff , who handle the details with care. Front desk is easy to talk with, very welcoming upon arrival, timely phone calls and on target w the details. My vehicle is like new after their technicians performed service. Impressive outfit. Congratulations on comfortable customer waiting area. First rate organization !"
4,"We called around for quotes and checked reviews before choosing General Transmission to install a new transmission in our 2004 GMC Envoy.  Our contact was Ricky Ross and took his time to explain the process and lay out options along with the quote.  
GT installed our new transmission and had is back on the road on under a week! 
Its been a month since we had our transmission installed and it has performed perfectly from the first time we put the car in gear. 
The team was professional, quick, and charged exactly what was expected. 
 GT was a pleasure to deal with and we enthusiastically recommend them."
0,Convenience fee?  I'm confused. Who was it convenient for?  Why was I charged a fee for walking in?  They had no nail dryer and just looked at me like I asked where the gold was kept when I was shuffled to the door in wet feet. I wasn't pleased with the service. It wasn't that it was awful. It just wasn't worth 62$ plus a service fee and I paid a cash tip so I don't want to hear negativity about that.
4,So excited to finally have a good vietnamese place in the area!!! The food was absolutely brilliant. The broth was delicious with a good amount of noodles and meat. This really hit the spot! One of the only places in this part of NJ that has AMAZING pho! Will definitely be coming back many times!!!!
0,Bunch of skank hoes work here and can't sing especially that slut Danni shes a damn tramp
3,"Gordon Biersch is exactly what it looks like: a chain restaurant attached to a casino. It knows its place and doesn't try to be something it's not. Keep in mind, however, that GB is definitely on the high end of the chain restaurant spectrum. This unapologetic approach is what puts GB higher on my list than a Benigan's or Applebee's.

Check it out during a Saints or Hornets game. The bar will be bumpin.

It's not the best food you'll ever have, but you'll probably have a lot of fun eating it."
4,"perfect little cupcake shop. It is a small place, but hat just adds the homey feel of it. If you are going to get any coffee, I recommended the lavender syrup! You will die after tasting the deliciousness!"
4,"Great experience at an outstanding restaurant. The owner served as the hostess, and she was very friendly when she seated us. The service as good, but the food was terrific. I ate the pork shoulder and gnocchi. It was a top 5 meal that I have ever had in my life. The pork was perfectly seasoned and very tender. The gnocchi was perfectly cooked as well. Miel was a great experience, and I would highly recommend it."
4,Food was perfect and reasonably priced.  Very courteous and accommodating of having a golden retriever with us.  Will definitely go back.  The courtyard area is beautiful!
3,"Good food, small bar, enjoyed! Sampler platter was great! Cochran de lait poboy was fantastic, very different.  You should try it."
1,I certainly hope  the products are really good. Since I must have had a moment of weakness and allowed Sharone to sweet talk me with his fast talk and nice accent. I ended up spending over $260 for three items.  After reading numerous reviews on the sales tactics they all are trained to push on to the innocent and gullible (me) ..will see. Next time I will be sure to walk on the other side and ignore!!
4,"Jayna is awesome. Had the best selection of dresses of any place I looked, and also provides extremely helpful and honest feedback about which styles work best for the particular client. She made the entire process enjoyable and perfectly tailored my dress.  I've recommended to all my dress shopping friends."
0,"Considering they just opened I expected more. For yesterday's lunch we had a waitress who got sulky when asked for extras, like utensils, and this is after only 5 days past opening. The menu is terrible and limited to strictly bar food. The plates were plastic. Oh, and I've a raging head-cold today, which makes me wonder how sanitary is the food handling. Bottom line - this place is a watering hole and if you're interested in watching a game and tying one on, go for it. Outside of that, avoid."
4,"This has to be my favorite taqueria in Tucson! Everything is always fresh and delicious! I just had a Vegetarian Tostada and a Cheese Quesadilla for lunch, and I could not be more satisfied! This place is highly recommended if you want some genuine Mexican food!"
1,"I have a 2 year old son that goes with me everywhere including shopping, unfortunately this store does not provide carts with a place for kids to sit. So it goes without saying that my shopping trip to this store was quick with no purchases"
0,"This place was genuinely over priced, and not worth the effort. The food is decent but not worth the 20$, a better option would have been the brewhouse, they have unlimited mimosas, good food and a friendlier staff. Kids under 10 eat free there, el torito charges 7$. Plus the new ""valet"" addition is clearly another way to make more money off of the customers, I don't need someone to park my vehicle less than 5 feet away from the valet stand. Very disappointing place"
4,"Cool vibe, outdoor patio is peaceful and wines are good. They only have a few whites, mostly red. Definitely will go back"
4,"I wish this place had more locations! Everything was delicious and the service was excellent. We ordered Bao with beef/crispy tofu for appetizers and a couple of Ramens for dinner. We ordered the miso ramen and the tonkatsu ramen and it wasn't super salty like I was expecting. Honestly, the best ramen I've had in a while. I highly recommend coming here if you're in the area!"
3,"This is where you want to be if you want to FEAST LIKE A KING!!
This is one of my favorite places in philly. There is a decent wait for your food to come through, but that's only because it takes time to create something great, which their food is.
One of the waitresses there isn't very fluent in english, but to me, that only adds to the authenticity of this place.
Thank you killimajaro!!!!"
4,Good communication between the owner and the driver. Punctual pick up. Driver helpful with all 6 of our passengers and belongings.
3,"I know everyone loooooves Deli Towne, but I honestly don't find it to be anything special. It's not my favorite sandwich place in Reno, but it's close to my house so we stop in occasionally. It was $17 for 2 small sandwiches (one turkey and one Cuban). We came in at noon on a Saturday and there were a good amount of people in line. But they had 2 sandwich stations and they employees worked fast. So we were in and out quick!"
4,"We went in about 5 minutes before closing (something I hate doing but we were leaving the club and needed food), and they were actually very nice about the situation. I ended up getting 3 slices for 5$. You can't beat that. Thin crust, good flavor.. normal ""NY"" style pizza down in Florida."
1,Boca Loca was really just OK.  We went for apps and split the sangria pitcher and I have just had much better.  Cheese quesadilla app is different than what you expect and the sangria had a decent flavor.  I am biased in the fact that I did not try full entrees but I am not sure if I will be compelled to venture back.
1,"Food tasted to commercial! The drinks were good, and the bread is great! Good atmosphere! Little to pricey for the quality of food"
0,Don't bother going. Until the owners and management decide to make repairs to the building and deck. Food is subpar at best. Had to return the fried coconut mahi as it smelled fishy and tasted even worse. Left after our drinks were finished. Didn't trust eating anything else there.
4,"Ok I live in Maplewood, so I love all things ""The Wood"" but this place is really good.  I have been there twice now.  Last night I went by to pick up food to go and was going to order the Grilled Peach salad I had last time because it was really good.  They had a new item on the menu called Peach Salsa Chicken with swiss chard hot slaw.  Oh my god was this good!!!!  Perfect size entree with loads of flavor!!  I will be back"
4,Sapporo 2 has the freshest sushi and their flavors are amazing. I have been for lunch and dinner and both are great. The lunch special for around $10 comes with soup or salad and 2 sushi rolls. It's my favorite spot for sushi at lunch. Their gyoza and the firecracker are also wonderful. Their ginger salad dressing is my absolute favorite and I swear I could drink it. There is a blonde man who is almost always our server and he is incredibly knowledgeable and very passionate about food. Come here and you won't regret it!
4,I love this place! It makes me happy to know that there are places like this that are actually succeeding! I am in Santa Barbara for business quite often and I always make sure I stop here if I am having lunch with someone. Last time I was there Luke Wilson happened to stop in. Ha! Try anything they have and you will be happy.
4,Love love Shoefly! Whether lunch with colleagues or a wine night with friends Shoefly never disappoints. The food and drinks are great but most of all I love the overall vibe.
4,"A low key find. The staff was helpful and friendly. 

The museum itself was smallish but well curated.  We paid $5 for the house tour and enjoyed that as well. 

I would recommend this for someone casually interested in learning more about the local history, but maybe not for a deep dive."
4,"Tye is great! I cannot say enough good things about him and his car detailing services. He showed up on time and did a great job on all of my boss' high-end cars. My boss was thoroughly impressed, so we are now using Tye's services on a regular basis."
0,The only reason this place gets 1 star is because of the honesty from the waitress who told us not to eat here. Should've listened to her..
2,Food Good Service ok.  Only one waitress and she is cuban...  I ate here twice good food both times.  No Alcohol.   They are friendly food was prompt.  the place is small.
4,"My experience was absolutely pleasant! All my questions were answered, the experience of purchasing a car is always a head ache but this was completely the opposite! Everything went smoothly purchasing my vehicle with you guys! I can't thank you guys enough! Highly recommend!"
4,"I must be polish bc this food is home. Herring appetizer, sausage and cabbage mushroom pierogis yes."
3,"Yum, just yum. What this place lacks in decor, it more than makes up for in food. I'm a fan of the spicey schwarma, but everything is good. The owner only seems dour;  he has graciously accomodated custom requests. There are plenty of selections for those who eat meat and those who don't. It's BYO as well!

No one has talked about the deserts! They are fresh and homemade. They look small, but just one is plenty. 

Am going to miss this place."
1,Nice setting by the water but food was not up to par with prices and ambiance. Appetizers took forever! Waitress blamed it on a large party! What? The kitchen can't handle too many orders? The seats were very uncomfortable for the long wait. No cushion on a steel mesh chair from the sixties. The waitress brought food and then forgot about us until it was time to bring check.  I will only go back to sit at the bar area closer to water and reservations are not needed.
4,"They did an outstanding job and I recommend their service. They were on time, professional and affordable."
4,"Wonderful dining experience. My only note is the the appetizer portions are particularly small. The salads however are very large. We got a salad, crab cakes and each had the filet with lobster. We were stuffed by the end. Very good."
4,"Just got my breakfast order....it's the biggest breakfast order I've ever seen...holy moly! My pancakes were bigger than my torso, and about a pound of breakfast potatoes. Veggie Omelette was awesome! Everything was great! They didn't forget anything, the napkins and condiments were enough for a few days...along with the breakfast. You can not go wrong. Haven't had anything else from here, thinking I should give it a chance..maybe I won't have to food shop this month!!!"
4,Was feeling nostalgic for NYC today and this was the perfect cure. I loved the staff and ofc their work product. Can't wait to come back!
4,"Very fast. Reasonably priced, and Efficient.  Two very good technicians recognized and corrected the problem. I don't think I could find a better company to fix my door."
4,Absolutely love this tanning salon! Left a different tanning salon to come to this one. Never gotten so tan so quick! Awesome deals too!
2,Average food. Nothing felt especially fresh or homemade. The outdoor patio is very cute though and they had someone playing live music which was nice.
1,Burgers are great.  Hostesses are rude. They are never accommodating with families with children.  I always feel like we are bothering them when needing a high chair or a place to park a stroller.
4,Bianca was great. She took her time and was thorough. She was friendly and so were the rest of the staff. I was able to relax   I definitely recommend the Minimalist Salon.
2,"Convenient location, good parking, clean, relaxing decor & music.  My manicure was fine. I felt some prices were a little high. Employees are devoid of personalities, only one seemed capable of smiling and watching one customer try to engage her technician in any conversation was almost painful. I doubt I'll go back."
0,This place is disgusting. Pizza is the worst pizza I've ever had and it's way overpriced. Workers are rude as hell too if I could give it zero stars I would
4,The Duke of Zoup has arrived!!  This place is the best.  I really wish there was one near my home in western PA.
0,Very worst customer service we've ever had anywhere!!!  They have an outdoor patio with an opening to the bar. We like to sit there because we can bring our dogs.  Two bartenders were totally ignoring us and no waitress or waiter came out to us.  We waited for more than 10 minutes before leaving.  The blond bartender gathered up her purse and bag and left right before we did at 4:20. Very bad customer service and there wasn't even a big crowd inside.  We're going to give Quaker Steak and Lube our business instead.
4,"The rock shrimp pasta dish was delicious!
Was disappointed in the burrata salad because they use cherry tomatoes, but the burrata cheese was good.  Bread and ricotta also excellent. A must try Italian restaurant in Franklin!  Forget North Italia and go here. So much better!"
4,"This meal is amazing. The steak was prepared to perfection. The Mac and cheese is the best side dish to go with it. My server was Stacey herself and she was great. I was seated at the bar and she was attentive to me, the other 13 people who were at the bar when I arrived and she took to go orders at the same time. This place is definitely worth coming to any time. Oh and there plenty of televisions in the bar and restaurant area so if you worried about missing a hometown game don't be worried."
3,"Freshest smoothies downtown. They use actual fruit! Island Impact is my favorite. The ""small"" is filling and an excellent on-the-go meal replacement. If they were cheaper (or at least offered a smaller option),  I'd add that last star."
1,Bad company to work for. Starting off a minimum wage.. being a slave... Bad management. Great co workers but low moral
1,Worst service everytime. My waitresses always seem like they're on drugs. Today I went and I got soup and then my meal before my drink even came. Was not checked on once during my meal. Drinks always either taste like no alcohol or straight alcohol. Everytime I am there my service is so slow. Food and prices are the only thing that keep me going back. Excellent food especially the soup.
0,Worst bourbon chicken I've ever had in Florida. Beyond burnt. On top of that the lo mein had a burnt flavor. And the honey chicken didn't have a separate dipping sauce. They just poured like a tablespoon of sauce over chicken. Will never order from there again
4,Best burger in philly. Try the Angus burger absolutely delicious!...Excellent take-out service!!
4,"Samantha did such an amazing job cutting my hair!! I have very thick wavy hair & she left it so soft & manageable. She also fixed my at home bangs. Samantha was so friendly & funny, she's definitely my go to now!!"
3,"I ordered a Bun Bo Hue and sashimi platter. The bun no hue was a good level of spicy, though I wish my bowl had pig's feet and huyet. Moving to Tucson, I didn't expect any good Vietnamese restaurants. However, Saigon does a good job. It's weird they serve sushi, but the sashimi was fresh, so no complaints there."
3,"This place was really cool and laid back. I had the Cajun Sampler and it was delicious! The beer menu was extensive. I recommend getting one of the local beers. 

You must be 21 to even enter the restaurant so it is not good for anyone under 21."
3,"Overall great Cajun food with reasonable prices, portion sizes, and great staff. I ordered the seafood gumbo, which was delicious! I will definitely come here again."
4,"The food here is off the charts!!! The best crawfish pie I've ever had along with fried alligator and mac n cheese casserole (yes they're appetizers but made a great meal). 
Love the setting of the restaurant and the staff are all great and very helpful in recommending something you've never had. This meal made my whole trip to New Orleans."
4,Came here for some basic laser eye surgery although they perform just about every type of outpatient surgery.  Was very impressed with the attentive and timely treatment by the staff.  Easy parking and access - not like going to a hospital parking lot.  I was in and out in less than two hours.
3,"Always great margaritas & cold beer. The best, freshest salsa with nice, dime size chunks of tomatoes in it. Had the spicy white fish last night and it was fantastic!"
2,"I went with a prepaid restaurant certificate. Even though it was bought 3 days
ago they refused to honor it. The sandwiches were already made so we were
stuck paying for them. These people obviously don't stand behind their business.
The sandwiches were good but however, there refusal to honor the certificate
left a bad taste in my mouth. You think they would be more concerned about
making a customer."
3,"I love the atmosphere of Ramen Bar. We went with a group of 9 and they were able to accommodate all of us within 5 min. 

I have been to a couple of Ramen places in the city. I can't say that it is the best I have ever had but its up there with the best in Philly among the place I have tried.

Although this Ramen can get a little bit pricey once you start adding things to the meal. I added a marinated egg and extra pork. 

It was tastey but the price of it was a little bit more expensive than I would have liked."
4,I found pizza yea on yelp last night and it was the best gluten free pizza I've ever had. I drive all over the east coast for work and have had my heart broken with bad gluten free crust. This pizza won't let you down. I'm headed back tonight.
1,"A place like this is why i stay away from bars in Mayfair. Over priced drinks, and its basically like a high school reunion. This is  where the Hoe-bert girls anf judge heads hang out, so if your into underaged girls and ""beer muscle"" boys this is the place for you."
1,Why did I bother the time to put in my order 3 hours ahead of time and pay in advance so that I can show up and find that the order  isn't ready yet? Instead of a serious apology she tells me to sit down and wait while they get my order ready.
3,"This is my third trip, and it gets better each time! Had the mild sausage sub first, which was just ok for me. I'm spoiled by hot sausage. Had the eggplant parm last time and I almost couldn't stop. I however saved enough for lunch the next day, and like most Italian food it was better next day! Had the meatball sub tonight and wow, all I can say is datsa one speecy spicy meataball! Really good, so it's a hit with me. Have to try the pizza next."
3,"Got the tenders and was worth the wait. ONLY reason this doesn't get 5 stars is because of the horrendous iced tea. Literally spit it out as soon as I sipped it. I even brought my own Splenda to sweeten it to no avail. It was grosser than gross and bitter. So from that, Southern, please get a better tea and sweeteners. Chicken and ranch were on POINT! Mashed potatoes were the way to go."
3,Salmon burger was awesome! With my taste for spicy food (which is almost always) & being a pescetarian its hard to find a place that can accommodate both. The sangria behind was one of the best I've had in a long time!! Definitely will be back.
4,"Today is the first day they are open for brunch. The menu has a little bit of everything for everyone. 

Staff is friendly and service was fast. Large plates. And the potato side for the breakfest rocks with a little bit of a spice."
2,"Cool spot, great location.   Good for drinks and a snack.  Not a large menu selection, maybe an app with your beer and then move on."
3,It has been a really long time since I ate here but I will review it anyways.  Chloe has this incredible charm and feels like you are getting the best home-cooked meal in a tiny little restaurant.  This is a great place to come for a date and is a cozy BYOB with exceptional food.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it is so small it can sometimes feel almost a bit awkward if there aren't too many other people there as well.
4,If you're into Asian milk teas bubble teas or alternative smoothies this is a must go to place expect to pay about five dollars or more per drink but the drinks are worth it. Also had the egg custard waffle things that look like little animal paws  and they were delicious. Once they re-opening seating this will be an Amazingly cute place to bring a date.
4,"I love Tidy Dog, and they love my dog! I feel really comfortable leaving my dog with them. He is a 12 year old Staffordshire Terrier who is honestly a lot for me to handle, yet somehow they always get his nails done & give him a bath with no issues!! He always is really happy when I pick him up & he acts like he doesn't want to leave! I would highly recommend Tidy Dog to anyone!"
4,Why this place is awesome? Because of the people. Everyone is so amazingly nice and accommodating. The food is a plus! The short wait was not bad because the host was nice enough to give us coffee while we waited! That's just great service! We will def return back here when we visit!
4,"Fun atmosphere, good music, reasonable drinks, and good old fashioned burger and fry kinda place! Vegetarian friendly too! A St. Louis staple not to be missed!"
0,"I have tried to give this place the benefit of the doubt - and went in there recently to look for a dress for my daughter who is going to be in a wedding. They had a couple of very cute (and VERY expensive) dresses - however - the lady who works there is so horrible, I walked out.  I then found a great boutique in NJ and found the SAME dress for about 30% less."
4,I've been going for just over a month. I never get bored because there are so many options of things to do. My trainer at the beginning was Cullin. He was awesome and gave me a really great start. The staff are amazing. I never come or go without a big hi/goodbye greeting. It is an extremely clean facility and the change rooms are fully equipped everything from shampoo to hairdryers. I could eat recommend this gym more......and I checked out a lot of gyms in town before finally making my decision.  Well done World Health Mayfield!
4,"We love Jasmine Thai! Our favorites are the orange chicken, drunken noodle, spring rolls and of course the mango sticky rice! Staff is always friendly as well! We love visiting."
4,"The wait staff is friendly and knowledgeable! The food is always tasty!  And the atmosphere is always right, do small to larger groups.  Love the outdoor pods!"
4,LOVE! Potato Leek and Smoked Black Bean are delish. Nice small place with cheery folks behind the counter. I make a trip here whenever I'm in the neighborhood.
0,"They claim their spicy chicken is real chicken .. it is not chicken, but merely fatty scrap pieces of pork!! False advertisement folks!!"
4,"This place was so very accommodating. We had a group of 9 & when we called to make a reservation & found out they were closed that day, they came in so we could enjoy a delicious lunch! We would highly recommend this restaurant!"
3,"Had dinner here tonight very friendly and polite waiter. Had the yellow curry, Thai iced tea and mango with sticky rice for desert. All of it was very good."
2,"Wouldn't come here if you're looking for a great meal. Tuscan fries were cold and soggy, got charged for a large salad as an appetizer, my girlfriend got a turkey club and it was also cold but the cheese was melted? Buffalo cauliflower was pretty good but they were out of the ""blue cheese fondue"" which they didn't tell us til it got to the table. Nothing special."
3,"For our last meal in New Orleans, I really stuffed myself at Eat!  I ordered the crawfish pie with fried green tomatoes and rolled myself out the door afterwards.  The tomatoes were probably the best I've ever had, light breading so you could really taste the tomato.  The crawfish pie had really great flavor, it's just a heavy gut bomb so beware! We also got the crawfish croquette things as an appetizer and those were great.  It's a cute little place and the food was solid, I recommend."
3,My friends and I and searched for a really nice Happy Hour location that would be great for a girls trip!! This place was IT!!! GREAT DRINKS!! Nice atmospher.
4,"Best wing in the world to me 
5min away from my house 
10min for the order 
5min to get back home
30min to eat
1hr Nap"
3,Really loved the food and location. Our server was super nice and very attentive. Overall everything was delicious- My only surprise was that the side veggies were just boiled carrots and broccoli. Not what I was expecting or wanting. I figured I would get some more traditional foods like plátanos or maíz for the expensive cost of a dinner platter. Aside for that I was really happy with my experience.
0,"Don't do it.   Took forever to get our food, and the order was messed up.   They ran out of iced tea before 7 pm.   Then the water was never brought.  Chips were cold and slightly stale.   The food is nasty as well."
4,"I was involved in the floods in August and am currently trying to replace my vehicle.  I already have a 2015 Kia forte, so automatically I decided to return to premier Kia to purchase another vehicle. Circumstances did not allow me to make a purchase on this day, but Mr. Greg Alexander was an awesome help. He was very patient with me and understanding to my needs also in listening to my situation. He gave me some great tips on handling my situation. I would definitely recommend you trying them out. Ask for Mr. Alexander....he won't steer you wrong!!"
3,"This place has the best touchless car wash in all of Tucson. Very speedy and courteous service from every employee, every time. The prices are fairly reasonable and they have a wide range of options, depending on if you only want exterior or the interior done too. If you're a frequent washer, the monthly subscription is worth it because it pays for itself after just a couple of trips."
1,"Unfortunately, they have the best hot fingers in town, because the service is always horrible.  Every time we go there, we hope it'll be different, but we leave in an awful mood.  The waitresses are very rarely friendly, almost never get a complete order right and are painfully slow.  Today we had to wait 10 minutes after being seated to see a waitress.  As much as we love their food, the only good way to eat here is by carry out."
4,"Great place to grab your friends or a date night. Great music and people! The food was also good and affordable, will definitely be back. Service was awesome."
4,There is really nothing else like it. It's a mix of deli- restaurant-wine bar- and farmers market and I'm diggen' it. They have a great variety of meat + cheese and there wines are super affordable. They have plenty of outdoor seating as well as a cozy wine/beer cellar that doubles as a tasting room several times a month. LOVE this place.
4,"Someone referred me here to get my dog washed, so I brought my labrador retrievers here for a bath. I was pleasantly surprised about this do it yourself pet wash. It worked wonderful! I will definitely be bringing them here again for future pampering. It's so nice because I don't have to bend over to bath them. They even have a blow dryer. I would recommend this to anyone that has a hard time bathing their dogs at home."
3,I always eat here. Great authentic Mexican style tacos without the greasy mess of your typical taco. Pupusas are great and homemade style carne asada plate. 4 stars because the carne asada could be cheaper. Still and all they have great Salvadoran and Honduran food. They also sell good Horchata.
3,"In the area.. wanted to stop by to see if they had next year's calendar....

The calendars are great because the have very useful gardening tips!

Wasn't really expecting to purchase anything...

Unfortunately, they had 25% off shrubs..
and I found some great ones!

Will be back again for the calendar..."
2,"The service was fine, but I wasn't impressed with the burger I ordered. I will try them out again and order something different. The burger just wasn't anything special."
4,"Pretty sure I was the first customer when they opened in a little closet-sized space on 7th a few years ago. The owner was out there offering up samples. I'm a vegetarian and virtually all restaurant soups use chicken or beef stock or broth. But he was ready for me with a vegetarian KGB Borscht. All of the flavors just melded together perfectly. Really, it's by far the best soup I've ever had."
4,This place is very well known for brunch. Very cozy. I found that servers have tattoos on their arms. We had Quatre Fromage Omelet and the special menu Ribeye Sandwich. The sandwich was awesome! Omelet was good and I like the fried potato came with the omelet. I definitely will come again and try other menus!
1,"Good selection of beers. First visit there with friends. Service was good. A little pricey on the menu items. Didn't find the food to be great but just ok. I would return for the atmosphere as they have trivia night and a large bar to sit at. But not a fan of the food. Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing, tacos. As they all tasted the same."
4,One of our favorite spots in South City and a true neighborhood gem. High quality Italian food and service. I walked in tonight but I recommend calling for a reservation on the weekends. The price point of the toasted ravs is steep but totally worth it! The lobster risotto isn't on the menu but is always a special which they are known for. The portion is huge! Tonight we tried the lemon panna cotta for dessert which had delicious tart lemon curd on the bottom and a fruit compote on top. Delicious!!!
3,"Great place for air and space enthusiasts.  Somewhat pricey.  5 stars for the friendliness and hospitality for our dog.  Doggie bowls and water fountains were available.  Our trip here is during the hot summer weather.  Wear walking shoes, this includes your dog."
0,"I wish I could have reviewed this place properly, but I was turned away at the door at 8:30pm when Broadway was kicking! I guess they don't like visitors. Oh, by the way, I called up see what time they close the kitchen.  10pm."
4,"I'm very excited that Litterpaw opened up in my neighborhood. They just had their grand opening last weekend, and are getting in more and more supplies for my little man every day. The owners are super receptive to stocking whatever customers ask for. They are going to start supplying Merrick dry food just because we asked. That's what a neighborhood store is all about, great service! If they don't stock what you want, just ask to see if they will get it for you!"
4,"Without a doubt best hot chicken in Nashville, no in Tennessee, no in America! If you are a fan hot chicken very hot is really hot. I bring out of town guests here.   I consider this place a landmark!"
3,"Pho ga or chicken pho.  What about it?  It's authentic here.  It should have a light color, the pilsner to the bock of pho bo.  It should taste of the lighter coriander instead of anise and clove.  It comes with chopped chicken with the bone, a by product of making the stock with only whole stewing hens.  The chicken meat robust and slightly chewy.

If your Pho shop doesn't meet the required needs above for Pho gà, what other items might not be authentic?"
4,"I tried all the indonesia restaurants around Philadelphia area. By far
this is the best one.   The owner(waitress) is very friendly and the food
is good and the price is very reasonable.  I like especially the Fried 
Banana."
4,"My new favorite! Their cheese dip is the best I've ever had. The Carettas dip with the chicken, steak, and shrimp is to die for! I have been twice in the last week and tried the quesadilla and the lunch chimichanga; both were stellar. My husband tried one of the specials with shrimp and mushrooms and loved it too. The decor is modern and different from the typical Mexican restaurant. Staff is incredibly friendly and pleasant to chat with. Fast service and attention to detail. My new favorite spot for sure."
0,"This place is so over-rated.  If you can get the bartenders attention (even when the place is mostly empty), they have an attitude that ""you are lucky to give them your money and drink their beer"" when you can get one.

This could be a cool place if it wasn't for the complete a-holes that work there.  

Have to give one star since I can't zero."
0,The worst chicken Marsala I've ever had. It didn't even resemble chicken Marsala. The meal was basically some kind of seasoned chicken with mushrooms. AND the restaurant was slow.
3,This used to be one of my favorite restaurants when they have the location in Wayne. It's still a wonderful place to get a meal it's just a smaller location
0,Can't say anything about the food.  Placed my order at 4:37.  It's 5:30.  No food came out of the kitchen AT ALL for 45 minutes.  The owner eventually came and a bunch of people complained.  Food finally arrived for us one hour later.  Not acceptable in my book.
4,"Excellent experience!  Dr. Rodriguez is fantastic - personable and kind, communicative, thorough and involves the patient.  Plenty of staff to sign in patients, do vitals and assist, and all are very nice.  This is the first ortho office I have been to that has not run late.  I'm used to waiting at least an hour past my appointment time at others.  Highly recommend!"
4,"There is a reason this place has five stars... And if you could give it serves, you would. The food was absolutely phenomenal. We had our two young children with us, but despite the diner style seating, they were able to do just fine. Just note, no high chairs. The owner was as pleasant as he could be. Everyone was a friend or amigo...and he made you feel that way. This will become a regular stop every time we are on our way to Tahoe. Thanks for a great experience!"
3,"The flavors here are dope. For my last bday, I got a dozen cupcakes from here, and they were so pretty and very very tasty. You're paying for freshness, location, and the cool flavors, so not an everyday treat, but for special occasions or for trying something new, this place would be perfect."
1,Food was ok at best - brewery beer was good. Service was terrible - had to ask for everything.
4,As good as it gets featuring jack Nicholson because their food is great and everything about this place is perfect
4,"Great food! 
We always order the asada fries. But today we ordered a torta al pastor and a burrito . 10/10!"
4,The freshest deli bread anywhere in Center City. Very friendly staff that's willing to accommodate any special requests.
3,"Theatre seems to be smaller than it looks on the outside.  Very congested between the ticket area and snack area. Eat and drink before coming! $14 for 3 small drinks!!! Overall pricing is ridiculous. I prefer GDX. More space in the walk ways, even when chairs are reclined."
3,"Stuffed French Toast (a little too much stuffing in between)
Chicken Soup-Delicious

Everyone else's food looked great and the service was good (even though my order was forgotten)

I would come here again but they need to do some expanding.  The place is very small and the wait, extremely looooonnnngggg."
4,"Thoroughly enjoyed our date night here. 

Our waiter had extensive knowledge of the menu and was really friendly. 

I got the filet mignon. It was prepared beautifully. Juicy tender and delicious. The au gratin potatoes were creamy cheesy and tasty. 

They serve bread while you wait for your food. 

My husband's meal was prepared table side which is really neat and fun. 

The atmosphere is romantic, intimate and feels semi formal to formal. 

Definitely recommend."
3,"This is my favorite place in center city to grab sushi. The food is solid, if not very imaginative, and the $10.95 three roll special is the best deal around for sushi. I typically get spicy tuna, salmon and avocado, and a california roll. This is a standard stop for me when I need to pick up food quickly.

The place is a BYO, but it's incredibly small (even by Philly standards) and so I have never eaten there. This is a great place for takeout, and they'll deliver if you hit a minimum."
0,"When i arrived upstairs I was ignored and the sales people were just hanging out not helping other customers. I had to seek them out instead of the other way around. He turned out not to be very helpful. I will never buy from them. This was about 4 months ago, in Jan 2020."
2,Food is ok place is a little dumpy don't think I will be back would rather go to la teresita food and service I s much higher better there
4,"Yassss. Amazing vegan eggrolls and spring rolls! I've been waiting for a place like this, and such a great location!"
4,"First Chicken and waffles I have ever had. They were delicious. The pecan butter and the Tabasco raspberry jam...mmmmm. The staff were friendly and attentive. We had a bit of a wait due to lunch rush and a few larger groups, but were seated promptly. Excellent experience."
3,A really good place for el pastor tacos and salsa. Tastes and smells delicious. I always come here for taco tuesdays because their tacos are only $1.50+ tax each. They make their tortillas from scratch so it makes the tacos even better. I definitely recommend coming here for lunch during taco tuesdays. The pastor tacos are to die for. The only thing that sucks is that their parking lot is so small and sometimes it is hard to find parking because it is a shared parking area with two or three other places.
4,"Great place.  Good atmosphere.  Love the beer drinks, 
Really awesome.  Great selection of beers. 
Gary and Lauren are the best.  Other bartenders need to work on the Personality thing.   Overall really great place."
2,This place is so so for me. The Sushi is good but not great. The way they prepare some of the rolls just isn't my style. A blender is used to make some mixed fish rolls.
0,If I could give zero stars this place deserves it! My friend and I were visiting from California and these bouncers wouldn't let us in since they've never seen an ID outside of the Philly area. I'm sorry if they don't know what an Oregon or California ID looks like before but I've never been treated so rudely!!! Go train your bouncers better so people that come to visit your bar won't feel like shit!
3,Good food. This restaurant is a destination if you love food. The flavors are fiery. I came for a friends birthday dinner and a complimentary cake was offered to the table which was very nice.
2,"Usually, love scoopers. However my BLT (bacon, lettuce, and tomato) was quite disappointing."
2,Only give this a 3 star because the service was good and friendly. The Go to burger wasn't the burger to go to. The fondue cheese on it was horrible.  And I wasn't to impressed with the soup that came with it.  I guess I just ordered the wrong thing.
4,"Brad is the best, best service and one of a kind. He is very genuine and cares about his customers!! I got the toffee ice cream with a shot of espresso, as recommended by brad, delicious!!!"
4,"Stopped by after work the other night to get a drimk and LOVED this place!! The bartender, Alexandria, was super friendly and made me the BEST margarita. I initially wasnt going to order food but Alexandria convinced me to try the SAGE PECAN SALMON and i'm glad she did because it was OUTSTANDING! It was a wonderful combination of flavors that had me craving more. Will DEFINITELY be going back and am going to tell all my friends about this place. When you go, ask for Alexandria. She's the BEST!!"
4,"Absolutely amazing!!! Half rack of lamb chops wit Mac and cheese and broccoli and add shrimp. I believe it's teriyaki sauce they put on the lamb, its soooo good. I drive all the way from Newark, NJ just for their food. Love the bug portioned sides too"
2,"My family and I have visited this restaurant multiple times and have had a similar experience every time. Overall, their food is okay"
1,"We come every year for a conference and it's one of our favorites. However today the service was horrible. They messed up a simple order 3 times for two of us and we waited 50 minutes. There were only 11 people in the whole place so it wasn't bc they were busy. The waiter was rude, rolled his eyes when we asked for separate checks, and got mad when we mentioned the order errors."
4,"First time here. I tried the V-Twin Vege burger. Mushroom, kumara and sunflower seed pattie with truffle mascarpone and pomegranate sauce AMAZINGLY GOOD! Also had pumpkin carrot motobites with chipotle aoli! Awesome. Plus the service was excellent I highly recommend this place!"
3,"Very friendly staff that are super attentive. All of the ingrediants seemed fresh and we found it an enjoyable evening.  One thing that could be improved is letting customers know where all the condiments were in the back. We found them as we were leaving, which was a total shame. We will go back and have a more seasoned exoerience, LOL."
4,Great place for cheesesteak or burger!  Really small joint but makes everything from scratch!
1,"Years ago, The Mosaic Café AKA Teresa""s Mosaic Café was a great place to eat.  Before it moved up hill and before the second generation took over the  management. . Now it is mediocre food, mediocre (to awful service ), but with a great view."
4,"I was in a real bind.  I had lost the keys to my motorcycle and was expected on a ride out of town the next morning.  Anytime Locksmith was there exactly when expected and, within a half hour, I had a new set of keys for my bike and made the ride the next morning!!!  Fast, courteous service!  Would recommend this service to anyone!  Thanks again!"
0,"Tried to call there to make a to-go order and was informed that they have ""closed indefinitely.""  Sad. Not many crawfish places in the Bay area, unfortunately."
3,Enjoyed the food. Sunbathed at the small beach across the road . Then ate inside the Inn On The Gulf. Patricia served us and she was great. My wife had a broiled seafood platter. (She gave me some.). I had peel & eat shrimp.  Plus the BloodyMary with 3 shrimp cocktail . I can't have alcohol so they made it a virgin. Good food - we will be back.
4,"Great vegetarian food. Service is excellent. For anyone who loves Indian food, this is an excellent location. I would highly recommend you try. You will not be disappointed."
0,"Should be ashamed of themselves!!! And they are suppose to be here to help our pets??? I think not. They should have their doors shut. For good.

4,"Pretty much the best Chinese buffet place in town!!! Always is clean, servers are friendly, and the food tastes amazing! Centrally located so that no matter where we are in STL we can swing by for a great meal."
2,"Good food, terrible service. We hadn't even been there for an hour when our server asked us to leave so he could seat another table. I was still actively in the process of eating, and my husband had ordered another beer, which he brought to him in a to-go cup as he was kicking us out. I've worked in food and beverage for a long time, and it was truly one of the weirder things I've ever experienced."
2,"Pretty average. There's a decent rush for the downtown crew during the week. I usually stick to the french onion soup and it's always fine. Nothing frilly about the place, but it's a good spot for a quick lunch."
3,"I always have a great time seeing these guys, ""Superbad,"" here. They ROCK the 80's and bring everyone along for the ride, screaming the whole for the whole ride. Such an incredibly good time and a great night with some old and new friends. How could it not be a good time?"
0,"Eric is a fraud!  He'll come out for the LivingSocial or Groupon and then charm you into a package deal.  Once that's locked in, he will either never return calls, reschedule or keep making excuses for why he didn't show up.  I turned in a consumer complaint and plan to continue further so others won't have the same bad experience."
4,WOB is killing it! Stop in for some wings to go. Have a cold beer while you wait. The service and the food is on point. I like to get my wings extra crispy. Their blue cheese isn't like any other. A cold IPA and some WOB wings is where it's at!
0,"i live in the area. got tacos there once, they were good and reasonably priced. giving a 1 star review because every few months they canvas the area with their menus. they stick them in doors, on cars, everywhere. it's obnoxious and the menus frequently blow away. shame on you for deliberately littering all over bucks county. i will never give them my business again because of it."
3,"Such a great spot for bbq. Great service, friendly staff and tasty bites.
Very very casual 
Enjoy"
2,What a cool find! Never even knew this place existed. Came across it be accident the other day. So far I've only tried it once but enjoyed it. Food and drinks were fine and I love the whole warehouse vibe. The only thing I didn't like was the whole dog friendly thing sometimes gets on my nerves.
4,"Amazing outdoor pool area!!!
No towels for rent.
No locks to borrow.
Lots of open space and machines.
Nice private showers in the locker room."
2,"Food was solid overall. Service a bit slow. Drinks / bartender fantastic and the outdoor space can't be beat. Please consider heating up your brownie before serving w ice cream, would turn an average dessert into much more."
4,"My husband, friends and I eat at Tacos Flacos every week and it is most definitely the very best, authentic Mexican food in Pinellas or Hillsborough counties!   George and his wait staff have always been prompt, courteous and engaging.   We love Tacos Flacos!"
0,Looking for a extra storage close to home. Walked into office and stood waiting for 15 min and left. Staff could have cared less.
4,"The best BLT in town!!!!  And I mean the BEST!  I've loved this place for 28 years, great family owned establishment!  They are the best!    I met my husband here,  need I say more!!'"
3,much better pizza than you'd expect in the UofA area being made by students that have other things on their minds.  The atmosphere in the area is vibrant and fun and of course they serve beer on a festive patio.  If you've been out of college for a while and want to bring back memories stop by and hang for a couple hours... then get your butt back to reality!
4,"I worship at the alter of Lauren at the Hair Designer! She has been my stylist for almost 2 years, and I wouldn't dream of going to anyone but her! She is knowledgeable,  outgoing,  and aware of what looks best on you, regardless of the trends. Plus, she makes you feel so comfortable and at ease when you're in her chair."
4,"Really great job, wonderful husband and wife team.  I would definitely use them again in the future."
4,"I went with a group of 20+ people who all got the buffet. It was nice that the servers pulled together tabled to make it so we all sat at one massive table. The decor is modern with bright colors. The owners were lovely and the servers were great. The food was delicious! The buffet even had vegan, vegetarian, dairy free, and gluten free options."
1,"Started coming years ago on solid recommendation, but will likely never return. Sat through shift change, day bartender was pleasant until she became intoxicated, night bartender was unacceptably and aggressively rude from the start. Used to feel like family, second star is for that nostalgia and the people who work there and don't deserve to be lumped in with the bull."
4,"I've been going here the entire summer of 2021. Clean, spa-like atmosphere.  Price is average for the area for most services.  They do have a selection of pedicures that help with enjoying the experience.  I make an appointment and it is always honored.  There was one occasion when my Nail technician needed to be off on my scheduled appointment day and they called the day before to notice me.  The staff is very nice and professional."
3,"Food is very good here and cheap. Don't expect fine dining. This is more like a ""mom and pop"" type place and definitely authentic Vietnamese food. The banh mi is worth trying especially since they are relatively cheap. Only down side is that they are only open to 5pm. Otherwise delicious!"
3,"Great variety of pizzas, clean & modern. A meal here is worth it. Lovely selection of craft cocktails, small patio but cute & likened with lovely planting's. Location is nice, plenty of street parking. Go check it out!"
4,"A gem ""hidden"" in Kenner, with oyster po-boys on par with the best places in New Orleans.

Mom moved to Kenner post-Katrina, and I've been very happy to make a trip here every year when I come home for Christmas.

(At first I thought: ""Have I been gone from home too long? Have I forgotten what a great po-boy tastes like? Why is this so GOOD?"")

After a couple of trips into New Orleans, I realized it's not my imagination.

This place makes a truly excellent po-boy."
4,"This happy hour is lit! Located in the W hotel, the bar is spacious and comfortable. Sit at the bar by the mixologists to get tips and history on NOLA classic cocktails - sazerac and bitters. Jeb and Chris will take extra special care of your crew."
2,"The suite was clean and front desk and maintenance guy was great. Now for the bad the drains were clogged, the hot water was non existent. Nothing like taking a ice cold shower when it's 15 degrees outside. The walls were paper thin and guest next store kept us up all night fighting. The elevators are the slowest I have ever experienced even in third world countries don't know how this place is rated so high, we would of been better off staying in a days inn."
4,"I've been to Texas Roadhouse many many times in Melbourne, Florida, North Las Vegas and Wesley Chapel.  Each time, the staff seem to enjoy their work and are customer-centric, the food is always consistent and the price is reasonable.  Salad plates are chilled, lettuce is crisp, steaks cooked perfectly, sides always tasty, iced tea is brewed as it should be.  They have a formula, and it's working."
2,"I've been going there for a few years. The gym is ok, the need to clean it better. But the manager Jen is horrible!! She does nothing! Doesn't care. She just has it easy there. She does whatever she wants. The guy there I think his nme is Edward, he is good. He cares. But Jen, she ignores your calls.... she should get fired."
1,"Nice bar located downtown, the bartenders think they're hot but they are not.the bar back was running around doin all the work, and when you're a bartender maybe you should have a little personallity and smile instead of having a constant bitch face.i won't be coming back to this bar and it's sad bc the bar was cute and actually clean..it's just the bartenders..try hiring some hot straight guys to bartend."
4,"Great place for a sandwich and drink. within walking distance to the convention center, nice to get a break of  the hustle and bustle. There  are 2 Cochon restaurant  the butcher is the actual sandwich shop, I figured out that the hard way :-)"
4,"I always have a good time here. I can walk there from my place on Mass Ave, so it's a great choice for fun after dinner. Their Halloween Costume Party was a great time, and the special seasonal drinks are always fun and delicious. What's not fun about candy in your alcoholic beverage?!  I'm hosting a party there for my apartment community next week and we were able to reserve some of the large tables by the downstairs bar for free!"
3,"Wow! Love this place! Food is DELICIOUS!! Kudos to the Chef  Beer is MUCH better than KBC! Live Band on Saturday night, great space, not tripping over tables. My new hang for sure. Only draw back is no waitresses so you have to order your food at the bar. (I prefer to be waited on ) Otherwise, a big two thumbs up!! Highly recommend."
1,The seats are not very comfortable. There are several obstructed views. The acoustics are not great either. I saw the Broadway production of Chicago here and I was not impressed by it or the theatre.
1,"Cool looking place but the front desk service was so poor I won't be back or recommend anyone staying here. I'm not a picky person but being treated like we were made for a pretty crappy start to a trip. All we wanted was to check in and get to our room but instead were harassed about a mask when others were walking around without one on right next to us and not a word said to them. If you're going to be a mandate police then be consistent, at least."
4,"Best Mexican restaurant in NO. Both locations are stellar. I love the lobster tacos but I must say after 20 visits I have yet to have a poor meal or service. I won't bore you with a margarita review because you have already heard how amazing they are. They are. I LOVE the sangria.  Lastly, the owner seems to always be present. He is a delight. Friendly and always smiling. Give it arid you haven't. You will not be disappointed"
4,"They offered us samples! I got the lamb shawarma. It was awesome, spicy with a delicious sauce. Sorry for no pic, was so good I devoured it immediately. It was so good I went back and got another sandwich: mix of kufta and lamb shawarma, equally tasty. 
Staff is so friendly and we had a good chat about the culture/history of Morocco!"
4,"Great restaurant and a great atmosphere. Visited before a concert on a night when the Cards/Cubs series was going on and despite being standing room only, had a great meal. We started with the calamari which was cooked to perfection and for entrees had the snow crab and charbroiled oysters. Very prompt service and excellent selection of mixed drinks. Will definitely be back!"
4,"Awesome atmosphere upstairs! View of the river and a lot of patio dining. Just what we were looking for. The bartender was great, she went out of her way to get what we needed and the service was quick. We got the beignets and brisket cheese fries. The beignets were decent, but the cheese fries were incredible! Definitely try it out!"
4,"If you like barbecue you have to stop here. As seen on diners Driveins and Dives they have great pulled pork, beef brisket, ribs and much more. It's a little ways from the French quarters so take an Uber or taxi and they moved once so make sure you go to the correct address but they are great !"
0,"The owner and ""manager"" is an extremely rude person. She wants to handle everything herself and not rely on her crew for anything. She needs to absolutely get over herself. Everyone except her were very friendly and attentive."
3,"Cartes Des Vins is a small marvel. Ready to dip your toes in the wide river of French wines? This is your place. If there's a serious oenophile in your life, they'll enjoy the selection and more importantly, the vast knowledge of the owner, Rick. 

Imitate, unassuming and friendly is the vibe whenever you shop here. There's weekly tastings and a room that can be reserved for small parties."
2,I went there on a Saturday for some lunch and it was incredibly busy. We had to look for someone to seat us after ten minutes of browsing around. After being seated we weren't greeted by a server for at least 15 minutes and it took over half an hour to bring out a panini and soup. Needless to say the service was neglectful as they were simply just to busy to even notice an empty glass of water or to be efficient. The food was great however and I would probably return.... I just was really disappointed with the quality of service.
2,Terrible tonight . GREASY. Told to make a google review about it. So they'll address it...
1,"I always like embassy suites however this place could use some work! Did mobile check in got room, thought someone was still staying there. Was not cleaned from last visitor. Went down 9 floors to get new room. Was given another room, coffee pot did not work! On way out to work at 2am as front desk to have it fixed! Still not fixed!"
2,"First time visitor and we showed up at 1:30 on a Wednesday and my husband was so happy he could still order breakfast.   We were quickly seated and our drink order was taken.  The menu is varied, so something for everyone.  

Service was great and I ordered a patty melt with fries.   Not the best patty melt I have ever had.   There weren't enough onions or cheese.  The fries were scant and nothing special.

If you want average food at an average price, this place is perfect."
0,"I enjoyed the bread.  Do not get the skinny chicken tacos. When I received my order, the chicken was hard and dry. I was so hungry I ate anyway. In the middle of the night I started throwing them up."
3,Been here many times through many owners. Still pretty good for a cheap Indian buffet. What I love is that they still hand write the names of the food on a paper placed in front of the dish.  So unpolished!  I guess that makes it the real deal.  It's fast and good and cheap.
4,"The food is fresh, the service wonderful. The chicken souvlaki in a pita with tzatziki sauce and a side is a true bargain and consistently delish. Key lime pie, incredible. The bar area can get a bit smoky and loud, but you can try to get a table away from the bar if that's not your scene. Still, we've eaten at the bar many times."
4,"Best beer selection, delish food and awesome art :) can never go wrong with that combo!"
4,Fresh coffee and fresh baked banana bread to start the morning. Love this local place where everyone knows the routine...great service...even better food and drink quality!
1,"I ordered a pick for spicy tuna roll crunchy and it unbelievable that they would charge an extra 50cents for the sweet Mayo. Sure, I bought it and don't care but things like this where places like these nickel and dime leaves a bad experience."
4,"I've been coming here over 10 years. I put 243,000 miles on an Escalator and it still ran and looked new. A lot of that goes to these Firestone guys. I don't trust anyone else with my tires. They only sell you what you need, and that's hard to find."
2,"Stopped to get a sandwich before flight back to Atlanta. I got the Mediterranean sandwich on wheat bread. It had hummus, red peppers, and artichokes. The sandwich was okay. The service was great. The staff was attentive and nice. My meal was about $14 with bottle water and chips. Might stop here again due to lack of choices in Tampa terminal on Delta (Blue) side."
2,"There isn't much to say- you guys have covered all of the bases! 

It's not a big place by any standard, but very neat and clean. I've been able to pick up some great stuff, mostly in the housewares department. If you're a better bargain fancy-pants than I, then it'd be more about the great designer deals for you... Go get 'em!"
2,"I was disappointed.  I got a Jerk Chicken wrap, and while the favors were OK, the chicken had a ton of little bones (see pic).

While I don't have high standard for a quick lunch downtown, not choking is one of them.

They used to cater at a place I used to work at, and that was always very good, otherwise I wouldn't bother reviewing!"
4,"Delicious! Excellent atmosphere! We got the sampler platter with etouffe, jambalaya, gumbo, and red beans and rice. Soooo good. My husband loves the BBQ spaghetti. They also have a great rewards program. Will definitely be back."
2,I ordered the bulgogi bibimbap and I didn't think it tasted that good.. :/ but it's a convenient place on campus and the environment is a bit nicer than Koreanna's if you are craving for Korean food.. but I thought Koreanna's food tasted better (and was also cheaper).
0,Waiting an hour for 2 chicken sandwiches and two orders of hashbrowns. This place needs new management. Play some music or something to get out of your negative attitudes.
4,I came here to have drinks with my homegirls and This was a cool spot to chill at.... the food is awesome and drinks (shots) were decent also!!!
4,"Just had  lunch , had the Ranch Chicken club, very nicely done. Two chicken breast on a seem like a home made bread slices with bacon, lettuce and ranch dressing. 

Going back again, plus do breakfast as well sometime this week"
0,"Usually this is a great place for sushi. However, we just waited over an hour for our sushi and crispy chicken. We were not refilled drinks during our wait. I had to walk up to the counter and ask for extra sauce when our food arrived because no one checked on us after we got our food either. I am really sad to say I will not be back. The staff did not seem to care. What a bummer."
4,These guys were thorough and gave a complete explanation of all shortcomings in our prospective new house. I would totally recommend tek inspections to my friends.
3,"A really fun time to spend when it is hot out and there is nothing else to do!  Actually, it was fun to show three kids how to bowl!  Lots of fun, and we'll go again."
1,"It's in the part of town where you would expect good Mexican food (and it can be found in this area, Pico de Gallo).  But Guillermo's just does not make the cut.

There menu consists of basic Mexican things (tacos, burritos) plus a small American section.  They have fish tacos on the menu insert but the fish tacos do not have crema.  How can you have a fish taco with no crema?

Service is fast, seating is almost always immediate and the waitresses are very attentive.

Butter seems to be the main ingredient in everything."
0,The staff was very rude and they had no customer service skills at all. I will definitely not stay here again
4,Amazing gluten free fried shrimp! So nice to have old fashioned fried seafood again. Check it out if your are in New Orleans.
0,How difficult it is to throw some ketchup and ranch into a bag ?! I know it is fast food and I don't have high expectations but god damn man. We are buying chicken rings and fries who eats them w/o condiments ffs. No need to roll eyes and get annoyed cuz I asked for couple lousy condiment.
4,"Zagol is Open!!!  And still great.  So glad the owner decided to reopen after being kicked out of her last place.  Feed is great- she personally flies the spices back from Ethiopia herself.  

Don't forget it's at the new McCarran location.  Get a veggie sampler plate. So yummy."
4,"Didn't expect something so nice in the Westport area. It is a lot of fun to eat while watching the actual baking process through the glass windows. The food is of course delicious, made with Companion breads. The combo of soup/salad/sandwich is $10 which is about $2 more than some of the other establishments. Totally worth it though."
0,"Covid is the least of their concerns. Family member went through ED and doctor straight up gave medication that patient was allergic to because she didn't believe he was allergic to it. Confronted her and told her she made a mistake 3 times and she would not admit her wrongdoing. Completely incompetent. If a score of less than one star were possible they would get it.  You are taking your life in your hands going to Brandywine. Find someone to drive you to Chester county, Paoli or Lancaster to avoid admission here."
1,This hotel was extremely overpriced. I'm guessing because of location however it is not worth the price. We got there and we didn't get any help with our bags. We booked a city view and we got the pool view. The place is very loud and old. We called the valet around 20 minutes before going to get our car and we still had to wait another 15 minutes once we went down to get our car. The room wasn't that clean and the beds were so uncomfortable. I do not recommend this hotel!!
3,Great comfort food. Quality service and great beer selection. Love the patio in the summers
3,"I would rather shop here then ever have to go to Walmart! This place is cleaner, faster and let's face it less weirdos!
I returned something's I had gotten for my bridal shower, I  did not have a receipt and the sales person gave me a gift card.
Great, now I can shop and get something I really need! Only draw back was she gave me a gift card of a baby buggy and told me she was not trying to jinks me those where all they had left!"
1,"No Beer, liquor license suspended!!!. We got the Maui Wowei which was good but lacked in a good amount of cheese.  I fully realized the lack of beer while ordering and instead got the pizza to go and stopped at Whole Foos to get refreshments before consuming this decent pie at hom. Wasn't worth the drive to SB from Isla Vista, next time I'm going to Giovanni's and bringing a pint glass."
3,Great comfortable place to have lunch. Good food good drinks. The sushi here is amazing. I love this place
3,Good breakfast.  Nothing  special you normal eggs and pancakes. If you looking for something fancy or different not the place to go but a solid breakfast place
3,"Solid Thai food at good prices. 

They have a very nice dinner special that will get you 3 courses at $14.95 on a weekend night.  The portions are big.  The red curry is a little watery, but nevertheless it is still comparable to other establishments in the Center City area.  The drunken noodles are good.  I'd love to say something snarky, absurd, or offensive about this establishment but I cannot.  It is simply a nice place with good food at reasonable prices that does not inspire me to write anything ridiculous.

Protip: Go for the chicken lemongrass soup instead of the salad."
0,"This place completely screwed me over. My insurance sent me a check because this place was over charging. This business stated that the money was supposed to go to them. Here I am, 4 years later. I have been paying through collections because I didn't want them to garnish my wages. Now they are, even though I never had to pay them to begin with. This place was supposed to help with my mental problems and now, years later, they cause more stress. They weren't even that great anyways."
1,Great music. Great atmosphere.but servers are not good. Very bad service. At least for a Tuesday. Wanted to stay but we felt like the servers was kicking us out.
4,"Brand new ice cream store! It's clean, overly staffed, & no customers. Great ice cream! I just tried the donut shaped like a hotdog bun with mint Oreo ice cream. Making it was interesting to watch. I tipped 2$ so it was over 7$. I will be back for sure!"
4,I'm so so so in love with the coffee and food here. The staff is super helpful at answering questions. They have such a variety of baked goods and they all look amazing.
3,"The only place I wanted to eat during our small tour of Philly-my go-to Crispy Hipcity Ranch Chik'n sandwich was a little dry, but the new Smokehouse Burger was wetter and delicious addition to the menu. There's ""secret"" seating in a door towards the back of this tiny location i.e. I was afraid to open the door because no one else was, but it leads to seating from another building in Philly-Astra G. describes it better than I do-see her review for more information."
4,We ordered their catering for 30 people last night and they did a winderful job. They even helped take the food to my car. The food was cooked and ready and fresh.
3,"Love this place, but would definitely NOT put it at $$.  Definitely a higher end and higher priced salon.  It normally costs me between $130 and $170 for a haircut and color.  On a good note, they do a wonderful job!"
4,"Loved this place! Came on a Sunday early afternoon and was seated immediately at a table right next to the water. I really enjoyed the coconut shrimp, complimentary bread with coconut butter, and my fried fish tacos were so delicious. I probably had 4 crab trap drinks, they were so good. Huge patio area and gorgeous water views, I will definitely be back"
1,"Not a good night for house of Tokyo. Don't know if they are skimping on food quality or what now but both the shrimp and lobster tasted funny and the lobster tasted really fishy. 

Not good. The filet was fine though."
4,We had a great experience.  The waiter was very friendly.  Food was wonderful.  It's a hidden gem worth trying.  We will go back soon.
3,We LOVED the Bonuts!  Amazing!  My sons had the Princess and the East Nasty. They recommend the sandwiches be made with chicken breast rather than chicken thighs. It made their biscuits wet. They didn't like that. My granddaughter had the kids ham and cheese she liked it no rave reviews. I had the cheese grits and shrimp no bacon and it was delicious. I would come back for sure when in town.
4,"We love Celebration in the Oaks! I went once as a little girl and was thrilled to see it was still taking place as an adult. Now, as a mother of 3 children we take the ride every year from Baton Rouge! Our annual family tradition is taking a family photo under the big oak tree. 
The hot chocolate is the best in the world!!"
3,"Interesting flavors and a fairly good selection. I had a sundae with chocolate and coconut mound ice cream with hot fudge and chopped nuts with whipped cream. It was pretty tasty. I think I would have enjoyed it a bit more if I had let the ice cream soften just a bit,  but next month the ice cream will be melting in the heat too quickly!

Service was friendly and fairly quick. 

I like the Creamery on Baltimore Pike in Springfield quite a bit more, but this was a good choice."
0,"I have done 5 projects with Stone Tech over the years;  some have been better than others but I was still considering them for our latest project.  This one is a double sink vanity that we are doing, so it is not a very large project.  I must say I was so disappointed with the changes at StoneTech.   The new people are not very helpful and they must have more business than they need because they were not interested in maintaining us as a customer.  I will never go back and I would not recommend them to anyone."
2,"The food here has been consistently good. I have come here a couple times on Christmas eve and their menu on those nights was very good.

Other experiences here have been middling. It's always incredibly busy (make a reservation, folks) and the prices are pretty high for what you get. The food is good, but not necessarily worth what they'll charge you for it.

I recommend their bread pudding. On a good night, it's probably the best thing they have."
0,"I was so excited to try these homemade pies that were still warm when I purchased them from the Solvang Farmers market.  once we arrived home quickly opened and sliced a piece. It really was the worst pie I've ever had. I was so disappointed. The crust was hard, had ZERO flavor and the apple filling was dry. I didn't even attempt to try the blackberry pie I also purchased. Both went in the trash as did the $20 I spent for them. Don't be deceived by how pretty they look. They're truly horrible."
1,"Why is it every time we come here it takes 25 minutes for 12 pieces of chicken. No drive-through, line up all the way outside. Seems totally discombobulated. Not sure what else to say. Prices are out of hand as well"
4,"Any place that has 10 shrimp boats that look like Forest Gumps docked out back is going to be great.   Guys were super helpful, we got the head on shrimp and some scallops. If you're looking for seafood and you're  in the area just go. It'll be  worth it for sure
Cash Only"
0,"Service is terrible! We waited to get seated and then they called us, seated us and then later came to the table and asked us to get up and leave because they made a mistake and called the wrong people to sit. Very unorganized! we got up feeling embarrassed as if we were the ones who had made the mistake! Not what I'm looking for in a dining experience!"
0,"Red beans here were okay. Not enough seasoning to be considered NOLA red beans but it's airport food and they're probably trying to cater to the majority of tourists, not people who are craving one last red beans fix on their way out of NOLA. Our server David was pretty non existent most of our time there and seemed put out anytime we needed anything."
4,Just called this store and handled everything over the phone with excellent customer service! I was late to order Mother's Day flowers and called 5 other stores that refused business. This store assured me a Saturday or Sunday delivery with confidence. Happy to support this small business! Thank you Accents by Michele!
4,"Was recommended by a relative to check out this place. We got the meat platter for 2, the 12 mix pierogies, and the hot apple struesel. It was all so delicious, but the pork pierogies were the standout! So good! Reasonably priced, and the staff was friendly! Will go here again before leaving town."
0,"Ehhh... I definitely wasn't impressed. Pedicure was only about a half hour and the technician didn't even massage my feet. She used hot stones but again kept everything on my legs. Place is clean and great selection of colors, but nothing outstanding. Probably won't go back. Not worth the $30."
2,"This was a great little set-up for a donwntown winery (Santa Barbara's oldest).  The tasting room had a circular bar with a view of a barrel room, wihch gave it a nice, cozy, and also kind of hip feel.  It is close by the beach, and sort of had a beach culture meets wine culture laidback feel to it.  The service was awesome and the staff were both knowledgeable about the area and frinedly, volunteering great info while pouring.  We didn't fall in love with any of the wines, but it was a great tasting experience."
4,"Only positive things to say about Anthoninos.  We ordered drinks and appetizers, appetizers came out very quick and they were busy (it was a Tuesday).  We had:  Toasted Ravioli, artichoke bottoms and calamari - all very good.  Pizza and salads also very good...would recommend to anyone and will be back."
4,Didn't know what to expect when I pulled up on the creamery. The actual building looks really cool! Inside looks like a log cabin which makes the ambiance stellar. The homemade ice cream was fantastic! Our server Justin George was the best server I've ever had. He was very kind and patient along with the rest of the staff. He was the one server that stuck out to us. That kind must deserve a raise of some kind. I will definitely be coming back along with all my friends.
3,Joe was in the kitchen last night and it shows. Everything was top notch. Reminded me of the old days at The Revere.
4,"Love this place! Great food! Great service! Lenny is the best server in Pasco County! Try the Monte Cristo, The Murph, The Traffic Jam,! I have enjoyed everything that I have ordered. Very attentive staff! Great ownership."
3,"Yum, yum, yum with an additional yum. Being from Southern California it's hard to find good Mexican food and regrettably before I leave this area I just found El Paisano. 

I ordered the beef chimichanga. It was perfect not too crunchy, and not soggy by the sauce. My husband had the burrito deluxe which was also good, just not as food as mine."
2,"As we entered the restaurant we noticed it is a small place of about 10 tables. Expect to wait if coming during dinner hours. Food comes out one plate at a time. I came with my wife right before it became busy. Decor is interesting and the jams are good, as they should be because you can expect to wait about 20 min at least during the early dinner hours. When our food came it looked decent a 3 out of 5. I had the Banana Fosters French toast and my wife the Angus Burger."
0,"Leased a brand new jeep grand cherokee... Within 2 years the tires proved defective... Although the tires should be replaced under warranty, I offered to pay some of the cost to replace... in my opinion, the service manager, John Zapp, is unprofessional and lacks integrity.  He would not honor the warranty, and was unwilling to work with me.  Definitely will not be leasing with this dealership in the future."
1,"The chicken wings were excellent, however the pork belly dish was nothing but a dried up pork chop,very disappointed! Also it was my daughter's birthday, which they knew about, reason for us being there. This was not even acknowledged except as we were leaving,the waitress said ""happy  birthday "",well thanks after a $220 bill!"
4,Wife loves this place even after 40 years of coming here. I agree it's fresh delicious food.
2,"A tiny place packed with lots and lots of glasses and bottles.  Not the most entertaining place, but it does contain a good amount of historical information on Absinthe in Europe and America. 

The best part is actually the store where you can purchase a wide array of absinthe accouterments, as well as French soaps, and other little bar/kitchen gadgets."
4,Food is delicious. Service was great. Atmosphere was family oriented and inviting. We had a party of 3 on a Sunday morning around 10am and there were TONS of people in the restaurant eating and waiting outside but the wait was only 15 minutes. I recommend this place as I love diners!
4,"This little place serves up  fantastic sushi !
The atmosphere is comfortable and the service is fast and friendly. 
The rolls were fantastic,  and huge. The rolls here are far larger than I'm use to at other places. 
And they tasted fabulous! 
Dont let this place slip by. It is worth a night out!"
4,Emily Danos was the best server I've ever had. She was very personable and kept our bottomless mimosas coming. I will definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone because of her!!!
3,"I was disappointed to discover this place was closed. 

Wifey and I had a great meal here a few months ago and we were going to make this place as a regular whenever we are in Reno. It had everything going for it, from the delicious dishes, friendly service, nice ambiance and authentic décor. 

Thai Nakorn was Thai food porn.

Too bad."
4,"TJ is awesome! He is a talented artist. He's did 2 of my tattoos this year & will be doing at least 2 more next year. Great with colors & shapes of special details. Gentle, patient, kind, & thorough. He takes the time to make sure that you follow the aftercare instructions & recommended AQUAPHOR, not A & D for my sensitive skin.
I got 2 other great tattoos in Agaru in 2008.
Great location on the 2nd level of the Trolley Square building.
Beautiful artwork & displays. Clean shop.
Congratulations on your engagement, TJ!"
1,"My last visit before the shutdown was mixed. The bartender was excellent. While enjoying happy hour I placed a to go order, which included two salmon salads. When I got home noticed there was no salmon on the salads. I called the restaurant and spoke to the  info@louiedemun.com  manager. He sounded like he did not believe me. I told him i did not live close to the restaurant otherwise I would come right back. He indicated the corporate office would handle the issues. I never heard from anyone."
1,"The size of the spicy crunch sushi roll circumference was a little over an inch. The fish in the middle was very scarce. I ordered 4 similar rolls and all of them were very skimpy. Flavor was ok but I have gone to several other sushi restaurants for comparison reasons and Haiku is definitely lacking in portion size. Purchase was a ""to go"" on 1/7/2021."
0,"Been there many times in the past. Never again!!! Gotten way,way too expensive...
Last time we ordered a caraft of sangria, $32.00. Didn't realize till bill came. Food now tastes like microwave food with small portions. Service always seems o.k. but the prices, what a rip-off."
2,"Sitar has somehow always managed to be my second favorite Indian restaurant in Nashville.  If it was consistent, I would probably make it my favorite.  I've had a pretty wide range of service and food there, from the best to pretty darn bad.  I decided to stay away from the service a couple of years ago and go buffet only, of which it's been pretty darn good, not quite great, but not bad.

The spicy level seems to run the gamut from Dave's Insanity down to ketchup.  Bring some kleenex to be safe."
0,I bought a loaf of their gluten free sandwich bread today. They had a half loaf displayed of each type. I believed these to be simply displays since they were literally rock hard... Dry enough to be shrinking and cracking. Imagine my surprise when I got home and found one of them in my bag. I can't even slice it with my serrated bread knife. Its inedible. I've bought excellent gluten free breads in the grocery store. Steer clear of this place.
0,7:35 on a Saturday night and they are out of pizza dough. What a let down. Like really? Get your shit together or don't advertise hours you have zero interest in meeting.
4,Ate there for the first time today. Food is authentic and fresh. Gyro proteins (both traditional and chicken) were quite good. Grape leaves and tzatziki were the real deal. Nice little samples of baklava were handed out were delicious. This location handled quite a lunchtime crowd very well. Staff people very efficient.
2,"Dale Mabry Sonic!  For when you need a breakfast burrito at 2pm and you also want to maybe see strippers go to the Subway across the street.  

Just like every other Sonic on the planet, the food is good enough, quick enough, and priced just fine.  This particular location has a drive-thru as well."
2,"Decor is beautiful.

Mexican poutine is delicious, rich in terms of cheese, sour cream etc., but nevertheless, delicious.

Fish tacos are good. The only minor complaint is that I wish the fish had more flavor/seasoning, but the slaw and sauce that accompany it is seriously tasty.

And last but not least, the margaritas...not the best, not the worst, but strong. It only takes 1-2 and I'm sure you'll be a bit more than buzzed. 

Downside, bathrooms are completely disgusting.
."
4,We have been coming to this bar for the last two years and the service is awesome and the drinks are out of this world. Highly recommend the black cherry lime crush!!
4,One of my favorite places in NOLA! There is usually a line but don't let that deter you because it moves pretty quickly and the food is worth it. My friend and I split the crawfish pies which were flaky and crisp with a little spice but not greasy. My friend got oysters on the half-shell and said they were good. We also got the sampler to share. It was enough for the two of us because we had to save room for booze and dessert.
4,"Brian is everything you want and need in a barber. He is professional and friendly, but most importantly precise and consistently delivers a great cut. Happy to have a great barber here in Mt. Juliet. This is one of the only barbershops that I think you can walk into, close your eyes, sit in any chair and walk out with a great haircut. All of the guys take pride in their work."
3,"Love victory!! The beers are awesome love dirtwolf. Staff is always good. They recently redid their menu. Not a fan of the new options. Also if you want fries instead of chips with your sandwich you have to actually buy a side of fries instead of a dollar up charge. 

Bbq chicken pizza is really good.

Wish they had regular soda and not organic."
1,Great staff but I received pre-made spicy tuna and it smelled. Not the real deal if they choose to do lazy mans sushi; the chef was embarrassed they pre make it too.
4,"My mom and are on a road trip from Las Vegas to New Jersey and we stopped into this McDonalds for a quick bite and also to figure out where we were!  Candace greeted me with a big smile and was really friendly and nice.  I know it was just a few minutes, but you made my day a little better.  Thank you!"
3,"(4.25) ~ Very good Park overall.  Seems to have EVERY Sport Field there is, including Basketball, Football, Volleyball, Softball, Soccer, etc.  There's also ponds, concerts and fireworks.  BONUS:  Conveniently located next to the Chesterbrook Neighborhoods & Shopping Center with multiple Parking Lots surrounding the Park."
4,"I love brunch! Expecially Eggs Benedict. My meal was perfect! The staff is very professional, attentive and friendly. The restaurant was clean and decorated in a calm relaxing fashion. There were 4 in our party and everyone was very satisfied with their meals and the service. Definately will be a frequent stop for us."
3,"So we live in the area, we decide on pizza, so we thought we would try out the Lamppost Pizza, we shared a large Pepperoni pizza and if was good, the crust was really cooked to almost burnt, my wife love the crust really crispy, so she really enjoyed the pizza, me not so much, to burnt for me.  the sauce seemed a little sweet for me.  The pepperoni was really good not greasy.  It was good pizza, we just next time to have the crust less crispy."
0,"This place is a microcosm of everything that's wrong with the US healthcare system.  Patients are herded like cattle through a frustrating, inefficient, and error prone registration and processing into a room with a doctor who intends to spend as little of his valuable time as possible suffering through your uneducated questions.  Be prepared to spend at least an hour in the waiting room on every visit, even when arriving on time for your appointment.  Arrogance, substandard care, and needless frustration."
4,"Best latte I've had in Edmonton!!! Has a unique nutty flavour, not too sweet not too bitter. Clean and amazing atmosphere. Croissant very nicely made. Can't wait to come again !!"
2,"I've eaten here  few times, this time around the food was just ok, there getting to many tourist when this happens quality drops. nothing good last forever, and money decides the outcome. but hey, all the people in America that eat shit foods on a daily basis will still love this place no mater how bad it gets. what did I find wrong? the French bread was a hoagie, not a true French bread. the roast beef tasted like pot roast not like roast beef. I know what they should taste like. I was raised in NOLA and used to get that roast beef sandwich regularly."
1,"Lunch buffet is gross and has not much variety. Chicken tikka masala is Campbell's tomato soup base. They replenish buffet by dumping bowls of refill into trays, not replacing the whole tray. Ambiance is pretty so it's a shame. It's basically Indian fast food."
4,"This place gets super busy early and it's small so it can seem a bit chaotic BUT the pizza was out of this world! Authentic, New York style. Service was good, wait was reasonable. Definitely recommend!!! My new go-to."
4,"Lenny was absolutely wonderful.  He was at my house within 24 hours of when I first called him, he patiently and expertly answered every single question I had for him, and he shocked me by finding areas of mold that were hidden in plain sight.  He was professional, knowledgeable, and thorough, with a warm sense of humor."
4,"Everyone was very polite, personable and helpful during our experience. We enjoyed the shuttle service as well as our weekend car rental. Thank you!"
0,"Got here for a vacation, waited 45 minutes just to check to get a car, and am now currently waiting over a hour and a half to get a car cause the line is so long (see attached photo for proof haha). The line wrapped around three times. You can see the last line to the left, the middle lane (where the photo was taken) and the first lane to the right. Good luck on burning vacation time ."
4,"Amazing people! Prompt, courteous and fantastically priced. They made throw pillows from my late father's clothing... the pillows looked incredible and I couldn't be happier. I will definitely be sending people their way and bringing all of my clothing there too!"
4,"Our basement flooded and Stu Reiben from Miller Restoration came out quickly and took control. Everyone who worked on our home was professional and went out of their way to find solutions to our
problems. Doramy worked hard under Stu and everything turned out
very well. Everything that could be saved was moved back into the area after it was repaired. I would definitely recommend them!"
2,While on vacation in the french quarter we decided to hang back and watch presentational debates instead of going out. While I was out looking for food and ran across this place. The place was about half full so I took at look at the menu and ordered burgers for my wife and myself. I got the infamous Peanut Butter Bacon Burger and it was absolutely delicious.
3,"On a whim....we ordered, online!  

Got the special, mix and match 3 for $16.99.    Ended up with a small smorgasbord. 

Medium pepperoni pizza, 12 inch meatball sub and 10 medium wings.  With tip, the order was around 23 bucks. 

The wings were deeeelish. I really enjoyed the sauce.  Vinegar based goodness.  The pizza was good.  I didn't have any of the the meatball sub but heard it was decent.  

Prices were good and we could order online.  We will order from here again!"
1,"It was okay. They had some special type of juice that I wanted to try (can't remember the name of it now). But when asked which dispenser had the juice there was just a general point over to where everything was. 

The service is a bit rushed. The food was okay. The price was okay. 
If I'm passing through Nashville again I think I'll just try a different resturant."
4,Stopped in Saturday before heading downtown. Watched Dave Cox then Ellen Rose and the Silver Threads - awesome. Nice bar with the back area being higher giving a good view of the stage. Quality of music is the best and bartender (Sara) took good care of us. Highly recommend.
4,"Best local pediatric dentist! So glad we found them! Patient and kind, they always take the time to really connect with you about your child's dental issues. Couldn't recommend them more highly."
3,I have been to Wasabi a few times because they have the best deal on sushi rolls snd always enjoy my meal. I came here Friday with my boyfriend who is getting more into sushi with each roll he tries and he enjoyed his experience. We got a few rolls to share and each one was equally delicious. I honestly could have tried all of the menu but that means I'll be back :) the servers are friendly and the service is fast. You never feel rushed and it's a relaxing atmosphere. I love finding a good sushi place that is so good and affordable.
3,"I didn't order food here. The interior was bit random. They got a shelves of beers in front. But as you walk all the way back and they had a refrigerated storage room stacked with more and rarer beers. They pretty much got the entire LA distributed beers covered.
Interesting things I noted is that they have a lot more selections of barleywines than in the Southwest/Pacific. Too bad barleywine is one of my least favorite styles."
4,"Best chicken wings period! Best blue cheese & ranch dressing period. Great value for a ton of food, Mark's Special. Kiddos love the claw machine where they actually get to win!!! Lots of fun family times had at Poor Richards!"
1,"The service was very slow. My burrito wasn't wrapped well. The rice was alittle hard. Overall, it wasn't the greatest experience."
4,"We tried the buffalo crawfish buns, fried tomatoes and lobster roll. All of it was absolutely fantastic! The fried tomatoes and lobster roll were our favorites. The 4 Hands Peacemaker beer was refreshing and had a great taste. Also had great service from Rusty! Highly recommend and can't wait to go back"
4,"This place has the best chicken tacos I have ever had!!!!! My new favorite place!!!! Great customer service, great food!"
4,You haven't lived until you've had the Bonuts and a breakfast sandwich on one of their biscuits. Waiting in line is worth it. Lots of shopping and coffee shops to visit while waiting (tag team with someone). A true Nashville staple!
4,This place is awesome! Food is absolutely delicious. You can tell that it is made in house daily and fresh. The people are super friendly and polite. The restaurant is clean and tidy. And it's crazy cheap! I would happily pay more for such good food and service. The only thing is that I wish they had little bit more variety or changed up the entrees from time to time. But not the rice noodles...they are my favorite!
3,"Went for lunch. Had lasagne-- very good dish. Wife had roast chicken salad but it had very little chicken in it -- why rated 4 stars -- she was still hungry when she finished her mostly salad dish. Good, attentive service. Cute place but need to order carefully."
4,"bomb ass food and the owner is one cool dude. Went here with my friends one day and had a good time hanging out there plus enjoying some great food. I think i ate everything on the menu: catfish, ribs, chicken, smoked sausage, and all the side dishes. All damn good.  I live in cali now and the bbq sucks out here so I am glad i got to go to this place when i was in tampa visiting my old friends."
4,"Love this place!  Locally sourced menu, full bar, fantastic brunch with the best Bloody Mary in town.  My drive is 25 mins to get here, and it's worth every second.  Great for a working lunch or date night."
4,Had a problem with a new MacBook Pro -would not charge.  Very good service and problem was solved.  I was very satisfied with the service.
4,"5 stars to amada in philly... shrimp/wild mushroom eggs, lemon ricotta pancakes, mimosa, cheese, and specialty drink w cava/gin/vodka/oj.... great servoce, great atmosphere... would definitely revisit"
3,"This is one of the better burger places in Nashville. It's located off 65 and Old hickory and is a part of an apartment complex. I really liked the vibe of the place and the service was really good.

They have a bunch of different burger options. Fancy and simple. And then  you choose your sides al la carte. Prices are decent and I'll be back!"
4,"Went to this place for the first time to ""study"" and was blown away. Atmosphere is great, and they're got outlet plus everywhere, even under the high-tables which was a highlight for me. Good selection of teas coffees and even had wines to lighten the study mood."
4,"This gallery has enough fine art and original paintings to be a small museum. After seeing the Takashi exhibit at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago, I decided to purchase two pieces. 

Sergio, our salesperson, was professional and helpful without being overly aggressive. Between my friends and I, we purchased five Takashi pieces. Sergio arranged for framing and white glove shipping. I couldn't be happier with my purchasing experience. I'll definitely be a lifelong customer. Whether you're looking to buy, or just appreciate beautiful artwork I strongly suggest stopping in while visiting New Orleans."
2,"I'd give more stars...rating only on the atmosphere. Came in for a few beers for happy hour and had a blast! Came back to a way different crowd! It was really crowded (I know it's Friday) but lots of screaming ""bros"" and young girls....I'd definitely recommend coming and leaving early unless you're into being pushed, screamed at and spilled on."
4,"Brought my car in to get a tire repaired after a nail got lodged in it. Drove in, had it done in about 20-25 minutes and was on my way at a good price. Quick and easy. Would go back again if I needed."
3,Great vibe and great bartender to my boy drew! Wish the buffalo pizza was spicer but it was good. Digged the alligator and duck sausage. Happy special is legit. Today 2 for 1! Can't beat that.
3,"It's said that this is the oldest continuously operating bar in the South of the United States. I stopped in here and ordered the Hurricane one of the most popular drinks served in New Orleans, which was good!

The bar has character to it.  It's kind of cool - a bit dark though.  Our waitress was very attentive.  When we stopped in - it was kind of slow and not much going on.  I'm just glad I was able to stop in and check it out. Had a good experience."
0,We ordered a simple 2 topping pizza following a Cardinals game. Was never given an estimated wait time during the ordering process and only found out in my email confirmation that it would take between 65-70 minutes. At the 1 hour 30 minute I  called to cancel because it was it just way too late to eat and they could have cared less I was cancelling. Based on that response I'd say it happens often. At this point I am concerned I will get charged and will then have to call and straighten it out
4,"Normally consistent and quick.  They use quality ingredients which sets them apart from run-of-the-mill pizza places, and the healthy menu options are plentiful.  Order today was slightly off but this was one time out of many 100% correct orders and just reminded me that I haven't written a review for them (still giving 5 stars)"
4,I love this little place. It's our go to donut spot.  The Donuts are delicious and fresh made. The owners are very friendly and honestly glad you stop in. You can't beat the price for a dozen donuts either!
0,"How can I order a cake for my mother's birthday when there is no menu online, no price list, and the only phone number on the website is for a ""consultation""? I don't need to be consulted about a cake. I just want to buy one, like I did for her last milestone birthday. I guess the cafe component of the bakery/cafe is more important these days. You lost me...which is sad."
3,"Came out with friends last night after capoeira class, in search of two things, the analgesic, hydrating effects of a cerveza, and a tasty taco. We found both and they were very healing. My favorite here is the shrimp with a Sol and lime. Next time I'll try the veggie taco, that looks good too."
0,"We had an appointment for a passport and waited over 20 minutes past our appointment time for them to come help us. The office was not busy and they knew we were here.  They told us to be here 10 minutes early, and we were. But now we wait for them for 20? Unprofessional and rude."
4,"Fantastic place to find new and especially VINTAGE toys! Fair prices and great people! They always have cool stuff coming in, especially if you're into Star Wars, Transformers, GI Joe's and a TON of Legos!"
4,Cool bar and restaurant!! Enjoyed the oysters and the live music. Very cool decor also! This place is a must!
0,I bring my Pilot in for a Check Engine light.  They call me back say the battery needs replacing.  It started fine this cold morning.  They say it won't start now.  Drove it in there fine.  They started it and moved it to a repair bay.  But now it won't crank.  This gives a me a warm and fuzzy feeling about Burns...NOT!
4,"Extremely tasty and all around good food, texture , flavor, temperature, portions. Staff is very nice and extra accommodating!!! Love"
3,Great beer selection. We always choose to order flights so we can sample multiple beers. They only serve beer but you're able to go next door to a wine place and bring glasses of wine back to the bar. The bar has bands playing almost every night in the courtyard. Great place to hang out and hear some good music.
0,"This is an extremely poorly run hotel. The staff are not wearing masks that cover noses. I am here and still waiting for towels to be delivered that I ordered over 6 hours ago. There is only ice available on one floor. The valet are nice, but they will not allow you to park your car- which seems ridiculous given we are in a global pandemic. The restaurant is not properly spaced. I will not stay here again."
1,"My friend whose local took me here.. idk why she likes it so much here to be honest. The pretzel wasn't anything special at all.. kinda dry and boring. She also insisted I try a ""boost slushee"" since it's something you can only get in that area and god it was disgusting. It was so sweet and it didn't look appealing at all."
2,Everyone I went with enjoyed their food. I got the snow crab legs. They were the worst I have ever had I wouldn't recommend!!
4,"Super nice people. The breakfast sandwich with avocados is delicious! If you're a bit weird like me, they keep Sriarcha behind the counter so feel free to spice it up in the mornings ;)"
0,"Food is okay, though nothing to write home about, but atmosphere is horrendously indigestion-inducing due to ridiculously loud and obnoxious punk rock, which is always playing no matter the time of day. It's a particularly strange choice, given the otherwise mellow and kid-friendly vibe.  Such a shame, as we really wanted this to be our regular neighborhood spot, but we've given this place so many chances and it's the same audio garbage every time. Not going back anymore. We'll make the longer trek to Soup Kitchen or Kraftwork instead."
2,"Yeah, it's a casino in Reno but I can't say anything bad about this place.  We used airline miles to pay for the room and we were literally only there for 6 hours.  Long enough for my wife to fly in at 11:30 that night, and to wake up for our ride to Mammoth the next morning at the crack of dawn.  

Our room was actually pretty nice.  We were only there briefly but the room was clean and the bed was comfortable.  I'd stay here again in Reno on another visit.   

Incredible value for the money and the location is great."
4,"Best King Cake & Banh Mi you will ever find, everything else is also amazing. Plenty of variety - baked goods, and traditional vietnamese dishes. Worth the trip from wherever."
4,"Wings were some of the best I've ever had, and the hot chicken sandwich was  and amazingly tasty! Will definitely be back!"
4,Very kind and welcoming staff. Worked on my infection that could have been life threatening immediately. They performed the surgery quick and effectively. This place deserves a lot more credit for there hard work!
4,"This place is pretty damn good, excellent menu, very good food, and very reasonable prices.  Definitely the best mexican food in the area."
3,Had the pepperoni pizza here.  Being from jersey I was a little hesitant about pizza in Arizona.  The pizza here is really good.   Service is friendly and great.   Nice place
3,"Our go to local Chinese restaurant, quick and great service. The food is tasty love the sing a por me fun! Crab rangoon is delicious. Very good prices."
4,Liver parfait. Enough said. LOVE this place! Not to mention the decor and wait staff are fabulous.
3,"One of the better happy hours in the area.  They have $3 small plates and $5 cocktails.  We had a burger, a flatbread pizza and a fried shimp appetizer with a martini all for under 20 bucks."
1,I am pretty sure this place changed ownership and the food is completely different. The food used to be amazing. There's no way I'll be going back there again.  Serious disappointment.
4,Bison burgers are our main reason for going to Ted's.  They are generously sized with a variety of toppings.  Onion rings make a terrific accompaniment.  Service was excellent.
4,"We are on a road trip; stopped for dinner. We had appetizers, excellent burnt beef tips was Awsome. The ribs were tasty & great & the brisket was a lil fatty but Delish. I wish they would come to florida~ Five Stars loved the atmosphere & the manager stopped by to ask if all was good & the young man was very pleasant."
0,"I went in today to get a sandwich around 12. Sandwich makers were nice but I got the worst customer service from Cora!!! absolutely rude!! If your having a bad day don't go to work. I didn't get greeted, she was pushing me to buy more than just a sandwich, was rude cause I didn't want to. Threw my sandwich on the counter instead of handing it to me while my hand was reaching for the bag... please put happy workers to work!!!!"
4,"This is one of our must-eat places when we are in Palm Harbor. They serve both breakfast and lunch (and flavored mimosas!). The service is excellent, the management team is super helpful, and the food is delicious!! They even managed to seat a family of 12 outdoors without any issues!  I highly recommend!"
2,"The quality of the food is not consistent. Most of the time the noodles are VERY salty. Avoid noodles although they have ""noodle"" in their name. Try ""Buns&Dumpling"" section on the menu, it is way better."
4,I love their pizza. Consistently good for years. Wish they had delivery.. Best kept secret!!!!
2,"The food was good, but the service was not so hot.  Our group of four was passed around between servers, all of which were forgetful and super slow.  I'd recommend trying Rosalita's...just not on a weekend."
2,It's not a bad place to head out to after a day of golf.  This microbrewery is down the road from the Sandpiper golf course.  The selection of beers was good.  I ordered a pitcher of IPA and it was quiet tasty.  The food selection was also good.  I had the Santa Barbara fish tacos with a caesar salad.  The ono fish in the tacos was delicious. The service was slow and the ambience was on the loud side.
4,"Hands down my favorite salsa in the world! 
I live nowhere near here but do make special trips just to go down there and eat. Always a great meal and always friendly folks taking care of you. A real family owned restaurant."
4,Thank you (William and staff) for helping us when our car wasnt starting.  Was nice how quickly the hotel was willing and able to help us.  We were on the way to the airport and the car didnt start - just barely made our flight.  So thank you!
2,"Tried this place in Carmel out tonight for their Indy tenderloin week special. Establishment is definitely dated but it's clean and kept up nicely. Our server was really friendly and prompt. 

Their tenderloins which we both got- one grilled and one breaded are HUGE! They were both good nothing super special in my opinion but still enjoyable. We also each got a side of fries which were also good. 

Not sure if I will end up back here but I wouldn't be mad if I did."
4,OMG this place was awesome. Server was very attentive to our needs. Explained everything we questioned. My brother ordered the COFFEE and was thoroughly impressed. The fried cheese experience was awesome. The bread that was served was extremely soft and tasty. I loved the idea of eating out on the patio. All in all this is a definite revisit when we return.
4,I have been going here since I was a kid and I have never had one cavity. My family all goes to Jay and have had nothing but good things to say about his work. Most resaonably priced dentist around woth top quality customer service.
0,"Please someone open a better (which isn't asking for much) taqueria in NW Reno it would crush cause the King (el Rey) is dead. 
When did chips and salsa merit charging 4.04$.....especially after you order dinner for 3. 

Service=terrible 
Cleanliness=see above

I could go into further detail but it won't change a thing because many have voiced the same complaints. 

More power to the king I suppose"
4,Loved this sandwich shop! We happened to stop by when we were in town and it turned out to be one of the highlights of our trip. Our sandwiches (turkey tom sans turkey and the reuben) were amazing. I love that it is a family business and that they use quality ingredients and much of it is from scratch - hard to find these days and the owner we talked to was lovely. This place is a gem and we will definitely be back when we are in town.
4,Before going to Philly my friend said vedge was one of the best vegan places he's been to and it isn't to be missed.  I will never ever doubt his judgement based solely on that assessment. It was. It is. They changed how I view rutabega. Every bite was amazing. There wasn't one item that I thought was just okay... Every bite better than the last. Seriously I'm counting the days until I can come back to Philly to eat here again. I'm jealous you dear reader might get there before me!
4,Always a pleasure going to this GNC location. Employees are friendly and always help me find what I'm looking for and thoroughly answer my questions.
3,"I was in town for business meetings staying in French Quarter. I met a friend who just moved to New Orleans from Columbus for breakfast at Surrey's. I arrived early and the friendly manager informed me of the history of the restaurant and its multiple locations. When my friend arrived we sat inside, and had a delicious breakfast, memorable for the incredibly flavorful and fresh ingredients. A great experience outside the French Quarter."
4,I'm a regular customer for a reason.  Always friendly and a great massage. The price is right.
0,"The one star is solely based on convenient  location. 

The store stinks-- literally. It smells like a dirty litter box. The smell in the entrance is the worst part but the smell permeates the store. 

The produce is questionable. The store itself has nothing that would make you go running back. For that matter i only have gone here in a pinch. It is worth the drive to Wegmans every time."
0,"Took my car here to use a Groupon for an oil change, they did not even change my oil filter and my was low on oil only 1,000 miles after having the oil change, so who knows if they even changed the oil  Would not recommend using Midas, I will never take my car to one again."
4,Wonderful a experience!! The staff was nice and very helpful. It is also a mall in walking distance.
4,Our family loves their donuts!  Stoped by many times and they are always fresh!!been going here for seven years. They never disappoint!
4,"I have been coming to this place for the past four years and they are absolutely wonderful. Their service is great, but my favorite part comes after they make your nails look pretty....you get a back/neck massage for a few minutes. It's heavenly. The ladies and men who work here are always so professional and nice."
3,I really enjoy the bar setting as well as take out. My fav is the red curry chicken. If you want to catch a sports game the bar has a good flat screen. Lindsey the bar tender is super sweet and gave great customer service.
0,"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! 
Honestly the worst salon I've ever been to. Rude service and I'm sure they over charged me for a service ($25 for a full set when the advertised price is $18!!) I was displeased with in the first place. I went in once to get my brows done and the man was very rough with the wax and made my brows very uneven. Vive has disappointed me on several occasions and I will NOT be back. I advise other people seeking good service to look elsewhere!"
0,Waited 30 minutes to be seated our buzzer never went off and others were seated first. Tried sitting at the bar and no one helped us either. Family time is better spent elsewhere
1,"Came here to return something I purchased online. As always, there are few people that work in the store so I end up waiting for service in order to buy my clothing and leave. Staff is friendly but its frustrating to wait so long to buy or return something. Other Old Navy stores are much faster than this store."
1,"Great service, awesome bartender, but the food was boring and bland. Now mind you, I don't mind boring and bland food when I get a fast food burger, but if I'm gonna drop 14 dollars on a patty between two pieces of bread it should be somewhat memorable. The fries were soggy too. I won't get into the irony of trying to corporatize heavy metal, I'll simply opt for spending my money at a local spot like working mans friend next time."
3,"I have gone here 4 times so far. The last was on 4/4/20, I received a fill and green gel polish. Then Covid-19 hit. I assumed I'd have to soak off my set since they are still closed, but at 4 weeks in I still had no broken nails. I filed off the gel polish, filed down the length and buffed the grow out and painted. Today is 6 weeks and 1 day, still no broken nails! Very impressed with the quality of this set!"
3,Lovely local used book shop with plenty to browse. The books are well organized by genre and hosts a friendly cat upstairs. I believe they ship if needed. Be sure to allow time to browse the titles.
4,"Simply put, delicious fresh food. An extensive menu of salads, sandwiches, appetizers and burgers. Including some vegan options. Tried the Hawaiian burger and let me tell you it's the burger like no other! I simply can't have enough of this place, the atmosphere is so peaceful and love the outdoor seating area or you can even take your food and eat it at the beach that is just steps away."
0,"Had a 1000am appointment. Got there at 9:47 and was greeted well. They said they would get to it right away. An hour later I looked to see if my car was done, and noticed it was still there. I confronted the desk and they said they would get to it right away. It's now been 1.5 hours and they are working on it finally. Avoid this place."
4,"Love! The chicken is wonderful, even when my mama had a small issue with an order, they gave her a special coupon! Such sweet people!"
0,"Went for a dinner tonight with three friends.  Staff and Chef were very rude. We thought it was BYOB, honest mistake.  The worker said "" should have looked it up"" in a very rude tone.   We wouldn't mind paying for wine, but could not accept the treatment.    Do not recommend!"
4,"First time customers from out of town. My son said ""Dad, this is the best Italian ice I've ever had!"" I think I would agree. And excellent service at this location!"
3,Best Chinese food within 10 miles of Elkins Park. The restaurant is very clean and the food is outstanding.
4,So pumped Tiki Docks is opening in the neighborhood! Love what they have done with the space! Looking forward to receiving my soft opening invite!! Best of luck to y'all - positive reviews only!
4,"Food was good, service was outstanding. Some wines reasonably priced, Live music and hip atmosphere. Would definitely come back.  Yukon gold whipped potatoes  melt in your mouth."
1,"For some reason this Old Navy always disappoints me, which sucks since it's the closest one to me.
The store is always a wreck, they're always out of stock of sizes 4-12, and they always seem understaffed. This store is only good for the basics like plain colored tank tops and the 2 for $5 flip flops."
4,Amazing food. True italian. Just like the hill. Waiter was great. Never went thirsty either.
4,"We decided that we wanted something a little nicer for an evening out. Despite the lower ratings that I read, we went ahead and tried this location. Everything was above what we expected. It was a busy time on Sat evening and the parking lot was full. They said about 20 min wait time, it was less than 10. Service was quick and the food delicious. I would recommend this place for a good meal experience."
4,"In love with this place!!  The staff really make the experience. I love being greeted by a friendly welcoming face. This place has that down! Nick greeted us with a huge smile making us feel like we where at home from the second the door opened. 

The menu is pretty simple filled with tons of southern delights. I ordered the fish chips yummy!  They offered me a sample of their famous gumbo AMAZING. 

They are decorated in a traditional bayou style restaurant with blues music playing in the background. 

Miss Patsy did it right with this place!!!"
3,Checked out this place while in Philly for work. It's small but worth the visit. The food was GOOD! Fresh and well prepared. We were not disappointed and if you like looking at cute dogs it's a win win.
4,"My aunt and I have been coming here for several years. She always goes to Tammy and I go to Jackie. All of that girls are fantastic even Lee. They have a bunch of colors to choose from including gel polishes, dip powder and regular polishes. Definitely recommend this place. I would however recommend you do get an appointment because some days they are very busy and you will be waiting if you walk in."
1,"Had an 8pm reservation, but arrived a little less than 10 minutes late.  We had not been seated by 8.45 and gave up.  When we arrived, there was a somewhat agitated man who was with a party of 6, that had been waiting to be seated - they had been waiting a while, and it took another 30 mins for them to be seated.  From our interactions with the hostesses, we concluded that, at least on this Saturday evening,  this restaurant did not take reservations seriously.  Cannot comment on the service or food - it smelled good though."
3,A bit pricey but to be expected on this side of town. The food is very good and the people who work there are always friendly. I do wish they had better specials and happy hour deals.
3,Stopped here for a late lunch. Parking was a challenge to locate for a outta towner.  The margarita was delicious. We split an order of big-ass nachos -- huge amount and really good. We'll go back. Staff great.

0,don't know who this Jesse is but I wasn't impressed with Necole
4,Best pizza in Tucson! I've tried lots of pizza and I recommend Grandma Tony's Pizza . Salad is good too
1,I came in because everybody was talking about their food on fb. I had turkey wings mac/ cheese and lima beans. Omg what a waist of money. No seasoning. People in line said the best thing there was the chicken and frys. I said i dont eat anythig fried but fish. I wont be back
1,"OK service but the meal wasn't worth what I paid for it. Believe it or not, the sports bar across the street is MUCH better - go there."
0,"When I went here the short Asian lady who took my order was screaming at the people in the back in Chinese, it was nuts. Food is expensive and takes forever."
4,"Love shopping here.  Great selections, great staff, especially Theresa up front at self check-out and Clair in seafood.  Nice people, nice clean store."
3,"Minus one star because the door was locked and I had to keep trying to twist the handle until the tour guide opened the door.

Not the tour we expected (we were thinking it was going to be a self guided tour) but our guide was friendly and informative. $10 per person for a tour for about 1 hour, nobody else was with us not sure if that's normal but good bang for your buck and you get to see hand crafted dolls and figurines."
2,Ran out of Barbacoa and had to wait approximately 5 minutes and manager offered the meal free!!! for the wait and inconvenience. Praises to their customer service and not allowing any frustration during my short lunch break.
4,"We had a rehearsal dinner for 30 people.  We could not have been happier with the food, service and decor!  We had planned to use the awesome patio for part of the event, but the weather did not cooperate and everything was moved indoors. We had many compliments on the food and drinks from the sangria to the ravioli, crispy chicken and bourbon barbecued pork loin to the mini desserts which ended the meal.  Coming from Baltimore we did not know the cafe and depended on previous reviews.  Everything in our experience from the first email contact to the end was an absolute pleasure."
3,"The food was great for the most part and you leave full and entertained just like you should at any Teppanyaki spot.

My only gripe is their hibachi noodles have a weird taste to them. Almost a soapy taste, but everything else is good so you don't really need the noodles."
4,"Great lunch special. I typically do the cacio e Pepe - which has never disappointed. Same with  bucatini. That said, the absolute must of the whole experience is the sea salt chocolate chip cookie for desert. It's killer."
3,"This is a hole in the wall type of place, decor isn't the best,  but the food is really good.. They only take cash"
3,"I love how they've added Kyle's kitchen to their menu options.  Can never go wrong with anything on the menu. I try to get something different every time I go, but I am a sucker for the turkey, bacon, avocado sandwich."
4,I started taking my two persian cats to Dr. Stanley when my previous vet moved to another town.    She was a hard act to follow but I have been very pleased with Dr. Stanley and his staff.    They take a genuine interest in my kitties and are compassionate and professional.    Dr. Stanley is knowledgeable and I know he will do what is best for them.    I highly recommend Yellow Dog Vet Clinic.
0,"Pharmacy is totally incompetent...friendly but clueless. Boyfriend and I have continual problems with prescriptions, etc."
2,"My husband and I walked over from our apartments and I enjoyed the wonderful breakfast! Great service too! The bacon was cooked perfectly, the biscuits nice and soft! Eggs were a little cool! I enjoyed it, my husband didn't!"
4,"The best eyebrow service in the Westchase area. I've been coming to Rubyz for the past year to get my eyebrows threaded, and I love it. My eyebrows are always on point and nicely shaped."
4,I personally have always had a great experience here. The staff is always friendly and always gets my food and coffee out in a fast and friendly manner. Mike always greets me with a smile on his face. This is the only Dunkin I go to in the Indianapolis area from now on.
3,Great food. Guinness and black. This place is the most fun on St Patrick's day.  That's when I have the most fun.  They had free glasses when you buy a Guinness  and you could pay to have them engraved. I have a Guinness glass with my name on it.  Great songs. Waitstaff knowledgeable about the menu.
0,I am a woman so they thought they could rip me off. I went in for a battery for my command start. They told me that the batteries are not replaceable and I needed a new remote costing 220.00. Went home googled the battery for the remote and it was 14 dollars. They won't return my money. Women look out
4,"Did my first escape room with GTFO, and it was everything I hoped for & more.  Staff were super friendly & helpful, made us feel comfy while we waited, and the room itself was great -- challenging & fun.  Only super small think -- they had complimentary hot chocolate mix (yay!) but hot water was only available from a Keurig that produced non-clear water, presumably left over coffee residue.  A small, cordless kettle would have made the experience flawless, instead of just awesome :)"
2,Great food and drinks. God awful inattentive service  that makes an otherwise pleasant experience. Won't be back.
4,"Decided to try this place for lunch. The salsa given with the chips has the perfect amount of heat. Very good. I decided to have the #20 Quesadilla Chicken Fajitas - it's 1 big fajita with grilled veggies, cheese, guacamole, sour cream and tomatoes. It was so good I couldn't stop eating it. Service was fast and attentive. I will come back here when I return to this area. Two thumbs up!"
3,"Don't think your coming to catch a glimpse of Channing Tatum. According to the staff he very rarely makes an appearance there. They said it's been about a year since he was there last. The decor inside is decent, meaning clean and nice. staff was really friendly, and it was dead inside. So super easy to get a table. Shrimp Po Boy was decent. The coleslaw was a God Awful mayonnaise soup with some cabbage. The jambalaya was REALLY, REALLY Good."
4,Dive bar with exceptional food. We sat outside by heat lamps. Service was attentive yet unpretentious. Not many drink options but interesting beer choices. Duck was delicious. Squash pierogies - wow. Awesome. So good. Expensive but worth it.
2,We went here for drinks and apps after work one night. They were out of many items. Which was disappointing. The drinks we got were just ok and the apps were pretty tasty. You can't go wrong with fries! The service was slow and they weren't that busy. We did have nice outdoor seating though. However parking was a pain.
0,"So this was my first time coming here and it will definitely be my last. I ordered a beef filet cooked medium, it came out like a hockey puck. The remake then came out mooing. The restaurant was very empty and the service was still extremely slow. I had such high hopes and was so terribly disappointed that went home hungry."
0,"I really wasn't impressed with this store. The selection is inadequate, the staff weren't friendly, the size of most the bulk products is not realistic for residential consumers. I'd rather go to Costco, membership and all."
2,The food was very good just the wait was at least an hour. The Service & the food was wonderful.......The atmosphere was great for good conversation....Check it out when you have time to spare!
4,This is one of my favorite Float Center in the area because they do 75 minute flow to start a 60 minute floats. You can buy three floats for $99 anytime and that's what I do. It's one of the easiest and greatest places that I enjoy floating at and I am so relaxed when I'm done I feel like I'm in heaven. I recommend this Float Center to anybody who wants to have a very quiet 75 minutes of bliss!
0,Bland. No flavor. And for Chinese food it was warm when I got it home. I live 1/2 mile from them. I ask for spicy fried rice. No spice at all
3,"During my stay I had access to the exec lounge which made my stay great. Breakfast, snacks, drinks and evening hor d'oeurves really go a long way. Although the hotel is older, it was clean. I liked the robe and slippers touch. The breakfast is very basic. Extremely basic in fact but it beats nothing."
3,Great Family business had a party of five people everyone had burgers and I picked the fried chicken . The burgers cooked to perfection and fries r the BOMB !!!! Fried Chicken was delicious and came with two heaping sides. The waiter was Really Awesome never had to ask to refill drinks he was on top of the Game wish I remembered his name. Overall fantastic nite out a must go !!!!
4,"I think the OFallon Cinema has made a lot of great improvements over the years. I remember when it was just Wehrenberg theaters and since Marcus cinema has moved in the improvements have been incredible. Amazing seating, SuperScreen, and UltraScreen as a few upgrades! Additionally the ability to reserve seats is such a dream. This is my exclusive theater for sure."
1,"This place is crap. Stumbling distance to the hotel, so, gotta give it two stars. I see the as dysentery emporium."
4,This is the closest location to my house and it just so happens to be the best! I visit this location quite frequently for breakfast or dinner. Everyone is very friendly and the service is FAST. The food and drinks are always great. It was so cute on Valentine's Day to receive a heart shaped chicken biscuit! How adorable!
3,This store is good has a lot of products pretty decent selection of Mexican products. The only down part is that if you go in around noon you will have to wait in line for a long time.  I suggest go first thing in the am.
4,Very quick and friendly service.  I had a slow leak and tired of the light coming on I did some research and found this shop.  Bill and his guys are the go to for all things tire!  Bill came out and within two minutes found the leak and within 15 minutes of my arrival I was back on the road.  My bill for the repair was under $20!  Great shop and a great experience.  It's a little run down but I will take that any day for the prices and the quality of service.
4,"Starting with garlic toast, ending with dessert- this is one of our favorites always.  Very relaxed and pleasant atmosphere, quick with drink refills and fountain drinks are always mixed correctly. We usually go for lunch so no opinion on alcoholic options.  I love the brisket on the menu now and the grits, but honestly its the desserts that make even the picky 4 year old come back!"
3,"Had dinner here last night.  Everything tasted great. They have a nice selection of Tapenades and what I would consider Mediterranean influenced choices which are quite good. This was our second time here, the waiter remembered us and sat us at the same table. Felt very welcomed. The only issue was our entrees came out lukewarm. They offered to reheat but I was afraid that would kill the quality. They very graciously gave us dessert at no charge. The experience was a good one. We will be back."
3,"Great location, our waiter was very attentive. Conch fritters and fried calamari were very good.  Grouper sandwich, fried shrimp nicely done.  Walnut crusted grouper salad was disappointing, fish was undercooked and the walnut coating was awful."
4,Best place to get good priced drinks and a great atmosphere and great service. They always treat you like it's your home. I highly recommend this establishment.
4,"This place is on my list as a must visit for a great breakfast (which my oldest son requires).  I had the cochon and salmon benedicts, while he had the pancake trio.  I enjoyed the breakfast margaritas - and the charming accent of the bartender...she sounded like a 1940's Brooklyn Lady, but is from the NOLA area.  Try them out."
4,This is an amazingly welcomed addition to Northern Liberties.  The team does a great job taking care of the clients.  My nails have never looked better and I have never felt as appreciated as a customer.  Very accommodating and reasonably priced!  Great job ladies!
3,"We want to check out the new Panda Express, Compare to other Panda Express place is clean and the food is fresh and tasty. But position size is small. They gave a lot of rice but others are little. They need to increase the position size."
2,"Tamales are great here.. Service is even better.... but the sides here are gross. The chips I had last night were kinda on the stale side.. the black beans had too much pepper in them.. the chicken in their chicken/bean soup was not tender and way oversalted, the side of rice was ""crispy"" and dried out. I think I will just stick with their amazing tamales and stay clear of their sides. 

p.s my favorite tamale has to be their blue corn tamale (vegan) yummmmmyyy"
3,"Great place, helpful staff, very good and interesting collection.  Supports local music by setting up musicians for in house promotional performances. In addition to vinyl they have some nice gifts for audiophiles.  Parking can be a bit of a challenge right out in front but you can always find parking within a block or so if it isn't a Saturday night."
4,"This place is a party!!! The decor instantly brightens up your day! The food is very authentic, delicious and perfectly priced. Not to mention, they have some of the best salsa I've EVER tasted (it's complimentary too!) The service was excellent and the staff was super friendly. I don't need to waste my time anymore traveling to Philly to find good Mexican food. Don't be fooled just because this place is in a shopping mall. It's a literal hidden gem. Take all your friends here, I bet they'll have a great time!"
4,"Very beautiful park! Had my wedding here last August by the house and the fountain overlooking the bluffs. The house was beautiful in the pictures. You do not get to go inside the house, it's outside only. Loved the views of the river. Can't say much about the rest of the park since we were mainly at this part but it looked like it had a cute playground and a nice lake."
2,"Terrible attitude by the receptionist. Not genuine, warm friendly greeting and then when I was leaving, realized I left my new handmade mask in the room. She looked, but said it was not in the laundry or room. I asked her to make a note so when it is found, they could contact me. I described it. No note was made. So I asked again and she said,""I know what paisley is and teal."" BTW, it is orange with no teal... her attitude was most unpleasant.
The facial however was FABULOUS!"
4,Anna and Paul are the best! I have been doing the Japanese treatment with them for about 5 years now and I am super happy. I don't have to worry about the humidity in Florida once I get my treatment done. I have wavy hair so my treatment will last about a year. I highly recommend them!
3,"This restaurant is fantastic! 

Don't let the word ""pub"" scare you when it comes to food.

 Wonderful choices, excellently prepared with great service. Friendly faces, great bar (and bartenders), comfortable seating, really delicious food and dessert. 

The only problem is that it has limited seating and can get quite crowded with substantial wait times during peak dinner hours... but it is definitely worth the wait."
0,"HORRIBLE pharmacy service. I've been calling for 2 days trying to get through and each time have been on hold for no less than 45 minutes with no one coming on the line. When I do get through, I plan to transfer my prescription to another location. Unacceptable customer service!"
4,"An annual tradition celebrating beer, baseball and bikes! Lead by the mayor of Indy and escorted by IMPD, all riders enjoyed a safe commute from Sun King to Victory Field!"
4,"My wife and I came here for dinner and thoroughly enjoyed it. The food was amazing. And the service was great. Our waitress, Mel and our bartender Ella were awesome and seemed really happy that we were there and made us feel that way."
3,"This was a good airport restaurant ! Let's face it, airport food is not good. I was pleasantly surprised when I ordered the chicken tenders and a side of fries. Both were hot and fresh. They had live music and the musicians were good. My only complaint would be for the restaurant to clean/wipe off the menus."
1,Prices are outrageous. Appetizer stuffed plablano pepper was very tasty but only 1/2 or piece of pepper. Margarita had no alcohol just tasted like pineapple juice and cost 9.75. Ordered a burrito with a choice of pork chizoro on menu for 13.75 bill came out as 18.50. And it was so bland. This was lunch. Will not be back to eat there.
0,"I've stopped going here.  They are always chincy on the veggies (I always have to tell them twice for each veggie that I want more) and heavy on the condiments (even when I ask for ""only a little"").  I've had people spit when they talk while making my sandwich - at which point I told them nevermind and left.  They've never been outright rude to me but they just pretty much don't seem to care. 

Go to the publix across the street and get fresh subs that are better tasting with better service."
3,One of my fav place to get a quick bite. I ask for only little sauce cause it can be too sweet
4,"Tina did a great job on my nails. She listened and asked questions to make sure she understood what I wanted. She took her time and seems like a very sweet person. A pleasant experience, beautiful nails, I will be back. I went in because I noticed it's close to my new place and I needed a fill. The staff seems happy and friendly and like they like each other which I think is always nice!"
4,Best clam chowder ever! Service was quick and efficient as well! Killer views and free parking but you have to fight for it!
2,"It wasn't that bad! I was scared to go from reading the reviews until I received a buy one entree get one free coupon. True true the menu is WAY too long. Seriously, it's scary long but our server was great and the food was good. My husband had the rattlesnake pasta, my son the pizza, and I had the chicken enchiladas. I think the food is a little overpriced for the overall quality of the taste but for a short drive from home it's worth a stop every couple of months."
2,"Lovely outdoor patio in a charming courtyard would have delighted our group were it not that we were seated next to a plastic shrouded bank of air conditioning units.  Cocktail Royal Dauphine was wonderful.  Salmon disappointed.  Skirt steak, garlic soup were spot on.  Kitchen was slow - 40 minute pause between salad and entree."
4,"Amazing food, lots of options, friendly staff! Wish I could eat here every day! The Mac n cheese is unreal! I also had the Ulmec and the Sunrise smoothie. Both were incredibly good. If you're in DE, it's definitely worth checking out."
4,"Amazing biscuits n' gravy. 

On another note, the last review complaining about having to have an ID to enter... That is every hospitals policy. They must know who is inside doing what. Would you want to go into an unsecured hospital? No you wouldn't."
3,"Took my Lexus in for a Synthetic oil change and had a great experience. I dropped it off and the check-in was very quick with the tech and left him with my key and my mobile number. In a couple of hours, he called me back saying it was all done. 

When I came back to pick up my car, he remembered my name and had everything in front of him ready to check me out. A swipe of my card and I was on my way.

Fast, efficient, and friendly. I'll definitely be going back."
0,"Worst hotel! The check in guy was not very nice at all, I think he forgot he was in the customer service business. And I am writing this review at 10:16 am cause on the Starwood preferred guest floor (fifth floor, kinda the Penthouse) the cleaning woman was yelling in the hallway at 8:14 am and I can't go back to sleep!!! Also usually get the free breakfast coups but I guess they stopped that. Don't do what we did stay at a different hotel! Regretting this hotel decision.  The Hilton across the street is really nice."
4,"What a little gem. I wish I had discovered this place sooner. I ordered the spicy tofu soup and it was delicious, I also got the jap chae to go. The meal came with rice and your traditional sides. The owner and his wife are affordable!!"
4,"If you like German food, make sure you check this out .   Loved the beer Keller.   The old German charm is beautiful.   We had drinks and appetizers.   Pretzel bites were soft and served with a tangy cheese sauce.   The sausage and cheese platter was a great assortment.   Braunschweiger was spreadable on rye toasts.  So much flavor.  Also red pepper hummus with soft pita chips.  I will return"
3,I like the area. I came when it was nice and breezy out and I sat on the bench with my glasses looking at people and pets passing by. It was nice to see families come out with their kids. Overall it is a nice here of the city.
4,Brandi B is awesome!!! I will definitely be coming back! She was very attentive and very knowledgeable about everything here. She deserve a raise.
1,Was expecting much more. I ordered the choose your own 3 meal with 2 tacos and a Chile relleno and guacamole . B I received American style tacos with soggy hard shells. My side of rice and beans was salty while the guacamole couldn't have had any salt in it. I also didn't get chips and salsa on the side or any side salsa for my meal. Wouldn't ever order again.
4,"My family and I shared a meal here today. Immaculate, kind were the safe, and, delicious! Everyone went out of their way to keep us safe and well fed. Plus, there offerings of items to go? Incredible! Highly recommended"
3,"Amazing service and a great little place. I ordered that spaghetti and meatball dish you see in the photos.  While it wasn't pipping hot, for a reason I'm sure, it was delicious and filling.  The salad was great and the wine on point."
4,"Excellant food! Amazing atmosphere! Clean appearance, friendly staff, LIVE MUSIC! Wonderful experience! Food was incredible, the most homemade tasting food I have ever had! I can't wait to come back!"
3,"I am a crazy sugar addict - there's literally nothing I think is ""too sweet."" Sugar Philly is my savior as a student surviving on a meal plan, I just pop over in the afternoon and grab couple of their REALLY LARGE macarons. The Milk and Honey is probably my favorite but honestly all the flavors are great, and the owner is fun to chat with."
0,"So Bland. Where is the seasoning?

We got the Mysore Masala Dosa, the Medhu Vada, Gobi Manchurian and the Paneer Kati Rolls. Everything except the Vada were so under seasoned and Bland..I hate wasting food but I had no choice but to throw out 80% of the food we ordered. Waste of 30 Dollars :("
4,"I absolutely loved my stay at this Hilton location. I arrived late on a Friday and the hotel staff quickly checked me in. The bellhop was super helpful and kind. When I got to the room, I was quite pleased to see the huge room, very clean, amazing bathroom and even better view. The hotel is located right on the water so there were a lot of things to do, places to visit and places to get food. It's also located in walking distance from South Street which has plenty of restaurant and night life options. This location will be my go to any time I visit Philadelphia."
0,"I came in to pick up an item on Saturday. 45 minutes later still siting being assured I'll be helped in just a moment.  

Crappy branch. 

That is all."
0,"Poor service and poor food. Ordered the breakfast burritos and a coffee with ice water. Never got a refill, which I requested, on the coffee or the ice water and the coffee was served in a cold cup. The eggs in the breakfast burritos were over cooked. Wait staff acted like I wasn't even sitting there. The entire meal cost just about $16. It was a waste of money."
2,Sub par steaks and no type of ventilation for the smoke. Service was terrible and we had a party of 8... I've never been asked to serve myself nor clear my own dishes while dining in at any establishment. Save your money and go elsewhere.
2,"I give 4 stars for the banh mi, 3 stars for the pho. The banh mi has a crusty bread and good amount of filling. It is one of only a few places that has a ""traditional"" banh mi, which I love more than the fusion types. The pho is not bad for the price and a mall setting. The broth is a little salty but there was a good amount of meat compared to noodles."
4,Knowledgeable staff who always encourage us to ask questions. My husband is avid photographer and I always need to ask their help when trying to purchase something from his wish list. He likes the availability of the large lens rental for special events. Great store in a fabulous location. If I'm considering a purchase and the item will be on sale they are honest and let me know if I need to wait for a week or two. That is very appreciated.
0,"Beware!  Don't trust them!  I called because my car wouldn't start.  They told me it would be a two hour wait.  I made the mistake of believing them.  4 hours later I tried calling them.  No answer.  I left a message.  No response.  They abandoned me completely.
It's the next day.  They never called back.  Don't use this horrible company!!!"
2,I had the fried catfish and my girlfriend had the nachos the nachos were really good! Yet the catfish didn't have a taste to it so I really didn't enjoy it but the waiter was really cool so I'll be coming again jus not for the catfish lol
4,"I don't often shop at Whole Foods but stopped here on my way back down to Indy. Their meat counter was nearly full, which was surprisingly nice since I went on this past Sunday evening. They also have Kettle & Fire bone broth, which is awesome and I usually have to order it online. Prices were high but that's what you get at Whole Foods."
0,"On top of my horrible experience at this place the other night with the owner they served us bad meat b/c I got food poisoning as well. 

There are plenty of better options in Broad Ripple. Don't waste your money at this place. Don't let the owner's reply to my initial review fool you. He was an immature uptight jerk. He has no idea how to treat customers."
4,"I was in NOLA in 2011, visited Mahony's and was impressed with the service and food then.  Fast forward to 2018...went back to Mahony's.  Even better than 7 years ago.  Excellent, quick, friendly service and reasonable prices. Had The Pork & Slaw P.O. Boy Sandwich.  It was piled high with meat, and crammed with tangy, tasty Cole slaw, tomato slices and pickles.  Left feeling full beyond belief.  Will definitely be a ""must go to"" place on my next visit!"
0,"Not worth the money. It's $21 per person, they only have 2 rooms of art on display. Nothing interesting about it. I wouldn't waste my money if I were you. The price is the most ridiculous part, plus $5 for parking!"
2,"Didn't ride the swamp thing however we had a few good drinks here . Sat outside in the open, big backyard and based in the beautiful  sun . Also watched and cheered on  my big strong friend battle and break the record on the KnockOut boxing machine . Couldn't have had a better afternoon .
 
They have Rumplemintz here ....... Take a shot, trust me that's all you need to kick off your day or night."
4,Their brunch selection was delicious! They had a huge selection and of course took our requests for add-ins without a problem. I had the California Omelet with their freshly-squeezed lemonade. Wait time there was about 5-10 minutes for our food. Will definitely visit again.
1,I don't get it!  Why is Vedge such a hit??  I've been here for both happy hour and dinner and was underwhelmed both times.  The food is overpriced for not being very special.  The one thing I'll give it is that the interior is very cool.
3,"Was introduced to this eatery, and well what can I say, great place, their dishes are fairly healthy, which is something I like. This place a good variety of dishes, and their servings are pretty decent to the price. one of their best features is that it offers outdoor sitting, and although it is right Broadway, you can carry on a conversation without having to yell at the other person. 
Great date experience!!!"
2,"Beautiful place, very bright with natural lighting.

The service was good and just everything was bright and pretty. The food was beautifully presented too, but man........ It was bland as shit. I thought I had covid because I couldn't taste anything. It needed some salt, extremely under seasoned.

The fries weren't even salted, the cheese made up for the lack of salt. Just make sure the food is well seasoned the place would be a 5/5"
4,"It's much cheaper than alternatives, which helps a lot for log trips. Yes, you need to shuttle from the airport, but the shuttle comes quick if you call, the service is great, and I've had great cars each time (often get a free upgrade to mid size). Great great value."
0,"This used to be one of my favorite spots. Recently I went back for the usual stomach- ache, gut buster burrito. They must have just gotten new menus, and along with that came a price increase for everything they have. I was fine with that until my burrito and refrained beans came out cold. My girlfriend and I both ordered full meals that were brought out in less than three minutes. Not sure what has changed there but I've lost interest."
3,"Very nice place, came in and got the Lox&CreamCheese bagel to go and it was very good, most places give to much cream cheese and this gave the perfect ratio of cream cheese to Lox and tomatoes. The staff were friendly and the food was great! Will definitely go back again."
4,The food was delicious! Loved the crab dip and chop chop salad. Our waiter was awesome! I'll definitely be back!
4,"I just love their pizza and for me it's the best in town!  Lots of cheese that's stringy as you take a slice; love the sauce too....  One thing though, it is a little expensive and I'd be there more if it wasn't, but it's worth it.....  Nice atmosphere and pleasant people!"
4,"I'm all about the Happy Hour here. Buy one, get one for a quarter?! And that queso with chorizo. They have a great atmosphere for dancing too... My favorites are reggae nights on Wednesdays and going to see Art (bartender) on college nights on Thursday. He always gives the best bottle service."
0,"Terrible. Used to love pizza hut. This is nothing like it used to be. I have given them 2 chances, I'm done. I have only ordered pan pizzas. It's their staple, how do they mess it up? We literally couldn't finish a slice. Save your money."
4,Excellent rates and very professional service.  This guy rocks!  I HIGHLY recommend him.
4,Awesome meal. A must stop if looking for lunch near John's Pass - Madeira Beach. Large portions. All of us brought food home.
0,Yikes...had high hopes and was severely disappointed. Bread pudding tasted like sweetened omelletes with pieces of dry bread. Red velvet cupcakes was so dense and although the flavor was ok the texture was not. As someone who has Celiac's and has tried many dedicated gluten free bakeries this has hands down been the worst I've visited. Their jalapeno cheese bread was also equally tasteless and has pretty much no jalapenos...what a waste of money. If you're in town visiting move on...
2,"The place definitely has a ""chain"" feel to it, but the Char grilled Oysters were the best I have ever had.  I also ordered the Crawfish Po-Boy, which was okay, but not great.  I would definitely return for the oysters!!"
4,"This place is excellent. We visit here at least once every 2 weeks. We have had all the pastas, a bunch of the salads, soups, and many of the pizzas all real good. The pastas and salads are excellent!"
3,"So mad At myself for not taking a pix of the beet salad with a fried goat cheese ball added for $2.
Holy Cow.  It was a drive for us but so glad we went.  (It felt safe - we went before dinner rush and they were trying to keep windows open as long as possible)"
4,"Awesome service every time I've been here, and tried the brunch for the first time today. The corned beef and hash browns are AMAZING as are the peach-spiked mimosas! Visit Shelly and Teddy and you won't be disappointed."
2,"I think this place is ok! I like the hole in the wall feel but I felt like the poboy was pretty average. The French bread immediately got very soggy and it felt like the sandwich was just thrown together. It was  very cold inside and the fans were on anyways. If you're here might as well try the shrimp poboy, the beef one needed more flavor."
4,"Love this sushi. It's good quality and it's fresh. I work in downtown West Chester, and this is my go-to lunch spot.

Arguably the best part of Bon Bon Sushi is the value. You can get 3 sushi rolls for $13! And there are plenty of options to choose from for those 3 rolls. You really can't beat that."
4,"So much fun today! My husband and I sat in the park for a good hour. Free wifi, a little cafe, and fountains abound! A great place to just sit and enjoy the sights and sounds of the city. Being a local, I appreciate how much effort the city made to change that side of City Hall. Now it's a really nice area, perfect for a quick stroll, a run through the fountains, or a quick bite to eat with wifi."
0,Don't understand the hype about this place. Only good thing was the coffee shake. Fries are over fried. Burger no flavor.
3,"Great view, great food, great music! Outdoor seating was perfect! The BBQ shrimp and cheese grits were delicious as were the boiled crawfish! The bananas foster was amazing!"
4,"Oh my goodness, if I lived in Nashville I'd be dropping every paycheck here. The selection of plants was impressive, but what struck me more were the beautiful pots and ceramic pieces, and other fun gardening nick-knacks. I was in such a good mood being around all those healthy plants and pretty colors. One of my favorite places we stopped in Nashville!"
3,"Why did you change the milk chocolate chunk????
The non existent ""chunks"" just make it gritty  
Please bring back the chunky chocolate!!!"
3,I think they make best pizza anywhere. My favorite is the rusty special Also they have very polite and on time delivery people. The only thing from being five star is the higher than normal price. But great pizza.
3,"Had lunch on a Tuesday with two friends. Not at all crowded. Wait staff were very friendly and attentive.Very good Brisket sandwich (the Brisket is chopped), Very good brisket Tacos. Side of Beans very good, O.K. traditional Cole Slaw. Despite the good reviews that I'd read, the Ribs were a disappointment. Yes, the meat fell off the bone but the meat was very dry. I would not order again."
1,"This place used to be go-to for a really nice chIcken Cobb salad, no longer. There may have been one total piece of romaine in this salad. The cucumbers were slimy with centers cut out, so they knew they weren't good. I would have been embarrassed to serve this salad."
4,"My husband and I were hungry but we didn't want to eat too much either as we were rushing to catch our flight. We split the pastrami sandwich and we ordered fries too. The sandwich was very good! Too good for airport food. We also shared a drink. It was grapefruit juice with basil and rum, which was tasty too! They forgot about our fries and they came after we almost finished the drink and sandwich, that's why I took one star off, but I gave them 5 stars again because they bartender was nice with me and my crabby husband lol"
4,"Been here many times in the last couple months. One of my favorite restaurants in town! Delicious Brats and really incredible imported beers. My favorite is the St. Bernandus....wow so yummy! No place like this in Santa Barbara. Excellent food, great service, and a wonderful atmosphere and environment. Nothing like enjoying a Brat and a beer at the Brat Haus."
2,"Food is great at first, but later will become too greasy and salty. They charge mandatory service fee at 18%. The server also did not tell us the soup for side dish has different price mark when he recommended them."
4,A perennial favorite. I used to have an office upstairs and I never tired of it.
1,"Nice atmosphere, good location, not too crowded.  The thing was my drink was REALLY watered down.  I ordered a vodka soda that was on special and I could not taste ANYTHING but seltzer.  A few of my friends also celebrated with a round of shots and they noticed the same thing. Pity."
1,"Loved the atmosphere but the food was awful. Paid $4 for ""nachos"" that were just tortilla chips and shredded cheese. The burgers made my husband and myself sick almost immediately."
0,Do not stay here!! They were having Trump supporters from the Tampa rally. I was told we dont like you people so there. WHAT??? I think they are disgusting and their property is disgusting. Stay far away!!!
0,"This place is going down the hill. The dosa is cold every time, bland. They now give the lentil soup (sambar) for free but its like having flavored hot water as there is no taste. 

The rice that comes with the chef special was semi raw/uncooked."
4,"Amazing food and service! Highly recommend the calamari, steak empanadas, the filet and the LOBSTER ravioli!!! For dessert the cheesecake and the chocolate cake were great as well. Server was amazing as well. Overall 10/10!! Can't wait to come back :)"
2,"Pretty good lunch special for the value, but the decor was strange and the food, while solid, was unspectacular. There are better Thai places in the area (Thai Singha Take-Out, for example), but this is a good option if you're looking for a nice cheap d sit-down lunch or dinner."
4,"We loved it!  Better than Pappy's in our opinion.  Their sides are made with as much care as their meat.  That's the way to do it, folks.  Will be back. :D"
2,"Just stopped by JJ Bootleggers for a quick lunch break. They have a $9 lighting lunch special that includes a few options with fries and a drink. I went with a burger. The burger was pretty good but very small, to the point that I could've eaten two had I been a bit more hungry. Fries were reminiscent of McDonalds. They honestly might have been the same fries. The bartender was really friendly and talkative which made for a good experience."
0,Just got tacos and was highly disappointed . This place use to have killer tacos . Def won't be back . Wish the taco stand right by the light was open
4,Great place to meet with friends and maybe find someone. They can make pretty much any drink you want. It's a dive-but a great dive. I would recommend it for anything needed.
4,Awesome Assistant Manager. Go to Rebecca. She can do everything. She has helped me and I do almost all my banking directly through her.
4,We were celebrating our anniversary and decided to try Firebirds. We had never eaten here before. I looked online and discovered they had a coupon if you sign up for emails . Always appreciate coupons. Our meal was wonderful. I had the salmon and hubby had the sirloin. Delicious . We also had dessert. The chocolate cake was to die for! We will be back!
1,The only good think there is the coffee the rest is okay food. And I don't really recommend that place it's so god dam expensive.
2,"Have been here a couple of times, once for drinks and once for dinner. Drinks and cocktails are great, good beer list. 

For our dinner I had ordered the Whiskey 51 burger medium, and it was served to me well done with burnt crispy edges... Gross! My dad had gotten the siracha shrimp flatbread and they brought him out completley the wrong one until our waiter walked over and said wait a second....

Food was average, but love the atmosphere. Hoping this place can do better next time!"
4,"Stopped here with the boo after the Kevin Hart show...this food is seriously some of the freshest and tastiest late night food we've had in a while. I had the Singlewide Burger, he had the chicken tender basket...you can't go wrong with either option, in my opinion."
4,I always go there for lunch and get the chicken liver meal. They give pretty big portions on the liver for the price.  The only side I don't really care for is the rice since it was mushy.
2,"Perhaps New Orleans is not the beat place to open a chain sandwich shop... The best thing I can say about Jimmy John's is that it is fast. When it first opened here, I feel like that compliment could be coupled with ""good product"" but it's 100% gone downhill. Chips are good though. Of all the local JJ's, I will say this is the best service I've ever experienced."
4,"they were super nice from the time i called, to the time i left.  Molly did my lashes and she was awesome, explained everything.  I had a slight issue (missunderstanding with the membership and the manager (devon i believe) called me that night) got that cleared up.  Love my lashes, cant believe i waited so long.  Hope they last , i am on day three!!!!"
4,"So good! We finished everything we ordered...including the sides. Our favorite is the fresh raw oysters and their signature crab. Mussels, clam chowder and grouper fish are also great."
4,"Friendly service, delicious food. Causal enough to take our toddler with us to dine. Please try the cheese naan and Rogan Josh (lamb). Yum - so good!"
3,"An empty bar on a Sunday night is great for me, as I was able to commander to two TVs to show the Angels-Red Sox Game 3 playoff game. Yeungling was also 2.50, so I was a happy camper.

Good service, but then again the place was empty..but still I liked hanging out there to catch a game. I hope to catch Game 4 there."
0,"I am writing specifically about the Banana Republic at the West Edmonton Mall...HIRE NEW STAFF cause the ones you have now absolutely SUCK. No joke, I have been to Banana Republic in NYC, SF, Montreal, Calgary and Toronto  and now unfortunately the closest one to me is at the WEM. I WILL NEVER go back there again. The staff were UNHELPFUL, RUDE and utterly DISMISSIVE. I had well over $400.00 worth of items in my dressing room, which I would have likely purchased at least %75 percent of, if I would have had some help with sizing and colors."
4,I been to the this movie theater a few times nows and think this theater has a great location. The theater itself is very nostalgic and gives you the old time movie theater feel. My girlfriend always come to this theater when we see an independent film!

0,"I have given this Place a shot twice and after the first time last winter  swore I'd never return ... as I am
Loyal to another salon ... But this closer to my home .. My friend and I came late morning on a Saturday to
Dirty conditions bugs flying around , rude nail techs and a lot
Of
Waiting .... Never ever again and asked for
A
Gel manicure and got charged for one but only received a a polish change .,,"
0,Website said walk-ins welcome got in line and hostess said no walkins very disappointing. With seats open completely ridiculous!!!!
4,We felt good ordering from here especially after seeing how prompt and reliable they were with assuring the safety of the staff and customers during the COVID-19 pandemic.  We will be ordering from here again!
3,"I am in love with the ambience in this restaurant. Really clean, quite, bright, and cozy. If I could eat breakfast food every meal of the day I would. And this place serves breakfast all day. Everything tastes very clean and the food always come out still warm. I've tried a build your own sandwich and their healthy turkey omelette so far. Their eggs benedict looks so good, I'll have to try it next time I'm there."
2,People actually ask if you need help at this location vs S Virginia.
4,Gorgeous facility with beautiful grounds!
0,The changes to the menu and original recipes are not for the better. They changed the Ninja Salad. I can't believe it. I used to dream about that little salad and now it's gone. The salad I had today wasn't even close. What a disappointment. I will not be back.
0,Just wanted to update my last review- construction is still going on every day of the week (even Sunday). Noise is unbearable and impossible to sleep in on weekends. Imagine an extremely loud alarm clock going off 12 hours a day. My lease is up next month and I would not stay here if someone paid me.
4,"Ok, came back and had sizzling steak and shrimp.   It was outstanding!  I'm stuffed.   We had the lettuce wraps and it was outstanding,  as well.   The staff is friendly and the service is great.   I guess  I will be coming back again."
4,"WOW I had such an engaging experience while sitting at the bar watching the game. The bartender Bryan Poet suggested an in house porter, which was excellent (definitely will have it again). He also guided me to he Ahi Salad which was excellent well!! Great Job, Pinellas BJ... A+"
0,"This place is so unorganized.  Every time one of our staff go place an order for the office, it is wrong. Then they want to argue with you saying that's not what you said.  I suggest you write it all down and show them the paper. We used to go several times a week. WE ARE DONE!!"
1,"The veggie bag is so delish! 
Everything else was just too oily and needed more flavor than butter or oil."
4,First time in and absolutely loved the experience! Our server was so sweet! Our food was amazing! Ans last our drink we're the cherry on top! They were so festive with their displays and the flavor was just amazing! Will for sure be back
3,"There's a reason Patachou has become an Indy staple. The food is fresh, well made, and tasty. Service is attentive without being overbearing. This location is no different. Everything you've come to expect from Patachou."
3,"I love their chicken love mein, only problem is that they have no drinks to order. It's kinda a bummer."
1,"Dear Canyon's Crown, 

I wanted so badly to like your restaurant as Tucson lacks a proper pub.

But, my medium-well burger was an over done piece of rubber, and one of your waitresses insisted on arguing with my wife.

The rest of the food was unremarkable.

I would like to give you another shot, but I might have trouble convincing my wife."
4,"This restaurant is amazing. I wanted to try everything so I got a Lamb Noodle Soup (thin noodles) and Ox Tail Soup.

The Lamb Noodle was awesome. The broth was flavorful and the lamb was not gamey at all. The Ox Tail was good as well... Although it was hard to eat since the Ox tail was chopped and not in it's original form.

It's really cool watching the man in the back hand make the noodles. 

Excellent service."
4,"I have been here many times. The food is fantastic, margaritas are great, and service is good!"
4,"Once you get past the casino and get into the restaurant, you will be totally satisfied with the ambiance, the service and the food.  We love ""Michael"", he really knows his wines.  The wines are fair market and have a good variety.  
Their prime rib is out of this world, it is better than other overpriced steakhouses.   And if you like blue cheese dressing, you are really missing out.  
Although they have a full menu with great shrimp, scallop and pasta dishes, their ""prime"" beef is outstanding.  
Can't wait to go back,"
0,Do these people even have a clue as to what they are supposed to be doing?! I am going to go with..Nooo..
4,"We're happy to be able to support our local restaurants again and Jane is a great local spot to come to! The chicken piccata is definitely a great choice, you can't go wrong with this entree. We had to try the famous coconut cake and it did not disappoint! I can't wait to go back again. #socialdistancedinner"
4,"This is my first time having Korean food in Philadelphia, and I will say that it was very good. I got the stone pit bibimbap with a Diet Coke. For this bibimbap, it had edamame and snap peas inside which I found to be very interesting. Although the pot itself wasn't hot enough to burn the rice, the flavors made up for this. The restaurant itself was nice and clean, and the staff was very kind and attentive. Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant if you want classic Korean food."
0,"ABSOLUTE worst Steak and Shake ever. Workers are all standing around doing nothing, and there's over a 45 minute wait for take out. Don't go there unless you want a horrific and terrible experience"
4,I had a rabbit and I liked it ! I had chicken gizzards that rivaled my grandmother's.Duck! Who eats duck on a Thursday night ! I did !  The shared plates I had with the other members in my parties were wonderful. We bought 3 bottles of wine  for 12 people and 1 bottle of port for dessert. But you know what the best part about this place ?The people that  work here.they really care about their job of making sure you enjoy  your meal. Very helpful suggestion and they explain the menu  with good recommendations
1,"It's ok. A little pricey for the portions. If you want true Philly-style grub, head over to Philly Phlava in Tampa. 

Also have to take issue with one of their delivery drivers. Red Dodge pickup, this guy drove like an a**hole tailgating me through the parking lot. Sorry you couldn't do 50 in a pedestrian zone buddy. If I represented a business I would think twice about pissing people off on the road and potentially causing an accident, which is what would've happened if I had stopped a tiny bit short."
2,The quality of their ice cream tops any brand you can buy in any super market and they have not downsized their 64 oz container as the other brands have.But I do have one complaint.Their chocolate razberry  with almond flavor has most of the razberry on top rather than evenly distributed throughout the container.It is a little deceptive.
4,"The food was creatively designed, well prepared and delicious. The prices created good value for your dollar."
4,I am not a big fan of hotel food (seems to be quite expensive and never well served) but this place is not expensive and food is good. Friendly staff and a nice cozy environment.
1,"We sat in the patio on Easter Sunday. I ordered a sugar free Redbull vodka. Bartender said it was $1 extra for call vodka. I asked for Tito's Vodka, but when she poured, it was Skol Vodka. She made a point of charging $1 extra for the Tito's, when I watched her pour Skol. $1 not a big deal, but..."
4,very nice staff! and the food is amazing! i'm happy to say that i'm a repeat customer
4,I wonder why this place is rated 4.1 when it should be 5. I had the best burger in the whole entire word. The bacon burger was so juicy and the fries were the best. Waitress was so nice to me.
4,"Great hole in the wall. Authentic quality food for a great price. Loved the lamb and al pastor. The guy there was really nice and friendly, and I get the feeling he really takes pride in his cooking and takes care of his guests. If I lived in the area, this would be one of my regular spots."
4,"Love this place. Crispy wings, great pizza and best staff around. You should give them a try and I'm sure you wont be disappointed. Get a bucket of wings to go and I'm sure your party will be a hit."
3,"This place was a nice, mellow spot off the madness that calls itself the French Quarter: the adjacent bar has a sign off Iberville advertising cheap Skittle shots, but the drunks seldom venture inside.

The food itself was decent: it's possible to order from both Powdered Sugar and the adjacent bar (but avoid the bar food--nothing special...). The food was fresh-tastin', and we visited twice while in the area. If you're looking for a mellow place with a little class, give this place a try..."
2,"Interesting concept and over all Okay. My first visit I wanted to keep it very simple to see what would happen before I pushed it. 

non-fat yogurt, pineapple flavor, with real pineapple. That's it.

Everything was fine, just really lacking in flavor."
4,"Hershel's provided deli trays for my Super Bowl party and they were truly outstanding and a great value.  Not only did we get the trays but there were so many extras as well such as the brisket (some of the best I ever had), Dr. Brown's soda, and a cookie tray.  The meats, salads and pickles were all delicious.  I ordered food for 30 but felt like I had enough for 75.

We will definitely be ordering food from them again!"
4,Amazing Israeli cuisine! My family and I have been going to Judah for several years now and are never disappointed. I always make sure I get the Shawarma--it's so tender and well cooked! The Israeli salad is always fresh and flavorful. Service is always friendly!
3,"Fun atmosphere. Good menu choices. Large variety of staple American foods.  Shakes, burgers, fries, salads, and more to satisfy everyone's appetite. Sad to hear the Orlando Portillo's is not opening now.   listening to them call out the order numbers is very entertaining."
4,"I've been going to Gadabout for about 10 years or so, and have always had an excellent experience.  I recently decided to switch stylists and Gadabout locations, and I tried RACHEL at Kolb and Sunrise.  Wow.  I have honestly never had a better color, and the cut is very clean.  She got my hair looking healthy again.  I've been struggling to find the right balance of blonde in my hair, and she gave me partial highlights and I now have perfect Barbie hair, which is always my goal."
3,They do a good job at a reasonable price. I would Definitely recommend giving them a try.
4,Leah was nothing short of amazing! Her hospitality was on point. I wish every Waffle house had her as an employee. She made my first expirence 100% unforgetable. Thank you. Leah! I had a wonderful time.
4,"We spent Girl's Night Out here this week! The music kept us dancing in our seats, the service was great and the food was delish! All six of us ordered something different, and each raved about their meal. We love to support local, especially in these crazy times, and will certainly be back soon! (Ps- As a German-American, I can also attest to their authenticity in flavor!)"
1,Nice facility but body shop service is poor. They didn't even come out to show me the work done.
0,You are better off going to a ruby Tuesdays or a different generic American food chain. Not worth the money.
0,"Wow...only one way to describe this place. Rude, rude and yes rude. Not sure if I would want any service done here. Was just trying to schedule an appointment and talked to the rudest person. I don't need to pay for rudeness. Many other great salons here in Reno. Not wasting my time here."
2,Deep dish is like what I ate in Chicago. Delmar flavor is good. I don't like kirkwood one.
2,Alley is the best.......drinks ok strippers learn to hustle.....overall not impressed.
0,"The front desk staff is extremely rude and typically not even the least bit helpful. If you are treated / prescribed to a mood altering prescription and you run out of prescriptions, good luck getting one before seeing the doctor which can sometimes be months away. They will not let you speak to your doctor in between visits and a terrible with communicating the status of a message left for your doctor. The doctor told me ""yeah it's typical withdrawal symptoms when you go with out your medicine but it's not as bad or as dangerous as drug or alcohol withdrawal.."" I would not recommend this group to anyone."
4,"Today I consider I've been here enough times to write a review. And it's a very positive one. 

The coffee here is excellent, truly outstanding. In fact we splurged on a bag of special special to enjoy at home. I particularly enjoy their Americano blend. Same with the variety of tea - hot and iced. 

Of particular note, a renovation is well underway. This way they can put their stamp on everything and erase all traces of the previous coffee shop. 

Last point, service is always professional and very friendly."
1,"Bottom line: Ok southern cooking, but there are better places out there.

Pros: Live music, delicious sweet potato pancakes with pulled pork on top (breakfast), and thick cut bacon (breakfast).

Cons: Fried chicken and biscuits aren't memorable, green beans taste canned, and regular pancakes are average at best.

I had high expectations based on the high reviews, but was sorely disappointed."
3,"I've been to Pure Eatery a few times now, and while I usually love whatever I get, I wasn't a fan of the Dijon Tarragon Chicken Salad sandwich and I think our server/ possibly the  owner was having an off day because I missed her usually warm personality. 

Despite this trip's shortcoming, the restaurant is beautiful and I love that they support local artists and companies. The food is really good and have a nice variety of options."
3,"Besides the eerie security measures this place is a sure shot for the best soul food in Germantown. The portions are huge and good for the price. Me and my girlfriend ordered the tilapia platter and split it as if it was two meals. The food was banginnnn! Seasoning was just right, it was like my mom made it, but better. The sweet potato and collard greens were sent from heaven and the fried tilapia was on point. Definitely will be coming back."
1,"The craft beer selection was great and the bartender was knowledgeable about the beers.  The service was ok, but not great.  We ordered the new pretzels and were very disappointed.  The beer cheese dip was good, but the pretzels were premade, fried, greasy pretzel balls.  Not at all what was described or expected.  Because of that, we didn't order any other food.  As it turns out, we had one beer and the pretzels and left.  We were hoping for better, but it just is not there yet."
2,"We just had a $113 lunch - no alcohol! Bison nachos had very little meat, Bison brisket was fair but mostly mashed potatoes and sliced unseasoned carrots, a very dry chicken sandwich, and a burger. It would have been a bust but the  strawberry shortcake was absolutely delicious. We won't be going back."
1,"Not a good experience. The pizza is okay. Nothing special about it. However, beware a veggie pizza isn't a veggie at all. We asked to change it because it was also very spicy with hardly any veggies at all and the lady who we spoke with responded in a snarky manner when we asked to change it. She pointed at the board and said the ingredients are listed there (like we are somehow supposed to know). Just very pretentious, entitled, and snooty. Not the friendly homey experience at all. Not ever going back again."
4,"Been coming here for years, even after moving away from the area, I still make it in whenever in the area. Always get the prime melt, it has been consistent for over 20 years. Wife loves the lemon pepper wings. Service is always prompt and polite."
4,"I really enjoyed my visit here. We had brews and some nachos. The nachos were good.  Definitely not bar food. Someone knows how to elevate nachos. We ate every last one, even the cheese soaked ones at the bottom. Great wait staff and the new outside seating area was great. They had a singer, Elliot Dickinson was his name I believe. He was entertaining. I'll visit again for sure. Lots and lots of beers to try!"
4,Such a great restaurant! The food is so delicious and authentic and the atmosphere is so relaxing and romantic. We love coming here!! Reasonable prices and the servers are all awesome
4,"Love the atmosphere. Was a very popular place. Line down the block but did not stand in line long. It goes quick! 

Great bbq. 

Will not disappoint."
2,I have had their wings which were good and their calzones which were an unusual shape and pretty dang good!
4,Awesome place especially to see Jenny devoe and if they still have the chicken jalapeno poppers they are fire. Make your eyes twitch.
2,Just wasn't wowed. Fried chicken tacos were somewhat tasteless. Salmon cake sandwich was generous but salmonie. Acoustics poor. Two tops were very long so your slightly disconnect with one your with.  For the wow factor dine next doorI
1,"So...I had high high hopes for this historic spot.  Maybe it lost allure because I went during the day, or it could have been because of the football game, or the rap music that was blaring.  I expected quaint and was met with the opposite. Underwhlemed and happy that drinks are ""to go"" in NOLA"
3,"The most chic, freshest atmosphere that is both a nail and hair salon in the city of New Orleans. Need a glass of champagne as you're waiting for your service or getting it done? It's on the house. They have every nail color possible and incredible staff. A great place to come for a day of pampering and relaxation."
3,"This is a great zoo, with a wonderful focus on New Orleans and Cajun life in one section. Only one white alligator there now as the rest are out on loan to other zoos. Wonderful grounds. Plan for a full day."
4,"would come back to philly just to be served by chandler again, she was fantastic! plus the wings are delicious"
2,"I'm not sure if it's a particular style of Indian cuisine for curry or vindaloo to not have any visible spices or vegetables. It was almost like tomato sauce which would be appetizing if it were tomato sauce.

But the garlic naan was on point!"
3,"Their food is good as long as you avoid the Asian options. The Asian options are truly terrible and it's super disappointing as all of the other food is super tasty. If you own Cluster Truck and are reading this, please work on improving these dishes!!"
4,"Absolutely wonderful restaurant! We ordered the spinach dip as an appetizer, and it honestly was some of the best I've ever tasted. If you're into BBQ, highly recommend the biscuit bun for the Little Pig, it's delicious! The lettuce wraps with Tea Chicken is also amazing. All in all, friendly staff, wonderful atmosphere, delicious food, and not pricy! Also, all profits go towards helping Nashville's homeless! A great place with a great cause!"
4,Love this place.  For vegetarians the champion burger is much better than the veggie burger.  Fresh brewed tea and seasoned ketchup are flavorful and outside the norm.
0,"I came here to get prescription.When I told to front desk girl about my problem ,she just told me I need to wait and after that I heard that she is laughing with the doctor.After she came and told me that they can't give me my prescriptions. Terrible place. Don't go there."
3,"Loved seating outside, lots of people going in and out. Everything is super fresh, and you can taste it. They have all kinds of mix and match bowls, you'll be able to try something new every time. Had ahi tuna poke with spiced rice veggies and the creamy white ginger sauce. All there Tess and juices are freshly made. The seasonal tea was a green tea, it was very refreshing and not too sweet. Food is a little pricey for what you get, $30 for a small bowl, large bowl, and 1 tea. Will definitely be back though."
4,"Everything I had was great, the Vladamir Poutine is excellent, and don't forget the cheese sauce to go along with your crack fries."
4,Spectacular food. I ordered the beef salad and the steamed dumplings and they were both very good. Had the drunken noodle with Shrimp as my entree and it definitely the best drunken dish i ever had. Great am iance and very good service as well.
4,"Me and my wife was referred to this establishment by a relative, and was very pleased, I ordered the grilled cheese on Texas toast with beef bacon and home fries, my wife ordered home fries walnut street waffles and the big bird(I love a woman with an appetite) all were delicious and filling, we will definitely be going back, I'm just sorry I wrote this review after and didn't take any photos so you all can see the portions, which as I said was filling."
3,Hubby and I had dinner here last night. Service was very personable and on point. Food was good too! We had the hook and reel special blend spicy - def recommend but it's spicier than you would imagine.
4,Very convenient to my house in South Tampa. The building is always clean and well lit. I feel safe going there at any time.
4,"Bought a new phone at the Verizon off Irvington, they said I didn't need to do anything in store just take it home and set it up.  Went home set up everything and realized my number was not connected, tried calling the help number, no help! Finally went to my local Verizon and Katie and Leo fixed my problem right away and were super helpful!!"
4,"They have such a yummy beef stew dish, fried rice dish and their soup and salads are a refreshing as appetizers!! The ambiance of the place is clean and trendy. All of the food is quality and full of flavor. They have boba teas and entrees such as hot pots, banh mi's, and curry as well! Highly recommend this Vietnamese restaurant. I appreciate the menu that is not overwhelmingly big, yet every dish is great. All the food here is quality!!!"
4,"Cute place. Friendly service, fast as well. I'm an out of towner & the only thing I can say is the J&M special, the roast beef is wet. If you get to go it'll be soggy even if you are 5 minutes away, grab forks if you get a forkable side, not sure if they come with. I'll definitely come back"
3,Went in Sunday evening during the second half of the Bucs game. Don't understand the poor reviews. We had great service from Ashley! Food was good drinks stayed full and we had fun! Get the philly cheese steak  yum
4,"I've always had lovely food and lovely service, here. It's my treat to myself when I'm in the area. The owner is such a wonderful person-- warm and gracious and friendly and more than willing to talk food. Or anything else! 

The lamb korma is my go-to. So rich and filling and sumptuous. I adore it!"
4,Super happy with the service here! The staff is super helpful and able to help you out with whatever you need. I called to get a lock changed and the locksmith they sent over to service me with a lock change worked super quickly and was super friendly in giving maintenance tips
4,Poutine with beef! Great food and fast very friendly service. Excellent beer selection.
4,Great deli ! Lots of options and good food. I like that the hot food selection is always looking fresh out the oven. Their specialty subs are huge and made right in front of you.
3,"What a great surprise for lunch. The food was very good including many of their lunch specials like the avocado wrap, chicken salad sandwich and Asian salad. Thank you!"
4,"This is hands down the best place around to get soup dumplings (xiao long bao). Dim Sum Garden lives up to the standard of xiao long bao abroad, in China. And the new race street location is nicely situated and designed well."
4,Excellent place for really good coffee and a nice selection of freshly baked tasty breads and cakes. We came for breakfast early on a Sunday and it was pretty empty but still a lovely friendly atmosphere. The owners are very nice. Highly recommended!
2,"Good food , good service! Front desk cashier sometimes not very helpful, it looks like they don't really know how to take people's order, once they even over charged me! Other than that,  the food and service is worth what you pay."
4,We did a last minute booking and it was awesome! Ron was so informative about the area. The Jet Ski's are new and had some get up and go! We got the picture package rather than risking taking our cell phone. We received 2 pictures with frame and a keychain with another pic as soon as we were done and will receive the rest via email. Highly recommend!
0,SLOOWWWWW. Waited forever for table. Waited like hour After we order food had to track down waiter cause food was taking so long it seemed like she forgot to put in.  Then when food Came tasted awful.
1,"Food was good but THE SERVICE WAS HORRIBLE!!! Our server Olivia was preoccupied with coworkers that came by to hang out, and when the manager was informed he looked at me like i was wrong and was of NO HELP!! I had to go and get my own flatware because she was too busy with coworkers who were off the clock."
3,"Review for brunch.
I had scrambled eggs, Turkey sausage, hash browns, grits, toasted bagel- everything cooked perfectly. 
The mimosa was a little heavy on the oj but our server was kind enough to give us more champagne.  Sister had the chicken biscuit and fruit. It tasted delicious. The kids seem to enjoy  food from the kids menu. I would definitely recommend this resturant. It has a upscale dinner/ deli feel."
4,Dr. Roman is the man! Easy appointment and very professional. He goes over your provided documents to make sure you qualify and makes the process simple. Thanks Doc!
2,The buffet is expensive but the food is not bad need little renovations just everything is out dated
4,This restaurant is the bomb!!  If I lived in Nashville I would be there once a week.  The atmosphere and the food is the best.  Yes--the cauliflower is fantastic---husband had the lamb chops and he devoured them.  I had the venison and it was so tasty.  We shared the Etch salad between us and it was a perfect accompaniment to our entrees.  Waiter was very knowledgeable and made some great suggestions.  Our daughter is going to Nashville in September and I have urged her to go to Etch!!
4,[Landlord perspective] We are very pleased with this property management group. Dana was very patient with onboarding us and making sure all our questions were answered. The rest of the team has been highly responsive as well. They quickly found great tenants and everything has been smooth sailing. Very glad we chose Bay Management!
4,"Awesome. Maybe things have changed, but the review about ""lack of fries"" could not be further from the truth. We had so many we had to throw them away. Free ice cream with every meal through February 2012!!!!"
4,"Two Fish is an exciting addition to Haddonfield. The items on the focused menu are all very well executed. We've enjoyed the Sicilian calamari (tender), red curry mussels, salmon, skate, tuna (perfectly rare) and beef. Service is professional yet friendly. It is a small, cozy space great for a relaxing, delicious meal. We've been three times and still look forward to our next visit."
4,Every time I come here I feel as if I am treated like a Queen even though I am no one special. The food? Amazing. The ambiance? Amazing. The service? Amazing. The hospitality? Literally out of this world. Thank you Louie for existing. The universe is a better place with you in it.
2,I did not like the mayonnaise they put on the burger. It made it taste too salty. The fries are great and they give you ranch. I ordered a Moscow Mule and they did not serve it in a copper cup as described but in a glass.  My fiancé had fish and chips and loved it. I might come back for a basket of fries and another Mule if served in the correct cup.
4,"AAA PLUS! On time, professional and delivered with grace! The 2 delivery guys were awesome!
They were friendly, Covid safe with gloves and masks !
The delivery was in the am and the outside had ice and frost on the driveway and stairs into my house. They handled the delivery with excellence!
The driver was absolutely perfect,  as I have a 500 foot ldriveway and most drivers have difficulty, but not for this man! Absolutely professional and I highly recommend the company and the most important part of the puzzle delivery!!"
4,"I stopped by Tildie's today in search of a gift.  I know nothing about children and what they do with themselves, but the friendly and helpful staff person gave me about a dozen great recommendations in minutes.  All were reasonably priced, and there were plenty of affordable options, all of high quality.  They even gift wrapped for free, and I only spent about $20.   Tildie's will definitely be my first stop every time I need a gift for kids.  Special kudos for lots of non-gendered toys good for all kinds of kids and their interests."
4,"This place is a must-try if you visit Tampa. It was our first time here but everything was absolutely delicious. Probably some of the best Italian that we have had in a while. Everything from the soup to the dessert was amazing, and we would definitely recommend the sacchettini pasta, orange creme brûlée, and limoncello cake if you come. We will definitely be back."
0,"Had very bad experience. But luckily I was with wonderful friend and environment was good sitting outside in nice weather. 
I would like to suggest future customer to please be careful. They made mistake with chicken order for shrimp (specially if you have allergy) and brought us the incorrect charge with more $$"
3,"My family and I have been here several times and we really love the food.. portions are great , prices are normal and having an option to sit outside is super fun for the kids. Service is ok, definitely improved since the re opening of  new ownership. I would say give it a try when you are in the area."
4,"Great barber shop. Always friendly and does a great job. Consistent. Hard to find a great barber especially one that can do a good fade... Waiting room only no appointments.

When he gets busy and fills up he closes the door/sign early so make sure you call ahead if it's after 3.

Highly recommended!"
3,"Have only been here once and it was years ago. It was crazy delicious, and love the location. Need to go back."
3,Open late. Better (cleaner) than Steve Steaks. Cheesesteak weighed a ton. We'll be back on the late night top.
4,One of my favorite pizza places in the city. The cheesesteak pizza is a must. And the fact that they deliver means i have had this with a bunch of different friends and they love it too
0,"This is regarding Sears Home Services in Harrisburg, PA.  No technician showed up at the time scheduled and my appointment was changed without my permission. I was then unable to cancel the new appointment, the website saying this might be because parts were ordered. That was nonsense since how would they know what parts to order if they never were here?   

I was able to cancel the appointment after calling. I will say that the gal on the phone at the call center was very nice.  She had no control over anything.  I'm also a CSR and know how that goes. 

I would recommend that no one use this service."
4,"I love this restaurant! The food is amazing and very delicious. The portions are huge and filled with amazing spices. The Cheese Enchiladas are the absolute very best. The Chili Bean Dip is great and it is served with warm tortilla chips. The Salsa is sweet and refreshing, too. 

I love this place, ahhhhhhh!"
3,"I really do like this place.  This is all you can eat korean bbq. Their service is great and they have some great sides (ban chan). 

My favorites being the mushrooms and bomb ass kim Chi, the beef belly and the house special marinated short ribs. Kim chi rice was yummy too.

They have the korean pepper sauce (gochu jang?) if you ask.

The only dilemma is dinner being almost 30 bucks a person without tax and tip, a little steep."
2,Good solid Wawa but this place can be super crowded and have hardly any standing room during peak lunch hours.  Cases and displays can seem a bit threadbare as well during these crunch times.  Sandwich makers however get orders in and out quickly so kudos to them!  I haven't visited during off-peak times but imagine it's a calmer pace and environment.
4,"I've been using this site for many years. Just finished spending $1K on tires, alignment, oil change and a new battery. Rick Guevara, the manager is a person of integrity that helps you understand the  technical in layman's terms. The staff of  assistants Chris and Rodney are very knowledgeable and friendly. They speak Spanish and my experience has always been good with excellent service."
3,"The food was very fresh, and you get more food than you think which aligns with the pricing. (Of course the pricing reflects where they're located.)  
I ordered the black bean hummus wrap, which came with corn salsa and pita chips. Yay for real vegetarian food at a deli. There was a lot of quinoa and veggies in there, along with the beans, which I appreciated because that helped to keep me full. The chips were super seasoned, which I liked, but might be off putting for some. The salsa side was great; super flavorful."
4,"What a great l'il (not so little, actually) space.  You can tell that atrsy-theatre types have made this space what it is - and it is a GREAT multi-purpose ""Black box"" theatre with a great array of gigs/shows & films that can be showcased here.

GOOD JOB!!!  I'm sold on 941!"
3,I order a pizza weekly for carryout for my mother. It's always ready when promised and the pizza looks good and tastes great. The people are always friendly even when they're busy. I honestly have no complaints.
1,"Wife and I are here. I had the Steak & Salmon Hibachi, wife had Steak & Shrimp Hibachi. The steak was tough. It was also sliced with the grain and not against the grain. What chef doesn't know that? There is a good band playing, but they are playing in the dark. 
We will probably not dine here again.
Decor could be better. Too bright at the tables. Ceiling should be dark."
4,I'm from Los Angeles and we got brisket. Hands down the best place so far. Bbq sauce was AMAZING. You need to go try this place out.
4,I enjoyed the meal here. I knew what I wanted but too hungry to go through the menu. The bartender ordered me exactly what I wanted.  I'm not sure if they had it together on the menu. The food tasted good. Would definitely eat here again if in the area.
3,"Me and my boys love coming to B&N for story time, purchase books and play with the toys! I would love for B&N to make their bathroom sinks more kids & handicap accessible. They have a handicap stall but there is not way anyone in a wheelchair is reaching the soap dispenser of the sinks. As for the children, my son is 3 1/2 and can't reach the soap or the sink either. It should be updated or at least add a stool for now."
4,"My husband and I enjoyed a wonderful breakfast today.  The food was incredible.  We each had an omelet with the best tasting ham ever.  Wish we were in New Orleans longer, would definitely go back.  The staff members were very friendly.  Highly recommend.  You will not go away hungry."
3,Great Southern Food! A little salty but overall worth visiting while in Nashville.
4,"The staff at our hotel told us when we asked of good places to eat and they said, ""Be sure to go to Demo's downtown Nashville."" We did and loved it so much we ate there twice. 
We had a wait staff named Flo wait on us and she was phenomenal! She went out of her way to please us. 
If you're in the area, be sure to go. The prices are very reasonable too."
2,"What can I say, it's cheap, easy, fast and simple while still being relatively healthy.  It's not really Mexican despite being based on Mexican cuisine.  It's more of a Gringo restaurant.  At least I know I can go into one in Manhattan or Indy and get the same thing.  The only difference being one has a longer line."
0,Service in this place has gone downhill. People that were seated after us got served much earlier than we have.
3,"The food here is excellent. The oysters, the crab meat salad, the pecan crusted fish....all top quality and well prepared. The steaks are a little on the ""meh"" side; however, it is a seafood restaurant. The service is always prompt and the staff has always been friendly. Get yourself a dozen or so oysters and explore the large menu. The liquor prices are fair and it in a good location in Fat City. The parking can be difficult and tough at times but it is worth it."
4,Did a baby shower here for my best friend and we had such an amazing experience! I was blown away by the service! The waitstaff was so helpful and pleasant from the moment we walked in the door. The food was delicious and the place was beautiful.
3,"Great place to stop after a walk in Schuylkill River Park! They're open relatively late too. I love the outdoor seating, which is almost always available. I think the greek yogurt flavor is underrated--great with granola or oreos as toppings. They recently switched from using cards for their loyalty program to using phone numbers, which is even more enabling for my froyo habit, since I don't even need to have my loyalty card with me to get the points."
3,great customer service by the lovely lady with glasses.
4,"Muy buen deal, el desayuno estuvo okey, lo que más nos gustó fue el colchón muy confortable, nos ayudó a descansar muchísimo"
2,I am always on the hunt for a great plain cheese pizza. Have ordered the wood grilled pizza and it is okay. Too me the sauce isn't sweet enough. The overall pizza is between a thin crust and a regular thicker crust. Could use more overall flavor as well. It also didn't feel very wood grilled- see picture. The pros include though- not very greasy and easy to eat.
1,"Not sure why, but the kitchen has gone to shit. Lived nearby for 5 years and the food has steadily gone downhill. I know it changed ownership a few years ago. It's a damn shame because it used to be my go-to. 
Pictured is the Instagram special, the bottom is the reality."
4,"Off the hook Reuben sandwich and some the of the best, most flavorful  potato salad. I am picky on my potato salad and was assured it was fantastic. Glad I took the plunge!"
1,"Walked in and asked the hostess if I could just sit at the bar for lunch... I sat there for 15 minutes without any acknowledgement, so I got up and left. Not a great first impression"
4,I really enjoyed this place! It was clean and many floors so it didn't feel crowded. There were different artists on each floor. I ended up on the roof with a crowd of about 8 people. We got to know the cover artist and even put in requests! There's a wide variety of drinks here from cocktails to wine. It was also cleaner than most of the bars on Broadway. I can't wait to go back! I most definitely recommend.
4,"Get the duck wings!!! They were amazing! Fun place and great food, everything was delicious."
4,"This is the place to come and buy fresh seafoods crawfishes, shrimps, crabs etc. For a great deal! Lots of vendors around to purchase fresh fishes and other items. Bring that big cooler. You will need it"
4,"This is such a great neighborhood restaurant! The pizza is to die for , salads are always fresh and the calzones  are perfect. I love byos and my favorite part about Mama's is that I am never rushed. At a lot of byob's once you finish your food you are hovered until you walk out the door. Not here, feel free to finish your bottle, conversation and maybe even get an espresso (if you aren't overly stuffed from the brick oven fabulous-ness that you just devoured)  you won't regret coming here!!"
4,"Really nice quality food and meat, large portions, with great prices. The staff was very accommodating to our large group. Highly recommended."
3,"Our bicycling group went for happy hour, but some of us ordered off the regular menu. We shared nachos with chicken and each had beers. I am a left hand milk stout beer drinker, others had ambers and IPA's. Around the table I saw salads, fish tacos, hummus plate, bruschetta and even a slice of chocolate cake for the person celebrating a birthday. We sat at the outside porch and had a great time! Very good waitress! My only complaint was the chicken was dry on the nachos."
0,"Scam. Cost is ""discounted"" to $1,800 if you pay cash and all at once. Doesn't work!  No refunds. Buyer beware. I lost 13lbs a far cry from the 40 lbs I was guaranteed and I followed the program to a T. I was STARVING the entire program. The Dr is rude, condescending, and uses reverse psychology pressure tactics to sell you. You have to agree to the $1,800-2,000 BEFORE he tells you it is a 500 calorie diet. He is a chiropractor not a real doctor."
2,"A good authentic tasting Korean restaurant.  Had the bulgogi, tofu soup and chapchae.  Came with kimchi and prices were reasonable.

Near 12th and porter, I'm always in the mood for Korean food.  The tofu soup was really good, I imagine the kimchi stew is as well."
0,"I hate to write bad reviews when a place has such nice staff, but this is not true ramen, it looks and tastes like instant noodles. I love ramen, I have been to all the authentic Japanese ramen shops like the famous one in Little Tokyo in LA. But this place is not like that at all. If you know what real japan ramen is this is like the instant noodle version of it not hand made noodles."
4,"Best spring rolls, pad Thai, and Thai coffee ever!!! + great service. 10/10 would recommend."
4,"Came here on Jan 19th to celebrate my birthday . 

Everything we've tried on the menu was delicious with amazing and unique flavors."
4,Jeff yoshimoto is a awsome honest and reliable individual. You can't go wrong going with jeff
1,"I heard so much great things about crawfish in New Orleans, but I have to say I am very disappointed.  For market price menu listed. It was not fresh crawfish at all, I believe that these crawfish were frozen.  On top of this, we got a bottle of white wine on a sunny day (80 degrees )She did not chill it with ice in the bucket."
3,"Fast, friendly service but I prefer the location near the Costco off I65.  The staff seemed knowledgeable, they organized the wait time to get us out as quickly as possible, and staff was wearing masks."
3,"On very short notice, I was able to schedule an appointment to look at wedding dresses with my mom. We met with a sales woman named Leary - who is also originally from the Chicago area - who took us into the bridal gown room and was an absolute joy to have guiding me in different dress styles to try on. CC's has a beautiful selection of dresses that would make anyone feel like a queen on her wedding day. Thank you so much to Leary and CC's for giving my mom the special experience of seeing her daughter try on dresses for her wedding day. :)"
4,Very professional staff and doctors.   Very short wait times and very accommodating to parents busy schedules. Would recommend to anyone!
4,The BEST liberty onion soup EVER!! To die for! Thank you for the recommendation Mica!
4,"Corner of Frenchman and Chartres, live local band in the background playing. Their crawfish ettouffe fries, to die for. There is a hot dog for EVERYONE, for vegetarians, vegabs, meat lovers, seafood fans. The drinks are well poured, staff is super friendly!"
0,This place needs to fix their seats.  I do appreciate that the handicapped seats are not in the front row but the seats are in very bad shape.  I know that this is a discount theater but seats are essential.  They are so uncomfortable that  I don't know if I will be able to stay for the whole movie.  I do know that I won't be back.
2,"First time tonight and it was...meh. 

I ordered the Crab Rangoons and Pad Thai Chicken. The Rangoons were small, mostly wonton, with filling that didn't pack much flavor. The Pad Thai sauce didn't taste like typical Pad Thai and there was very little chicken. The chicken I did find was cut into very small pieces.

I will say it was fast. I ordered on DoorDash and had my food 15 minutes later, when the expected wait time was 30-40 minutes.

I may try it again, but it wasn't a great take out meal by far."
0,"Scammer stay away the sell fake and they hide the defects in the items they sell , big misleading"
0,If i could give less stars i would!  Terrible job on my daughters homecoming dress!  Charged $85 because it had beading...then had to wait 2 hrs after it was supposed to be done because they had to take it out over an inch and redo beading!  Terrible customer service... Awful seamstress work!   I will NEVER come back and will make it my mission that no one else i know comes here!
4,Top Gun has been one of my main sources for shooting supplies.  The indoor range lanes are top quality and clean. The air quality is only second to being outside. Good selection of supplies and accessories. Full line of firearms available for rent to make sure a particular model or caliber are what you expect before buying. The staff are friendly and helpful. The full time gunsmith is a great addition and the full time personal firearms instructor will improve your skills regardless of experience level.
4,"Not my first rodeo here....5 star food everytime and their new location near Butler Campus, a collaboration with Chilly Water Brewing is rockin...authentic and excellent...dont take my word for it, take all the other yelpers too"
1,"Good price, but when they promise to get the love bugs off that couldn't be further from the truth."
3,"This is good pizza, straight up.  The Santa Fe is my favorite and there simply isn't a better pizza in Reno.  The employees and manager are down-to-earth and  nice, but will not kiss your ass.  I see a lot of 'attitude' reviews, so if attitude is more important to you than good pizza, go elsewhere.

If they had a larger dining space I'd give them a full 5 stars."
3,"Only the best salsa i have had! The salsa was so good,  after eating three bowl full,  i purchased a container to take home. 
The steak fajita quesadilla is very good.  The guacamole they actually make table side. 
For a chain, Chevys is really good."
4,"Tonight, my friends and I went to Copper Vine and it was really amazing. From the beautiful views in the courtyard to delicious wines; this was really a great dining experience. Not to mention, our waiter John was so awesome!!!! He definitely added to the entire experience. He's was very knowledgeable about the wines and everything on the menu. He was so attentive and literally was there for everything we needed! Such an amazing dinner."
0,Was excited to try the food but waited 45 minutes for the food and ended up canceling our order.  My vodka tonic tasted just like tonic minus the vodka.  Highly disappointed!!  Didn't get to try the food.
4,Fantastic food. Polly gives great recommendations and the drinks are to die for!  Great to go packaging!!!!
4,The food was delicious and the staff and management really went the extra mile to be sure our delivery order arrived and tasted great!
3,Several different flavors of ice cream with unique blends.  Definitely a great place to experience.  Great space and location in central west end.
4,"Yvonne did an amazing job! My hair was was long and breaking, so I decided to cut it short for the first time in 6 years. Yvonne has so much experience in this industry, and it showed! She took her time making sure my hair was perfect and looked exactly how I wanted. Definitely going to go to this salon again thanks to her!"
1,"Normally I have a good experience.  Tonight (28 Feb 2019) there seemed to be a glitch in the Matrix.   Called for a delivery order, I was on hold for 6 minutes.  When I called back, the guy taking the order had an attitude when I asked is that standard for customers to be on hold for 6 minutes. Their customer service has fallen on the last few months.  They now rate 2 stars!"
4,"They have moved to Clinton street in Delaware
City. The food is great. Cupcakes are delicious. The breakfast is awesome. The staff are sweet and remember their customers. They will even tell me what I ordered last time. Try the Aaron. It's the Gus with sausage instead of scrapple."
3,"Good beer, still part of the mask horseshit religion. Wear a mask and sit shoulder to shoulder at the bar facially nude.  Wave a crystal and the germs go away!"
1,"Breakfast was very good but the service was subpar at best.  Our server was horrible, I got one mimosa that sat empty for most of the meal to which I would have ordered another, but apparently they don't really need my business.  Hopefully next time we won't get a server that just chills in the back.  Her name was Sydney. ;("
4,"Drove an hour and a half to try the pulled pork and it did not disappoint us. VERY good food. Had the baked beans and cole slaw as sides. Came home with a bottle of Pappy's original BBQ sauce, (hubby liked the Hoodoo sauce, said it was hotter) Will definitely go back again!"
4,"Amazing space!! I came here when it was The Wayward Owl. Since it closed and became Zony Mash, it's SOOOOOO much cooler! They renovated the space to where it made more sense. The beer is great, they have lots of seating AND plan on opening the attached building as well! They brought back the spinning sign on Broad St from when it was a tire shop. It's a great neighborhood brewery. I HIGHLY recommend."
1,The big attraction is the patio which is fantastic.  The food is so-so.  You can definitely find better Mexican food elsewhere.  The steak tacos are not steak.  Instead they are more of a low quality roast cut of beef.  I'd recommend for drinks on the patio but not if you going for the food solely.
3,"Definitely a fan! I recently stayed here for a business related trip to Tampa and I was pleasantly surprised. I am a clean freak and I check the room before even bringing in my luggage for bed bugs and other dirty possibilities. I had no complaints about the cleanliness of my room. Everything was spot on. 

I really liked the lobby too. They have a cafe where you can buy full meals and drinks. They also have tables with TVs. I bought breakfast at the cafe and sat at one of those tables to watch my morning news. I really liked this idea. 

Keep up the good work, Courtyard!"
3,Their hotdogs are awesome.  The mistake I made was ordering my Italian beef with extra sauce you need to order it dry and get the sauce on the side or your bread will be too mushy.
3,Great location and vibe. Drinks are a bit over priced. Food was decent. They should think about putting lighter options for hot days. Most things were fried and heavy.
1,"Wow... If you guys are going to change your business hours (6 months ago?!?), it would be great if you updated your website or menu or something.  Love the hoagies & bummed I'm going hungry tonight.  It's a weekend night.  Seriously?"
3,Fish Tacos were delicious and the Fess Parker Syrah was amazing. Great service and atmosphere
4,"Wow what a great little hidden authentic gem! Best Mexican food I've ever had, and I'm from California"
4,"The best Chinese in Carmel by far.  Super fried rice, Singapore noodles are excellent.  Place is spotlessly clean and staff is pleasant.  If you're familiar with east coast/NY style Chinese this is it! I drive out of my way to go here for super takeout."
4,Everything was perfect. Burger cooked a perfect MR. Great fries. Great service.
4,Love City Dog.  Everything I've tried on the menu has always been fantastic! The staff is always friendly & the service is excellent.
2,Very good donuts just loaded with lots of sugar ... But still tasty...customer service was good ... Also seems like a place to study and relax
4,"Margie and Dawn and associates just finished our awesome backyard project in July 2019. They took it from concept to completion and always had great ideas, drawings and practical suggestions to keep everything in budget. In the end we ended up with what we wanted and it looks terrific. Her crew worked diligently and professionally during the dirt and hardscape phase and Margie did a great job with the trees and plantings. Definitely recommend considering if you are looking to create an awesome landscape."
3,Some disorganization. Confusion on codes/prices of produce. Fabulous store roasted turkey - like as is or better than Whole Foods for less cost. Spotty on weird gourmet items. Better on ethnic items.
3,"I am enamored of the way the noodle-maker rolled his dough and tossed it so perfectly to beat the gluten to noodle submission.  I would go back just to watch the process.  Well, that, and the cheap noodles, of course."
4,"Absolutely love this place the food was great the service was awesome.  Enjoyed the chocolate shake and can't wait to try another meal!  If you have not been to this place you should try it out, you will not be disappointed."
4,"For an affordable, easy-to-get-into nail salon this is the place to be!  You really can't beat the prices, I've never had to wait long even without an appointment, and I love the ""express"" manicures and pedicures.  They will open early if you need them to and they provide cold bottled water."
3,"What a fantastic place to visit. The staff at the Hermitage are incredibly friendly and knowledgeable.  I loved being able to do a majority of the tour at my own pace, listening to information on the headsets that are provided to you when you start the tour (listen to the kids version if you go...very entertaining and educational as well!).  I definitely recommend a trip to The Hermitage - just make sure to give yourself at least two hours."
4,"Great local place! I saw an article about places in Tampa that use local ingredients, and Refinery was at the top of the list. I came on a Sunday night, and they had live music on the deck. I had the burger, which was delicious, with fries, which were even better. Highly recommend!"
0,Saw an ad on Facebook and I needed a torsion spring replaced so I thought I would give them a try.  Gave them my phone number and address.  They said they would call in the morning.  They came by and started ringing my doorbell!  I did NOT say come by and ring my doorbell.  If they can't follow their own instructions I wouldn't trust them to touch anything on a garage door.
2,"It was fun and great for the kids... but a few things DEFINITELY could have been better. For instance the food... bland, over priced, only tasted decent because of the condiments. Also their tubes for the slides and lazy river were so deflated it was unbelievable. The had multiple things shut down too so you were very limited on what we could do. I would take my daughter back but they should really step up their game a bit. They amount of money I put out wasn't worth it."
0,"Fire Hazard 

The food is fine. The service is fine. However, this is in a very busy strip mall with little parking. I worked up an appetite walking to the place from my spot. We got seated immediately, kinda. There's only single file aisles and u have to wait in others movinG around or being seated. The tables are so close that I could tell u a complete history of the ppl next to me lives. Got a burrito w mole. Good and interesting food but the place was too cramped for me to return."
3,Great place for vintage camera stuff. They are tucked away off the beaten path but well worth checking out. They do offer transfer of many types of film onto dvd.
0,The owner of this place is a complete a_ _hole! I left a brand new $100 Nike NFL jersey and upon returning to pick it up the numbers were completing coming off the jersey. This was the 1st time I ever wore the jersey and he told me it wasn't his fault and if I didn't leave his store he was calling the cops. I would never leave anything here unless you understand there is a good chance the item might be returned damaged! BEWARE!!!
1,Food is decent at times when you are lucky.  But every single time I have been in here service is horrible! Man handing out menus rude and doesn't know how to smile etc.  We were almost done with our food before we were even asked how it was. This will probably be my last chance i give to this place.
0,"Will not be returning ever.
This establishment does not honor their policies and I ended up paying $10 for food that I was supposed to get on a credit already on my room. Management refused to honor the credit they were so vocal about me having beforehand. Not worth my money!"
0,"Waited 8 minutes before host/server noticed us. Restaurant was empty other than 2 guests at the bar. There were only two of us we asked to sit at the bar and she said she'd have to check if seating was available. She sat a party of 10 and 3 minutes later came back and said it would be a 15 minute wait.... 

The place was empty.... seats everywhere."
1,"Sorry but the food here just does not taste fresh...I ordered the chicken teriyaki dish. 

The rice, salad, and miso soup were good. However the main dish was really lacking...the teriyaki sauce on the chicken tasted watered down and the chicken was of a weird consistency...just not tasty at all. It was also waaay overpriced for what I received. (This cost me $16). 

I also felt kind of gross after finishing eating here as one of the other reviews pointed out. (Annie K)"
2,"Don't go here if you are thirsty.  Went there during the afternoon and had great drinks and an awesome band.  When we went back a night. The drinks were served in a 7 ounce plastic cup packed full of ice with only a splash of liquor.  Cool place, but the drinks suck."
2,"Great buffet chicken dishes fresh,yogurt dressing light and tasty good rice pudding .lentils very good"
4,"Hands down the best Cheese Steak I ever had.  I love the chopped steak over ribbon style and you can really get the fixing anyway you want.  This place is in the suburbs of Philly so prices and waiting time is good.  They don't have a ton of seating though.  Also huge sandwich, my wife and I couldn't finish each of ours and had the rest as a snack during our drive back to NY."
3,"Great food and friendly service, very lucky to have this place in our neighborhood. We would highly recommend this place."
4,Loved this place and the owners were lovely They have a wide variety of gourmet grocery items and a huge selection of delicious oils and vinegars -which they blend their favorite combos for you to try or help you find yours. Wine and cheese will be coming soon
3,"The food looks excellent, It's deffinately a place I would bring the family to dine, a big plus!"
4,"Best wings in the city!!! The Cavanaugh's sauce is a must try! The rest of the food is also good, but the wings... Also they have decent specials and beer selection, and the staff is always friendly."
3,Fantastic tacos and specials. I love their ripe avocado.
3,Been here twice. Decor inside the restaurant was nice and place was clean. Service was quick and food was ok.
4,"Saw this on Man V Food and these people know how to BBQ.  OMG it is just good.  Order the ribs and choose from BBQ sauces, the original and spicy are the best.  Dont forget to get the sweet potato fries!"
3,"The owner is friendly and the food is delicious. Definitely worth a visit. Also, if you're a coffee fan, their espresso is especially good."
0,Massage was great but chiropractor is a Scam artist now the damn chiropractor is making comments on my post get a life
4,This Hotel is the best! The rooms are clean and well laid out. Lauren at the front desk is sweet as soda pop! Will definitely stay here again!
0,These wings were soggy tasteless & a waste of $12 & who the hell puts sliced garlic cloves on wings NEVER AGAIN !
4,"Full disclosure: I had thot I was dating one of the employees for what turned out to be a few months. When I found out we weren't really an ""item"" it annoyed ne but I got over it pretty quick. Also, it turns out she works at ""a bar"", so I guess my bad for assuming it was this spot. Good deal for PBRs if you drink those!"
3,Covid experience: I love the drink choices they offer and the drink I had (Orange) was very good. The server here was very busy but overall service was good. I thought the food was decent but could be better.
4,My partner and I really like this urgent care. Rarely do we have to wait. Courteous and professional.
1,"Very disappointed in the customer service. As a new customer they are very helpful. Once they get you in you don't exist, unless you are LOUD. Not a good way to start AND it keeps me from adding cable."
3,I remember this was Bonanza Restaurant about 40 years ago and King Edward's chicken is still next door!   Came in on a Sunday with limited time and two of us had the Rubin and it was excellent!  They took care of us fast and all is well.  They have big booths and it's nothing fancy.
2,"Trendy, crowded and overprice. However, the food is okay, and it's probably a good place for a date.
But if you're looking for proper Asian food, China Town is not that far :)"
1,Staff is so friendly. Love the concept. But the food is such a huge miss. Our food came out cold. I gave them the benefit of the doubt as ask for it reheated. Still cold. The crustless quiche is just scrambled eggs.  Everything lacked flavor. Probably will not be back.
4,"Came hungry AF.
Got the beef pho & pork shrimp spring rolls.
Beef pho had 3 kinds of beef. 
Rare steak. Beef balls. I forgot the last one.
Devoured it. Inhaled it. Didn't even chew.
Even the water tasted great.
10/10 would eat here again.
No further comments."
4,"This place was so good the queso was delicious and so was the salsa sampler. I also got the shrimp taco, grilled salmon taco, and pork belly taco. They were all delicious and the service was amazing especially for a large group . The drinks are good too and the prices are reasonable. Would highly recommend."
4,"We came for my moms bday dinner and had bob! In 33 years we have not had a better waiter! The food was excellent, the staff was top notch and the atmosphere is amazing!!!!"
3,"Excellent food.  Restaurant is very big and spacious.  Good sandwiches, burgers and salads."
3,Nothing like going to church on sunday.....when the church has been renovated into a brewery! Beautiful wood work in side and the lighting is fantastic. They offer a great variety of beers and a really killer brunch menu. I had the Huevos Rancheros and it was super delicious. The room is large and accomidates big crowds of people. If you live in the area or are just driving thru you should stop in this place! You wont regret it!
4,"Always great food and great service.  Most of the time there a line to get in, but trust me when I say it's worth it.  The drinks are strong and delicious, food is authentic and amazing.   The chargrilled oysters are what keeps me coming back every time.  I love the city of New Orleans with all of my heart and Acme is truly a gem I will stay loyal to in this wonderful city of magic and dreams.  From Houston to New Orleans, acme oyster house is the place to stop and eat."
0,"Update: my item finally shipped, except it shipped via FedEx Smartpost, which means it's basically being walked here at the speed of an elderly Sherpa. 

To top it off, I got a request from Clever Training to review the item. Well now how the fuck can I review an item I haven't even received yet, despite purchasing it last century?"
2,"Since Chicago is my hometown, I've always have had very high standards when it comes to pizza.I was at this restaurant on the day before Christmas Eve as I was heading down to Florida with my family. The service that we received from the waiter was good and the pizza wasn't bad going by Chicago standards!.I also tried the garlic knots and those were good too."
4,"This is absolutely the best seafood I've ever had it is in a take-out format so call ahead the food is priced right the quantity you get is exceptional for the price and the quality of the food is absolutely outstanding I could make this at least twice a week place to eat the rice bowls, shish kebabs and fish dinners are absolutely astounding not to mention that the pasta that you can get with seafood of your choice chicken is also available."
0,"The inspection was fine, but BPG shared our contact information without our consent to a national company called porch.com. Now we are getting marketing emails and phone calls in the midst of moving. There is no opt out or unsubscribe link on porch.com. Totally disgusted."
4,Very happy we tried this lovely spot by our home. Great sandwiches and super yummy homemade potato chips! Can't wait for COVID to end so we can picnic out back while enjoying our sandwiches.
0,"My daughter wanted Cuban food so we went here for lunch.  food was nothing special , we had ropa veja sandwiches and my son had a Cuban.  We are a family of 5 eating sandwiches.  The sandwiches didn't include sides so we had 4 sides...and 1 pitcher of sangria for me and wife, 3 sodas for kids.  It came to about $110.  Of course they graciously added the tip in at 20% on this lunch since apparently we were considered a large party???seriously recommend avoiding."
0,"I had a terrible dining(Lunch) experience on all counts:
1.  Parking on ground full of sand ( my dress shoes and office clothes got trashed when the sand blew up).
2. The lady at the front greeting the customers seemed like she doesn't care a bit about customers. Zero customer service.
3. We just waited and waited for someone to take our order (we noticed same situation at our neighbors table). We asked the lady (#2 above) she just shrugged us off.
4. The food was below par in preparation and taste.

Don't think I will go back."
4,"We absolutely loved our experience here. The happy hour prices were great and the service was amazing. We had Zoee as a server who was super friendly and took care of us from start to finish and also made some great suggestions for us as this was our first time here. We had the calamari and the crab hush puppies and loved both of them! We were also impressed by the covid precautions they took- masks required, hand sanitizer around the restaurant as well as on each table, and seating guests far apart!"
0,Food was excellent...service sucked.  There were exactly 16 people in the entire restaurant when we arrived at 5:15.  There are now 19 people here at 6:43 and have been waiting 17 minutes since ordering dessert.  Still nothing.
3,Pretty good. Got the spaghetti and meatballs since I was hearing good things about the red sauce. It was pricey but portions are large. It also came with a piece of bread. Overall pretty good.
4,"Dine in lunch is very good, Cesar salad is great. Staff is very prompt with service. I have eaten here 3 times this week and every visit was exceptional."
4,We go here so much and we once had a waitress and when we had her again about 2 months she remembered our order. They have amazing food and the manager is super sweet. Whenever we go their we get seated right away.
4,"I have been here twice so far and every single time the food is impeccable and the drinks are delicious. It is slowly becoming one of my favorite restaurants. The ambiance is definitely one of my favorite parts about this place. They have a screened in outside area that feels really homey with a modern twist. 
Also, I would recommend the gnocchi appetizer to anyone- its heavenly."
4,Most amazing atmosphere and the food was unbelievably delicious! I had the blackened red fish. The place is classy and located on the perfect corner of Jackson Square! After dinner enjoy some local music and a walk through the square for some great people watching. The wait staff was very friendly and we enjoyed our experience!!!
1,Nothing special for vegetarians. Salad lettuce not particularly crisp. Dressing tastes like generic Italian. Edamam hummus sandwich also not great. Store bought sliced bread with some hummus and greens. Very nice service though. Lots of space and easy for kids.
4,"Chorizo burrito is absolutely amazing!

It's a quiet place, great patio and we love to go as often as possible!"
4,Fast service and took care of my son's medical issue on a Sat.  The place is in a great location and very clean.  The staff were busy working hard for everyone and had a very caring attitude.  Please keep up the great service!!!
1,"I checked this place out when they first set up this area. It was alright. I haven't been won over by the taste at this location. I've been to a chipotle in Ohio, I definitely thought it was better there. 

The service hasn't been top notch from the last couple of times I've been there either. Sorry, I wouldn't Crave this place if time and money depended on it."
3,"Ventured out to something new today and landed here.  I had the Ya Ya Chicken, nice smooth smokey flavor.  The kids had a great catfish plate.  Take some time to look around inside while you are here."
4,"A great happy hour spot and the pricing for each item is a great deal. The food was great, I recommend the shiso rangoon and garlic butter shrimp. Lastly the service was excellent with the team work of the entire staff will attend to your need. The first time trying and won't be the last."
2,"We liked Tried and True their burgers are awesome. We were excited to try the chicken waffle bites but they weren't that great, needed more waffle. Tasted more like chicken and syrup. The onion rings were delicious and our kids love the chicken wraps.... we will go back, nice atmosphere, waitstaff could be a bit more attentive we had a young waitress that clearly doesn't enjoy waiting on people. Had her both times, kinda hope for someone with a smile on their face next time and more batter on the waffle bites."
0,This is the worst pizza I ever had. Paper thin crust no sauce and taste like they used American cheese. It is St. Louis pizza because it is an embarrassment to Italian Pizza makers. Extra cheese and pepperoni and still a 1/4 inch high. Crust stuck to the box so you end up just eating the toppings.  If you like real pizza go anywhere but IMOs.
3,The sushi is fresh and delicious!  Staff are all quite friendly!! We have been here twice and will be sure to be back.  The ice cream is odd though.  Every flavor seemed to have a minty taste.  Maybe because it is stored in the same freezer location.
3,The drink prices are fair. The bartenders aren't even close to being dicks. They're friendly with a strong pour. And maybe they'll even smoke some tree with you. A bit small and no jukebox. Music controlled beyond the bar. Those are the only downsides. Nice and dark and not too hip. I'd definitely go back. I'm surprised it took me so long to come.
0,The guys are super nice.. Prices are right.. Product is skimpy on the meat and heavy on the bread and everything artificial.. Quite frankly my family couldn't sleep from stomach cramps and the tihauana trots.. Taking the day to recoup..
2,"Came for the gooey butter cake, but was significantly let down. Maybe gooey butter cake is supposed to be cold? I don't know. This was my first encounter with it, but I was expecting it to be warm. Coffee was good. Everything bagel was divine. Reminded me of a place back home in Evansville. Would I come back? No. Am I mad I went? No."
3,Great ice cream roll place. A good variety and the employees are nice. You could actually see them roll the ice cream. The fruit toppings are fresh and it takes about 3 min or more depending the type of flavor and toppings. Overall I like this ice cream shop but I wish they had more tables because the shop is very spacious.
0,"This is likely the worse fast food place in Tucson. I ordered two fill up boxes. They said a 6 minute wait on biscuits. I happily understood and pulled up front. They said they would bring out the biscuits. After a 20 minute wait, I still received no biscuits. Stay away from this place."
4,"I really love this zoo. Probably because, while it is small, you can get so ridiculously close to the animals and really observe them. You could practically grab an otter or meerkat and put it in your purse. PLEASE PEOPLE DON'T GET ANY IDEAS!!!

It's been under construction since I arrived and left Santa Barbara, but by far I have never had a boring moment while at this zoo. Very well supported by the locals too."
4,This cute little spot is the best place in Peddler's Village to have lunch. It's pretty affordable considering the area it's in and you can tell that the staff really care about what they do and what they're serving. Their roast beef sandwich is honestly the best I've ever had. The roast beef is perfectly medium rare and made in house and all of the components of the sandwich just go together so well. The people that work here are also super nice. Go here!
2,"Rainy day comfort food is the best way to explain Urban Diner. This was my first time at this location and it wasn't too bad. Really wish I could have had the eggs benny in the picture... But must be only a weekend thing. I ordered the Frittata, as per the waitresses suggestion. It was okay. She made a comment that the apple sausage was delicious in it... Either they forgot the meat or there was almost none. That being said it tasted good, and if I had of know of the lack of sausage I would have ordered extra. Lol."
2,"This place is a cool concept but I've been here far too many times where the service is just terrible. Servers forget orders, food is brought out at all different times, and there is never an apology or reasoning for it. Has potential if they could get it together"
4,I stopped in without an appointment to have someone take a look at a superficial cut in my tire. When I got there they were full of customers but the gentleman stopped what he was doing and walked out to the parking lot give me an opinion on my tire. I was very appreciative because they could have just told me to make an appointment. Every time I have been here all of the employees are extremely courteous.
4,"Outstanding service and food!  First time visitors and the staff were great.  Had lobster, chargrilled oysters, appetizer of fried alligators bites and corn and shrimp bisque.  Lovely open restaurant"
4,I had a burrito with Carnitas. It was prepared properly and absolutely delicious. Service was polite.
4,"The value of their hoagie tray is unbeatable. This is my second time ordering their trays, I shopped around a lot my first time and found this to be the best deal. After realizing the food is as amazing as the price this is now my go to spot. For 5.50 a person you get amazing hoagies and potato and macaroni salad (which are equally as amazing as the hoagies). When I picked up the trays I got to meet the owner and he seems like a pretty cool guy."
0,Huge huge huge disappointment. I called for road side assistance and they pushed back my assistance time four different occasions.  I sat on the side of the road for more than 3.5 hours and finally had to call another company. It would have been faster to walk home or call someone in Texas to come help me. Never again will I trust this company with anything.
1,Another children's store in the city with a decent selection but HORRIBLE customer service.  Not worth your time when there are amazing websites for shopping for your babies.
0,"Terrible experience. Clueless teenagers at the hostess stand told us to seat ourselves. We sat and asked several employees for drinks before we were so annoyed we left. Waste of time. Snarky teenagers at the hostess stand recommend sharkeez! Great recommendation, quick and great drinks ! !"
4,As a contractor I eat out a lot for lunch. I saw the reviews and decided to try it out. As I sat down at the table I noticed how clean and fresh the dining looked. Then came the waitress Tawnya. All business and very efficient. She answered all the questions took our order and brought the food back so fast I thought she had roller skates on. The third time I went there I actually got her to laugh. I the food is excellent and the service was superb. A friend that was with me said she would being her grandchildren back for Sunday breakfast. Great find. Check it out.
4,Ericka is amazing! This is our first hot pot experience and we'll definitely be returning very soon. The hostess was also a sweetheart who made sure we were accommodated the entire experience. A gem!
4,"This LA Fitness Signature Club is fabulous! I was immediately impressed by how airy and well lit the place is with windows that bring in plenty of natural light. Also great about this place is the sheer number of cardio machines available. I've never had to wait while I'm there. 

This location has a pool and class space. I didn't check out the locker rooms, but I'm guess they're nice as well. There's also an attached parking garage with free parking."
4,We read the reviews on Yelp and decided to try this restaurant.  I had the Maine lobster roll and it was awesome!  It was full of lobster and not all that heavy mayo like some lobster rolls with loads of lettuce.  Just the yummy lobster!   My fiance had the Thai Shrimp Po Boy and he loved it.  It was spiced just right with lots of shrimp.  The service was excellent and the waitress was friendly and helpful.  If you go to John's Pass Village area be sure to have lunch at this fantastic restaurant - you won't be disappointed!
2,The wait was long and slow!  We had a lady help us named Fran and she was amazing.
4,Best steak I've had in a long time. The veggies were season to perfection and there onion rings and cheese fries were great. Will be having their food again
4,Best chinese food around madison county!
4,Every time I've visited All Valley I've seen professional and courteous staff. My dog was treated very well while there. When I went back to recovery to visit my dog I found a tech putting a second blanket on her because she was shaking coming out of the anesthesia. The dr.s were very caring and I love the options for and level of care that this hospital has for various problems. The rescue/adoption center is a favorite place for my daughters to browse while we are at the clinic and I think it's great that the Dr.'s choose to do this for these animals!
4,"There are trendier spots, but I haven't found a place yet with better breakfast food than Elmer's.  And it's really the food that counts, isn't it?

Service has always been great, too."
0,"Very rude office personal. They came out for quote, I wanted to give them my business and they literally WOULD NOT give me a quote and scope of work."
3,"Cool place that's in a great neighborhood. Kind of a hipster hangout, but the food is good and drinks are strong. Little details make the place very welcoming, wooden bar top with rounded rail, stamped ceiling, comfy stools, and great service. Bar back is primarily shelves and bottles. A few TVs and props for the un-PC restrooms."
1,"Have been here tons of times and have loved the service, food and especially the pitcher of margaritas! Tonight was such a disappointment. Our server was the worst we've dealt with there. She was rude and inattentive, even pretended she didn't see us walk in yet she had to walk right next to us to go into the kitchen. Too bad, this was our favorite place and we just moved closer to it."
0,"Nasty rancid smell. Nasty salad bar. Customer complaining at register. Stood and waited to be seated when there was only one table occupied. 

We escaped in a hurry."
2,Mediocre McDonald's. Ordered a steak egg and cheese bagel and got no breakfast sauce. I hate their parking lot. Always crazy busy. Not much to this review.
4,The staff here is AMAZING! We were seated on Easter Sunday within minutes! The food was incredible and the drinks were perfect.
4,"I give these cheesecakes a 9/10. They are amazingly fresh, soft (but not too soft), and DELICIOUS! You an tell they are made with love. Friendly staff. Can't wait to go back and try more flavors! We had cherry and the awesome apple pie crunch!"
2,"Update: Sadly, picking up the pizza in person doesn't seem to have much of an effect on how done it is. I don't know what changed over there, but the pizza they're putting out now just isn't doing it for me. Too bad, especially since I can't even get the stoners at Hot Box to deliver the right pizza at all (or to deliver the right one after I call to complain (or to credit my account when that one doesn't show up either))."
4,my new go to spot to impress visitors. amazingly unique drinks and the feel is right on target with prohibition. so fun!
4,"The food here is truly delicious! Everything always tastes so fresh and homemade. My favorite sandwich has to be the BBQ Chicken and my Fave soup is the tomato bisque. Everything is super delicious though! The service is also very great, they are always friendly. It's hard finding a good place to eat in town that has good service as well. This place is truly a Gem. Thank you Süp! I truly appreciate the great food and service!"
0,"While I was there, the phone kept ringing and ringing, and the employees would not answer it.
Then, I was overcharged for my order and when I confronted the cashier, I was told that the prices on the signs aren't correct but they cant take them down. Huh????
This place should just close. There are so many other great places in the area to get breakfast and/or lunch."
3,"I was pleasantly surprised by the flavor fullness and freshness taste of the food. Initially, I was skeptical due to the menu choices and prices, but I can honestly say everything we ordered was great and worth the cost. The only thing I could really say that needs improvement is the seating. It's a nice restaurant with nice decorum but the seating seems like cheap diner furniture and not very comfortable."
3,"Excellent menu and they let you check in online to get a jump on  the usual wait times. Avocado toast is really good but small. Liked that I could get a side of sausage gravy ( wanted to try it before committing to the whole order) you could pas on the sausage gravy, it's ok but nothing special. I wasn't that hungry coming here, but wish I was. Lots of good things on the menu."
4,"Went over Labor Day weekend. I had biscuits and gravy, wife had shrimp and grits. She said it was the best shrimp and grits she has ever had. My briskets and gravy had great flavor. We also had a single brisket with jelly it was a a good brisket. Briskets and good not a flakey but are good. This is a small restaurant be prepared not to have a seat available."
4,"Excellent service!  Honest evaluation.  Wonderful estate jewelry for purchase.  It is my new ""go to"" store for great service"
4,"Make reservations if you can, because even if relatively new, this place gets full! Luckily we were kinda early so we were able to get dinner. Their Mac n' Cheese is super good, and so is the brussels sprouts salad. Will definitely go back to try more of the menu!

Updated Aug 2019: went there for Burger Week and OMGGGG they had the bestttt burger everrrr!!! And their truffle mayo parmesan fries are amazing too. DEFINITELY coming back for more burgers and also want to try out their brunch!"
1,"I'll give this 2 stars because the wine was good - HOWEVER, you could've knocked me over with a feather when I received my bill for $167 for 4 glasses of wine, a salad and a hummus appetizer! My husband's red glass of wine was $35 each x 2 - my glass of wine was $24 each x 2 - when I saw the menu, I assumed the $35 & $24 prices were for the BOTTLE! Stupid me! Quickest and most terrible $200 ever spent!"
4,"Jersey mikes is easily my favorite place to get food. I order the giant club sub to split and am happily content once I finish. There are so many choices for sandwiches, they also have salads. I highly recommend the rosemary bread as it is a great addition to any sandwich. I'm also pleased with the amount of meat they put on the subs, especially compared to subway. I feel as though it's a good amount of bang for your buck."
4,"Love it!, My good friend Cory showed me this place. He owns Off Whyte Tattoos just up the street a few blocks east. I first found out when he had a solo acoustic show there one night and since has played many times. Love the ""nut so crazy and dragon eyes Rolls"" they are dynamite! Also the owner and staff are really nice. I was there when they had a staff party one night and they get pretty intense with that Karaoke hahaha"
4,"Travis took my buddy and our two girlfriends out for a half day trip. We ended staying out a bit later to do some swimming and extra fishing. I'd go out there again just to drink beer and enjoy the wonderful scenery of Percy Priest. Travis is a great fisherman and even better company. We caught one Striper, and another handful of beautiful hybrids. If you want to have fun and catch fish, Travis is your guy! I will definitely be back each time I'm in Nashville."
0,The food was good until I saw a huge rat (or two) scary across the floor where the cooks were. Hell no!
1,"Great place to watch baseball or to eat outside.  

Food was just OK though.  Wings were undercooked and soggy which is kind of an instant turnoff.  Our service wasn't too good, but I think it was waitress specific, as other tables seemed to see their servers much more frequently.  Wasn't able to get a drink refill at all, or the check in a reasonable time."
1,"I had a 11:20 appointment at the Murfreesboro location and got out of there at 12:45.  How can they not plan their schedule better?  How hard is it?  When the appointment was nearly done they said, ""you want us to trim the hair around his eyes"" and I said ""sure"".  Thanks for not informing me that was another $15 when I told them I have a grooming appointment in two days.  Next time I will drive all the way to Nashville and hope for better service."
4,Yum!! Talk about unique flavors and they're all delicious! I'm still trying to figure out how I can try everything they have! When they say the best things come in small packages....I'm pretty sure they were talking about Sips :)
4,"This store is a dream come true. The girls working were so friendly and helpful, and even suggested pairing scents which is a great idea. I left with a jar of my favorite 'Hawaiian Lei' as well as a bottle of the essential oils for my reed diffusers at home! Yes, they sell that too. All the scents were so different from classics like pine or cotton to ingenious ones like leather or whiskey. I cannot wait to go back."
4,"Yummy.

In this age of convenience and immediacy, I am a big fan of places that do one thing, one thing only, extremely well. Las Paletas serves...paletas.

Amazing Mexican frozen treats made from fruits, chocolate, cream, and sometimes even tea. I go for the fruit flavors, especially on hot days. I've fallen in love with plum and grapefruit. If you're feeling really adventurous, go for chile pineapple, or chile mango."
1,"Highly disappointed, had to wait to be seated in a half empty restaurant. Overcharged for a child. To be honest aside from a couple of the meats the rest was highly overrated. Had better service and meal from sizzler at a lot better price... just saying"
4,"Best Asian Buffet in Tucson, good sushi, crablegs on the weekends and everything has been fresh every time we have been"
3,Best kimchi jjigae and japchae in Arizona. PERIOD! They're bonchon (side dishes) are also house made and super delicious!
4,Great selection of current and back issues.  Very friendly staff.  Would visit again when back in town.
4,"Margaritas is our most favorite restaurant on the Southside! Can't beat the Monster, fishbowl Margaritas. Food quality and service is outstanding! We always ask for Juan, he is our favorite server!"
4,Amazing venue for a night out in Nashville. The night started with great music from Residency act Nathan Belt and the Buckles...great name btw. We had some awesome cocktails and had the pork belly tacos to start. We then had the Nashville hot chicken and the ribs which were both fantastic. The next band to play was amazing and it was just a great environment to listen to some music and have a great meal.
4,"Thank you for working so hard to keep us in healthy food and great curbside service with a smile. We miss looking at the many choices in the store, but your recommendations are wonderful! 

I highly recommend Everest & Kuteer for great family groceries and more!"
0,This location ALWAYS has obnoxious wait times even in off peak times. Go in tonight at 8pm and a table for 2 is an hour and a half? Are you kidding me! Bar tables and bar itself completely empty....Nope they don't even let you sit at the bar now. I never liked this location and I'll be sure to steer clear in the future too. I'll travel further to avoid.
3,"We've been back several times since our first visit and have enjoyed it each time. 

Hubby keeps experimenting with dishes to see if they have something too hot for him, but he hasn't found anything yet. But everything he's tried has been delicious. I've not ventured beyond the sour cream enchiladas because they are so good.

Service has always been great and the food comes quickly.  I can see why this place has been here so long. Stupid of us not to have stopped here long before we did!"
4,"Our favorite stop in Philly. Long waits on weekends, but well worth it if you have the time. The fact that they are BYOB and serve breakfast all day are huge bonuses. Stuffed French Toast is amazing."
3,"Great place in east Nashville.  Isolated little spot with amazing food.  We had the crab hush puppies, salmon burger and salmon filet.  The menu changes by season, and we had the fall menu.  Everything was amazing.  Located in a little house"
0,"""Eh"" is one word I would use to describe this place. My burger was less than I was anticipating in flavor, juiciness and was honestly pretty dry. The fries were soggy and limp."
4,My hair turned out beautiful and full of shine. It started to rain right after my appt but my hair held up and I have naturally very curly hair.  It has been super easy to flat iron. I am a happy customer.
2,"Depends on the terminal, and if you end up in the wrong one you're doing a lot of walking.  If you're here to shop, you're in for a treat.  I'm not.

Food choices are okay, but I'd expect more and better in Philly.  No Starbucks - Au Bon Pain all over the place."
4,"The food is GREAT however, I expected a huge portion with the high prices and was surprised to find the portions were small. It ended up being very expensive and we left still hungry but the flavor of the food is great. Will definitely come back sometime, but probably only on a special occasion because it's too expensive."
4,"Food was great, priced right and Tyler was the best server we've had in a long time.  The food was great and the price is right!"
4,Sooooo delicious!! We eat here every time we visit Philly. Jonathan was an excellent server and so attentive. This place never fails to excel!
3,"90s COLLEGE STONER FOOD. That's what Phat Bites is to me, and I'm completely fine with that. Huge portions, perfect when you want to munch on some serious grindage buh-ddy.  While your at it, weez the fresh squeezed juice. Staff is very friendly, food is made to order so be prepared to wait a little."
2,"The hype of this place is the live music, but it doesn't really live up to it. Add to that the 'meh' food, small portions, and extreme prices, and you can skip this joint for a better place."
4,"Stopped in headed to Solvang - super easy to miss because it's in Mackenzie's and the set-up is a little non-cohesive, but the gyro was amazing! The flatbread was fresh and all the ingredients tasted fresh and delicious. Friendly owner, wish I lived closer!!"
4,"I rarely write reviews but this place is great and they are open for Take-Out during this crisis.
The staff is so accommodating always and the food is great.  In this time when so many places are closed, ECW is doing a tremendous job. 
In addition they are staying open late - 10pm.
I consider myself a Wings expert.
Love the Wings and their entire menu!  Thumbs way up! We need to support this place!"
4,"Brussels sprouts and chicharones were pretty awesome to start. My wife loved the crab cake sandwich, and I finished the whole po' boy though I planned to save some of that huge thing for lunch tomorrow. Great music, great atmosphere! We'll be back often!"
3,"Awesome to see this in the area .

They need to get better at cleaning the tables and common areas.

Customers need to figure out you stand in line, order, wait for food, get food, sit down eat then leave.

Don't send 1/2 your party to find a table and hog the tables while you do everything to get your food.

This is a place to go and eat quickly and leave. Maybe the typical Hoosier will figure this out when the novelty wears off."
3,"Loved the location and at a good price point for what you get.  Has a wine store, restaurant, bar, gym, and spa which was very nice to have access to.  You can rent bikes and scooters to get around to all the local bars, restaurants, entertainment, and shops.  The walls are thin and I didn't care for the housekeeper coming to the door asking when we were checking out in the morning when the check out time was noon.  Loved the complimentary glass of wine when checking in.  The food at their restaurant was very good, but small portions.  We would definitely return."
2,"Not bad, but not the best.  Thing is, Oklahoma is a little far off!!  (They have one of the best Italian Chef's who opened his own restaurant and it was AMAZING!!!  Sorry, Boise!"
4,"I love this minimal, modern coffee stand. Simple menu but  offered alternative macadamia nut milk. Our drinks were delicious. The barista was sweet and the ambience was relaxing.  There wasn't very many customers. I hope more people come here and support such a cute local small business."
3,"Good food, good people. 

A bit pricey but it's worth it."
4,"New small local place, Chipotle style. A ton off toppings they have homemade pickles and sauces. Not expensive and really fresh. Really good burger."
4,"Two of us came in at 1:45an for brunch. The wait was 15 minutes. We sat at the counter. The wait staff was a hoot. 
The vegetarian with me had waffles I had an egg white omelet. The food was great it arrived not fast but quick enough. The place was jamming until 12:45 when tables started to open up. 
The only downside is no Maple Syrup."
4,"I've been waiting for this establishment to open up ever since they put up the sign since i work right across from it i was super excited. Finally got to try their food today, I loved my California burrito. It had the right amount of ingredients. I cant wait to go back and try more things. Thank you for bringing much needed Mexican food to this neighborhood."
4,Great job on my. Cadillac. Best place to get your car repaired. You should give them your. Business
4,"Great place for food, drinks, and live music. We had the best shrimp and grits and pulled pork po boy here. Tried the crawfish and alligator bites too which were delicious! Service was wonderful. Really enjoyed the southern peach drink. Excellent live jazz! Had a great evening here! Would go back in a heartbeat!"
3,"SO we do not get to spend a ton of time in these terminals as we are either on our way to get a patient or have one with us.....  

That being said, this particular Atlantic is super comfortable with a friendly,a accommodating staff. The bathrooms are spotless as well. Not much more you could want"
0,Totally old facility .. Come on LA Fitness .. Open one here already
3,"Good seafood, which is not easy to find in Nashville. Big,open place--not warm and cozy. Waiters were helpful. Brunch is good. Enjoy."
3,Enjoyed the food and atmosphere.   Apps were great and the service was good.  Had the shrimp and grits.  Really goid
3,"I absolutely love this place my family and I eat here all the time and the food is delicious however, for the first time our three number 2 combos weren't fully cooked. I was disappointed, but I know how busy this place is. I know next time we go it'll be better."
3,"Very nice little place to have brunch! The food was great, and they have amazing detailed choices on the menu! The only thing that I wish were different, is the awkward size of the menu and plates, they were too big for our small table and didn't leave much extra space."
1,Been here a few times but it's really gone downhill of late. From having to ask for silverware to the bartender talking so loud I had to ask my lunch companion to speak up it is just not worth it anymore. It's s shame now we have to find a new lunch spot.
4,"2700's staff is super responsive, helpful and kind, the amenities are amazing and the community-building activities are thoughtful and fun! The floor plans are very spacious and open and the tall ceilings are a huge plus. We also love all the added security features. My husband and I have really enjoyed calling 2700 our home for the past few months and we would recommend to anyone."
4,Theses guys are great / had a leak due to missing shingle from storm - called them in the morning and they were at my house by 11 am - fixed the missing shingle with light rain still coming down - tech that did the repair were very friendly - thanks for the quick fix!
4,So yummy. Can you please add cream cheese to the poke bowl toppings... so much better that miso hungry. Fresh fish. Salmon is my go to
4,"The food is delicious. We've been a few times, my favorite is fried chicken .. it is the best I've had...with white rice and beans .. and plantains. It is also very affordable. We always have left overs."
1,I would try again but I can't have bell peppers and asked that they not be added to my lunch special - they were anyways.  My curry was so sweet it felt more like eating dessert than red curry.
4,"Neat little joint just enough out of the noise of center city. It's quiet, the service is quick, and the drinks are fab. It's intimate and easy going; perfect for socializing and perhaps meeting someone new. Sidewalk dining gets 5 stars too."
3,"Sometimes your dining experience is made by the person who serves you, as in this case. Great experience here on Sunday by our server John C, he was fast, friendly and efficient. Food was typical Red Lobster seafood, really nothing outstanding but was good n fresh. 
Only negative, when we checked the app before we got there it said 15 minute wait. Actually when we got there not five minutes later, we were told an hour......."
4,"We love Capriottis, and I have to say the service we got at Capriottis in Sparks today was probably the best and most friendly service we've ever had at a fast food restaurant."
4,"I can't say enough good things about this place! Very delicious food, great ambiance, and friendly service. I enjoyed the chicken kabab and my colleague loved her seafood paella. Make sure you try the mint atay tea if you want an authentic tasty of Morocco!"
4,My favorite taco place in this area! The food is great and reasonably priced and the workers are always friendly.
3,"The kale salad was awesome! Decent craft beer selection, good service. Will be back!

Service was a little slower than I expected."
3,"Good local hoagie shop! No real complaints, and it comes in handy for a quick lunch. I have really high hoagie standards growing up in south Jersey, and Primos is usually a good choice!"
3,"Fun decor, but a little noisy. Delicious pizza and complementary toffee. The breadsticks are delicious!"
1,Just tried to go here. Hours on window say they would be open. No signage posted they are closed
4,Breakfast perfection. It is not a traditional breakfast place but what they have is very exciting. The huevos rancheros were out of this world and the avocado mash that came with a bagel was heavenly. The other plates going to other tables also looked scrumptious. Especially the French toast. I highly recommend
1,"My wife and I went here since it was so close to our hotel but found that the food did not meet our expectations.  The service was okay but the food was bland, oily and though we did not order two sticks of butter, our food tasted like it anyway.

Also, the only other people inside were 2-3 detectives which would ordinarily make you feel comforted but, not these guys.  They reminded me of the crooked cops from the movie, ""The Big Easy"" with Ellen Barkin."
4,Fills me up easily. The workers are nice and the location complements the place nicely.
3,"First time eating here, and the service was outstanding. While I did enjoy the bacon, egg and cheese sandwich, the hash browns were meh. The restaurant has such a very nice homey feeling to it."
4,Best Mexican food in town.   It's my goto place to eat.   Excellent service as well.  Clean and friendly.
2,Great cappuccino. Although my wet cappuccino and my husband's dry cappuccino came out exactly the same.  The coffee itself had good flavor. Cute mid-town location.  It would be nice if there were better menu signs.   But overall a nice cup of coffee.
4,"Definitely my new favorite Asian Cuisine spot. Modern atmosphere, great service and best of all a diverse Asian menu; had the Kimchi Fried Rice and was stuffed! Price is on par and competitive without the usual over-pricing. Looking forward to going back for more."
3,"We never venture far from Carmel, but came here for date night. The drinks were okay... but the small plates (beets/broccoli) and roasted half chicken were fantastic! Very convenient free parking lot in the back so you dont have to deal with Mass Ave!"
4,"This is my wife and I new go to sushi place! There so many sushi restaurants in Reno but this one takes the cake for us! Never been disappointed, the fish is so fresh, great menu and good prices. Very friendly staff and the homemade ice cream is a bonus!"
4,Best burgers I've ever had. I have burgers of the month that I literally dream about. Staff is always super friendly and actually take the time to connect with you. Love when they give recommendations for new music to listen to (especially new local bands). Would give more than 5 stars if I could. Don't change a thing
0,I went for my annual visit and waited for an hour to be seen then they refused to let me just walk in and pick up my samples.  If you work normal hours (8am-5pm) be prepared to have to wait at at least a month for an appointment. I have been going to the Eye Dr's of New Tampa for years and this was the last time I'll be there.
4,"I can't say enough amazing things about Irene's. Just go experience it- literally you will understand why this is so short. The best service, food, atmosphere that I have ever experienced. And get seated in Daniels section- he is the best server ever. Just go book now..... and get the lamb chops"
4,Can't say enough about the variety and service in this shop. When I pass through the pearly gates I'm  pretty sure this place will be one of my regular hangouts.  Keep up the great work Wedge.
0,"These guys are the rudest barbers I've ever dealt with. They have an attitude and are just difficult to deal with in so many aspects. And seriously, They think they're brain surgeons or something. You're a fkin barber. Act like it. 

Their buzz cut is $25 which is a total rip off imho. You can get far superior service and treatment at other salons for a similar price.  I strongly encourage you to look elsewhere!"
0,We had to wait 10 minutes for them toTake our drink order then took another 20 minutes for our waitress to come to take our food order we ordered gumbo and a burger and they forgot about the gumbo so then when it did come out it was cold after our burger came out
4,This is my wife's favorite place! Their cinnamon rolls are so light and delicious. The tiny donuts with jam are heavenly - can't wait to try everything!
1,"Sad to say it's not very good. The crab cake rueben was gross. The crab cake sandwich was average at best. The Caribbean Jerk chicken wrap tasted bad. However the pizza was not bad. Seemed like a frozen pizza with extra cheese added. Still compared to everything else it was ok. Easy to fall in to the ""trap"" because it looks fun but it is all show and no go when it comes to quality."
0,Wanted to move back to Tucson.. I remember this as a great place to live years ago.. Now they charge for everything that should be included.No thanks I will remain in Phoenix.
0,This Sharkey's will go under just like all of the others.  Their business plan sucks!  Overpriced haircuts leads to under-staffing which leads to unsatisfied customers.  They have one girl working the week before school starts and they charge over $20 including tip.  Don't waste your time.  Stick with Hair Cuttery or somewhere that knows how to run a business and charge a respectable price for a little boys haircut.
3,"This place was awesome, best oysters in town! Try the oyster loaf, it's basically a whole loaf of bunny bread with fried oysters on it! Would give this place 5 stars if it was open more than 3 days a week for dinner. If that changes, I will immediately update this to a 5 star review."
0,Would give no stars if possible.. Me and my husband went to this dealership looking to purchase a new car walked around for about 15-20 min not one sales rep came out and asked to assist us mind you my husband is black .. 2 white women came up as we were leaving and all the sales reps then came out asking if they need assistance while still not even acknowledging we were there.. racism at its finest.. highly disappointed.
3,"They have a really good Brooklyn pie.  We order it, for pick up, at least once a month.  The pie is thin, sauce sweet, and it just the right amount of mozzarella and basil.
I honestly have never tried anything else from this restaurant, nor have I ever eaten in.  However, I can say, if you are looking for a good take out Brooklyn pie, to drink a glass of wine with at home, in front of the fire, look no more."
4,"Thanks to Adam for helping out our riding club, The Rig Riders and hosting our silent auction to raise money to go towards an injured oilfield worker. 

Shout out to Whiskey For The Pain... I you ever need an awesome band, then this is the one for you! They are dialed in :)"
2,"Decent pizza, never very fast, won't deliver to my house Less than 2 miles away. Don't really like how you can see the staff playing around and hear them using foul language while waiting for food"
2,"Decent Mexican food, but everything but the fajitas lacks flavor and seasoning. Tacos and burritos are boring. The rice and beans are bland. Chips and salsa are excellent though."
4,"One of my favorite hangout spots in Philly!  Been coming here since 2 years ago. 

Some nights it can get very crowded, but we never had trouble finding a table.  There is no hostess, so seat yourself.  A bouncer is at the door, so have your ID ready. 

My usual is the Turkey Reuben. Good selection of beers. Love the cheap prices."
3,"Very chill, outstanding muffins.  French roast was a little on the weak side. But great place."
4,"What a wonderful addition to Phoenixville!  Chikara Sushi is one of the best sushi restaurants we've visited!  Among the best we've eaten at in San Francisco, Honolulu, Phoenix, Philly and New York City.  

The service was friendly and professional.  The Sake was a nice addition. Ambiance was modern and inviting.

As we say in Hawaii 'broke da mouth' delicious!

It's a keeper!!!"
3,Whole Paycheck. Gotta love it. I grab a bite here from time to time when in the area. Good sushi.
4,"Great place and great food. All of the staff was very nice and the place was pretty clean. My wife and I received our food in a very reasonable time and the portions are big enough for seconds. This was our 1st time dining at Tuk Tuk, but surely not our last."
0,"I was scheduled for an appointment at 4pm, and was greeted by a nice person but my stylist Jonathan did not take me back until 4:30. I specifically asked for a graduated cut, which instead I came out looking like the dude from no country for old men.. To give a better visual, Johnny Depp from Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. $55 down the drain and I look like an idiot."
2,"Bridesmaid party? Make sure the bride-to-be rides the mechanical bull. (Hint: if you tip well, she'll be able to hold on for 8 sec).The club area is HOT as in uncomfortably hot, but it's loaded with people so expect to be hit on. No one is dancing well, so you can get your goofy groove on and no one will care."
4,Caitlin is a wonderful wonderful angel of a server. We have a large (15+) group of people that make an annual journey Indy to catch up and eat good food. Caitlin flawlessly handles anything we throw at her each year with a great attitude and impeccable accuracy. Jack helped us out this year as well and matched the level of hospitality that the Mikado staff has shown us year after year. Caitlin and Jack are the reason a made a Yelp account and they deserve whatever good fortune comes their way. Came for the sushi stayed for the service.
4,"Wow, what a great find.  Short drive from Yardley and well worth it.  Such an interesting menu. Not the usual breakfast or brunch items; but rather with an added flavor twist..... The secret is in the ingredients.

My wife and I share a salty and a sweet dish.  Omelet with Brie and mushrooms and herbs and dish two was a special crepes dish.  Both sooooo fresh.

Great service and good vibe.  Don't judge this little jewel from is exterior view."
2,"Very authentic Central American atmosphere , clean space . Nice staff , very family oriented . Sometimes can be loud due to the television showing Spanish shows . The food is excellent , lot of food for small amount of money . The main thing to try is the traditional pupusas , I would recommend loroco , and chicken . Be prepare , is high in carbs and fat , definitely not appropriate if you are ok diet , but is worth every calorie ."
2,Went there and 1 oven was broke so it took awhile to get my sandwich. Then they forgot to give me the cake pops that I ordered. Was a little disappointed
4,This place has great food. My wife and I had a great night out here. The tomato bisque is fantastic.
2,The biscuits and gravy are delicious and they know how to make eggs! Love this place!
4,"The vanilla-frosted cake donut blew my mind.  The generous helping of frosting tasted perfectly sweet, but the real star was the donut itself, with its crunchy exterior and moist, fluffy interior.  Based on that, I'm pretty sure if they'd had the blueberry cake donut in stock, it might have ended me.

The cinnamon crumb donut didn't quite have that same crunch when I bit into it, but I clearly would not kick it out of my donut bag.

Oh, and the smell when you walk in . . . wow."
4,"First time here after a recommendation from a friend. While variety wasn't a lot, all the food looked/smelled/seemed delicious. They also had a great selection of specials which is where I ended up ordering from: the Taco Grande Platter with Shrimp. Generous portions and great seasoning. I also had the Cadillac margarita which was very tasty! Looking forward to going back!"
4,"This beautiful studio recently reopened with new owners,  Sergey and Maria Barsukov. The studio provides warm and friendly atmosphere for students, becoming a social outlet as well as a ""happy place "" for them. 
 It doesn't matter if you are an experienced dancer or a complete beginner,  you will have a great time learning new things or getting introduced to the world of dancing!"
4,"We are from Chicago and were in STL for a game. We went to this restaurant after the game and this place is Excellent overall! Great customer service, food was amazing and prices were very reasonable! I would definitely recommend this place to everyone!"
3,Devil's a fun innovative place with mind blowing beer selection.  Can be loud for dining due to the bar area but overall great food and cool atmosphere.
3,"Brownstone started my locs back in 2006. And while I've been doing them myself for awhile, I love to treat myself & head in to get my locs done with a deep conditioning treatment.

Loc maintenance will cost you here but it's not going to be an arm & a leg-half a arm...tops. No doubt about it but I feel your getting more than you paid for getting your locs done here. From the wash to the retwist, your hair & scalp will look better after their treatment."
3,"A very very nice seafood house. Their specials are unique and we were treated with the utmost care by our waiter and the other staff members.   The seasoning and combination of sauce and spice was really the highlight for my scallop dish. Yes, I too agree that the crab cakes were an venerable palette pleaser with any dish you may order or on their own.
Hope this helps.
BO"
4,Love this place great for families love the thick crust pizza.  Try the spaghetti and meatballs pizza
3,"Just give us celery with our wings, we have asked for years. Stop being arrogant and give the people celery!!!"
0,Room sucks! Loud toilets runing making noise all night. Dirty poop left on side of toilet too. Not worth a stay. Gross!!!!
4,"Great market in the Quarter conveniently located on Royal Street, stocked with your favorite drinks and snacks to take back to your hotel. It's much larger than you think, and they carry lots of local items, too. Get some to take back to your loved ones as souvenir tastes of New Orleans for far better prices than you'd pay in a souvenir store.

Nice employees, too."
4,Sushi is amazing! It's fun and always busy. Very nice and attentive staff with quick service.
4,I love the freshly made tortillas here.  I wish I could buy more than 3 extra but they run out quickly.  I love it here especially when they have live music. Also done step foot in this place if you're not wearing eating pants... you'll need them.
3,"We went here for a date night before going to the Fox and had a really great time. The server was fantastic and really knew what she was talking about. She was very knowledgable and had good recommendations.

The atmosphere was really nice and open with a fun tropical/Hawaiian feel to it without being super loud and echoy.  They had SUPER fun drinks and very reasonably priced food, especially for seafood. Definitely recommend if you enjoy seafood, but you can find other options like chicken and beef items."
3,"Wonderful food that definitely goes beyond the normal pizza bar experience. Beautiful seating arrangements, great service, and the pizza was fantastic!!! Definitely worth the visit."
4,Excellent food and service. Owner Mike is very engaged and that is a good thing. Thanks for the good food.
4,"Here on vacation from Kentucky...this place is as good as all other reviews....great food, great service and perfect location...wifey had the kings crab legs A+, I had the blackened mahi mahi A+...and make sure you order the onion rings, another A+"
3,"Good food, service was fine and management stopped by our table to make sure everything was ok. 

I do love the wings here, but it is overall a better experience if you can come in with some NFL or college games on."
0,"Dress code for a beer garden? No ball caps, no hoodies? Are you kidding me? Good luck staying open."
3,"Wings were good, as well as the onion rings. Pretty tacky though to charge for blue cheese or ranch for dipping. 

FYI, the waitresses wear skimpy outfits. If this bothers you, pick a different place to go."
0,"I walked in to pick up a quick pastry, viewed numerous flies landing on the baked goods, and called the clerk over to show her. She said something to the effect of, we do the best we can, they come in the door when it opens.  I walked out."
0,"Food - good but overpriced for pasta.
Service - Awful !!!!
Music (Cleo) Good. but way too loud
Parking was a nitmare. So used ""free"" valet ($5 tip)"
4,We just had a difficult move which could only be completed by pros who know the intricacies of big city moving. We are more than impressed by their ability to handle fine furniture and the demanding management of a high rise. Thanks Dan!
4,This place could be better if Puff and Stuff was here.  George is an awesome chef.  Great Bartenders.
4,"New Orleans style - the bread makes the sandwich. And it's so rare you find a sandwich shop with great bread. You want local stuff? Order a side of Billy Goat chips or Fitz soda/local brews (I didn't catch the breweries). The service here is amazing. Everyone I encountered was kind with an extra helping with sweet. Plus, you can listen to great tunes while you eat. Wonderful restaurant."
3,Family of 6 can squeeze into one room so its a good value.  Nice place.  The front desk folks were so friendly and helpful.
4,"The perfect breakfast place.  Family loved it.  Had French toast, sausage and orange juice - all terrific.   Prices were great too."
2,"Very solid three star ""order at the counter and they'll bring it to the table"" diner. The menu is huge with a great selection for breakfast especially. You need to know what you want quickly as there is usually a line that forms from the counter to the door. Service is fast and efficient.
In comparison to other places the Greek Gyros is just average."
4,"Great lunch experience! The place was packed so I was concerned- but it was great. We had excellent service from our server, Natasha, and the manager came over to say hello. The food was amazing and I even asked for a bread basket after our food was out and it came out very quickly. 2 thumbs up and I will be back!"
3,"Convenience 5 stars, interior smoke odor negative 5 stars. I typically go through the drive thru and keep it moving as the inside reeks of smoke and it's just not how I prefer to enjoy my daiquiri. They have daily specials with Sunday being gallon day as well as a full bar. There are several daiquiri shops throughout the city, so when in town why not"
3,"Pretty good Korean BBQ.  The spicy pork is excellent, and all the other meat choices are seasoned well.  In some regards, it's actually better than having a grill at the table.  The meat is always cooked just the right amount this way, plus it comes out rapidly and still sizzling on their cast iron grill pans.  It's not the traditional way, so there's something lost there, but I'm happy the food here is always worth eating."
3,"UPDATE: I just ate here today and ordered the Wild Mushroom Linguine Pasta... FIVE STARS!!! It was delicious. Don't bother getting garlic bread though - it's not very good. Try this pasta. You won't regret it!



I can't ever get enough pasta or pizza. They have awesome fried Calamari too, by the way. The food is great, but since I work around the corner I can't say anything about the staff since I only order to take out. Can't go wrong with this place."
4,I haven't been here in so long I really miss this place everywhere else o go for my pho is just very disappointing. Best Vietnamese place
0,I've never eaten here before but I made a reservation weeks before for 6:45 and we were seated at 7:27. We got water at 7:38 but didn't get menus. We menus at 7:40 and we got served soon after that and the waiter was super nice. Got food at 8:20. The food was okay but they lost my card for a moment. I would only go during  a non-busy  time like a Thursday morning if at all. Because clearly the can't handle crowds. This was the worst restaurant experience of my life.
4,"Absolutely amazing. I loved their sobro skillet so much! The decor isn't lovely, it looks quite outdated. But I would definitely go back."
0,"Both the security guard that you have to walk past to get into the store and the pharmacist were completely unmasked this morning, in violation of both the St. Louis City mask mandate and Walgreens' corporate policy. This is now the second time I have experienced this. The first time Walgreens corporate said that they had reached out to the store and addressed the issue. Apparently not.  Customers should be able to expect that when they go to a pharmacy they will not be put at risk for getting COVID."
3,We heard this was a famous hole in the wall that's been around since foreverrrrr. Definitely had to check it out. CASH ONLY. Line was out the door. We shared a broken heart sundae & a scoop of peach ice cream on a cone. It was really good but too pricey for ice cream! I'd probably visit again if I feel like treating myself xD
3,"Best gluten free crust hands down! Real food, fantastic flavor. You can't go wrong here."
0,"I've just waited an hour and three quarters to see the doctor having driven down from Santa Ynez, only to have to walk out unseen and drive the 45 mins home having wasted all that time. 

I waited so long because they prioritize people who make appointments and they were booked out all day when I arrived. Why do they call themselves an urgent care provider when they act like a family medical centre???! They should be prioritizing people who walk in of the street, that's the whole point of urgent care!!!"
4,Great food great customer service great atmosphere. Everything is made in house. They make them and freeze them for you ro take home and cook later. I've had everyone of the meat pies and I love them all. Just let them cool a little bit and enjoy the flavor. And don't get me started on the awesome fudge. All hand made melts in your mouth. You will definitely want more. And want to keep trying more flavors. Just a great family owned and friendly place. They really go out of their why to make sure the customer is satisfied with every visit.
2,"Not quite as good as the Lemmon Valley location, but still fast and cheap.  I got the Honey Garlic Chicken again and it was a bit on the chewy side.  They use larger pieces of veggies, which I didn't mind, but my daughter (the picky one) could easily pick it out.  At the other location it was more cooked in and she actually ate all of it.  Still, this place is closer to home and we will likely try it again."
4,"Dutch Bros. is finally here in Reno..Customer service is on point and so is their Coffee. The employees are always friendly and nice, will always make sure you love your drink. Keep up the great work!"
4,"Fast, fabulously efficient and personable. Thank you for the wonderful experience in re-certifying my Medical Marijuana card."
1,Ok so I came for my birthday with a client. The place is beautiful and super hip.  The prices were fair for me but I from LA so they might see high to others.  The food was super marginal.  I would come back for drinks at the bar but no more food for me....
4,"The service was amazing. Everyone was super friendly. The restaurant was super clean, and even during this pandemic they were cleaning tables between guests. The food was amazing and tasted great! Literally, fresh! I got a bowl with rice and potatoes, green beans and broccoli with teriyaki chicken. the sodas are good too! All around great and I for sure will return."
4,Lick is the finest ice cream shop in Indy! All their flavors are incredibly interesting and their commitment to quality is obvious. I have had a fantastic experience every time and I am extremely pleased to be supporting a local Indianapolis business!
1,The restaurant was dirty and hot when we came in. At 7:30 on a Friday night. I just can't get past a dirty table that I didn't want to put my forearms on. Food was so-so. Service was so-so. Disappointed Won't be back. After living in China it's hard to find good Chinese food anywhere. I should stay home and cook my own.
1,"If you are looking for a good spot to go bowling, this is definately not the spot. Lanes are not kept in top shape and neither are the balls. I'm not too concerned with the balls bc I have my own, but I did have to use it once and felt as if my fingers were going to be cut up because the ball was chipped in so many places. 

As for the food, I thought it was decent. They have really unusual stuff here which I like, but it is very expensive!"
4,Just went here for some local beer with my wife on a Sunday afternoon. Pretty good selection of beers and the flights were $11 for 5 4 oz. pours.
4,"Went here for Crawfish Festival, Crawfish not really my thing, too much work for little bit of meat but was excellent.Most important was the MUSIC, was AWESOME!! People there could not have been more hospitable plus raised $$$ for Shorty Foundation and Anders Osborne.. GREAT day of food, drink, MUSIC!! Hope they do next year!!"
4,"Frontier airlines has true airbus service from Trenton to places warmer.  If your looking for extra room, a special meal, white glove service.  Go somewhere else. Pay, ride, come back, super cheep."
1,Clams are very bad extremely large and cooked to rubber .. two stars for the garlic knot
0,"The worst customer experience ever had,Beware the quality of furniture is the worst had purchased a sofa ,loveseat when you sit on it the cushion sinks down so much feels like your or the floor very uncomfortable they offered me upgraded cushions at a cost ,after spending around 3k that was a joke and then they offered a reselect at a 40% restocking after spending thousands of dollars over the years with them I will never go back after this ,they are way over priced for the crap they sell!!!"
4,"This was my first time at Wishbone, and I was so impressed.  The food and desserts were awesome!  Homemade SNAP beverages were so tasty.  Comfort food without the heavy feeling.  Definitely a great place to check out!"
4,Came here from Seattle and was told to stop in and eat here. The wait staff and owner were extremely nice and on top of their service. The food was superb from the bread and butter all the way to the desserts. You MUST try the apple bread pudding! It's the owners recipe and she has it nailed down! Will definitely eat here again and will highly recommend this establishment to my friends and family who visit Boise.
4,I decided to stop in as we have just purchased our first motorcycle and had no clue what gear was needed. Sean was incredibly accommodating on teaching the ins and outs of everything from the helmet specs to what kind of boots are best for what we need. Some of the best customer service I have ever received in a retail setting! We will definitely be back for any of our motorcycle needs and questions.
1,"Like there food but portion, price and service suck. Don't sit outside unless u want to be forgot about and your food an hour later. This has happened numerous times I keep going back cause I can sit outside with my dog and its in my neighborhood. Mind blowing how this hasn't changed over time."
3,"My favorite place to get Indian food back when I was in UCSB. Walkable distance, serves boba, a change from burgers/burritos. I'm overly sensitive to spicy foods but Naan Stop's Chicken Tikka Masala works for me! Delicious when they pour extra sauce all over the rice too. Be sure to dip naan bread in the sauce. Masala, vegetable rice, and naan forever."
4,"Amazing food, great ambiance, and good service! Would definitely go back. Great place for a romantic dinner or small group dinner."
3,"This is a very interesting German restaurant. The menu has a lot of choices on it, much more than sausages. They also have tofu sausage. When I went the place was packed. You could hardly move through the restaurant because of how the tables were arranged. Our food took about 45 minutes."
1,"I did love this place, but after several times of not getting what I ordered, I gave up. I feel like they just give you what they have cooked up at the time. My fiancé asked why I always ordered the Garlic Chicken, and the answer is, ""Because I haven't gotten the same thing twice!"" I have gotten chicken several different ways, beef, and even shrimp all when I ordered the Garlic Chicken ‍ So I quit. Sometimes I really do just want what I ordered."
0,The place was dirty.  Our table was disgusting.  The floor had food all over it and silverware.  The service was slow and the food was WAY overpriced for the low quality.
3,This was my first experience with this company and it was amazing. First to start off they beat Safelite's price by half and with similar warranty. Scheduling was easy and the location was convenient. Would definitely recommend them for glass repair on your vehicles.
4,"Come hungry! Their pancakes are huge! I could only eat half of the two blueberry pancakes I ordered, but they were delicious. I should have taken a clue from the guy sitting next to me who only finished half his stack as well.  Seating is first come, first serve at the counter and you are elbow-to-elbow with other guests. Worth a stop."
4,"It simply gets no better than the Palm. From the moment you walk in the door, you know you've reached a sanctuary amidst the very 'energetic' downtown. The staff is like no other restaurant staff anywhere; friendly, most helpful, engaging and hard working. You can count on the consistency of the great food. Whether you go to see or be seen, the Palm will not disappoint."
3,"52 bowling lanes, reasonable price, friendly staff.  Only problem I faced is sometime ball was getting stuck in ball return, but acceptable."
4,"Minestrone almost as good as mine, full of greasy veggies. Good service and the pasta was good too. Reasonably priced and nice wines. Would defiantly go back!"
4,EJ (sales) and Dave (finance) are true professionals.   They treated me and my family like gold.  One round of negotiation and we had a win win deal.  I Will continue To Buy cars From EJ.   Great experience! !
4,"I have thick, unruly hair. It is the queen of all frizzy hair. But Hair News does real magic on my hair.  I trust no one else but Hair News with hair!!!!"
4,"Great food and great drinks! Indoor and outdoor dining. My friend and I each got a drink, an entree and the tomato soup and it was all fantastic!"
1,"Ordered and was charged for a double rally burger with cheese. Was given a single burger without cheese. Fast, but at what cost?"
0,This place is run by crooks...
4,"This place is awesome! My wife and I moved here from Southern California and it has been a breath of fresh air. When you come to visit be sure to ask for Michael he helped us through the entire process and had us approved in less than 24 hours. There are so many great amenities here, the people are nice, it's a great place to live. Looking forward to living here for a long time!"
1,"Vanguard has good funds but try doing anything while living out of the country.
They lock me out of the website and you have to call customer service to buy or
Sell anything.
With a 14 hour time difference it's a really cumbersome ordeal to do anything In a timely fashion.
I am in the process of looking for its replacement

4,always an amazing place to shop and to find international delicious things. Love going on weekends to find some of my favorite snacks from out of the US.
3,"The community raves about this place so we decided to try it. 

Donair - awesome
Burger - meh. Frozen patty but sauce was good. 
Poutine- huge and gooey and great
Deep fried pickles - yummmmmm


Would order again but skip the burger and try something else. Upgrading to the poutine would have been enough fries for both of us. Didn't need the second order."
4,"The food here is really really good. Some highlights...

Dan Dan Noodles
Green Beans with Pork
Garlic Shrimp
Three Cup Chicken

I don't think you can go wrong with anything you order here. The service is also fast and friendly. The space/ambiance is just ok...usually very loud, very casual, but i think they are expanding soon."
1,"Update - Very unsatisfied with recent experiences here. The quality has tanked compared to past visits, and it was almost insulting that the kitchen would send out such rubbish to it's customers. The mussels are still good and the servers are still polite, but that's all I can vouch for. The beers are still expensive and the atmosphere is still loud and unpleasantly tight. 

With so many other excellent gastropubs and restaurants just blocks away, we won't be giving our money to Monk's any longer. We tried to like it but they failed to please, unfortunately."
0,The dont know how to perm hair and customer service sucks. I needed my ends cut and you would think that a hair stylist would recommend that...nope only mentioned it because i complained about how my hair turned out. Stay away!!!
3,"Visited for lunch after having dinner there several months ago. It was just as good as the dinner. The food is fresh, served hot, and always has great flavors. The sushi is on par and the curry is very good. Service is alway great too. If you like Asian food at a fair price this place is for you."
3,Love the place. What more can I say.. I love when the neighborhood businesses know their customers.
0,"I take back my earlier review.. after experiencing rude associates, calling ahead to make sure and item was in stock and driving there... and being told that they don't stock said item, then buying items and waiting twenty three minutes to be able to check out.... I won't be going back.. I'll travel to another wal-mart first. I'll go to the Northeast if I have to.

One star it way to generous."
2,A beach bar with a few fish entrees not usually found at such places. Beer prices are quite reasonable and selection good. It has a side room for dinner meetings and adequate parking.
3,This is probably the best Mongolian grill I've ever had. I'm always in search of spicy food and Khan's did not disappoint me. You get to choose between two sizes and they don't charge by weight. Fast service. Perfect place to grab a satisfying and tasty lunch in between meetings.
3,"New to me, and apparently new to Delaware! Downtown Delaware is shaping into a better new nicer environment, with things to offer, I'm
Uber excited about this place. They have a variety of food choices with different restaurants inside.  Crazy enough, I love how the restroom is setup, and really think this place was well though out! I can't wait to go back, and try all other things it has to offer!"
4,Ben was very accommodating and I loved that he came to me instead of having to take my car somewhere and wait. The inside of my car looks better than ever. I will use his service again.
3,"Food is great, setting is cool.

We have been to eat here a few times and enjoyed it each time. 

We also enjoy having a drink before a concert here.

We will keep going back."
0,I went through the drive through to order a sundae with extra pecans of which I was charged for. I get to the window and there's only a few on my sundae. I ask for more and the manager tells the employee of which was a teenager that they had already put too many on the sundae. I offered to pay for the extra of which I had already paid for. This really upset me especially looking at the sundae knowing that there were about 5 pecans on it. The manger implied that the employee had done something wrong but clearly she was in the wrong.
4,"We saw on food network a show called best thing I ever ate. They suggested the milk and cookies plate. Came with vanilla milk, 3 chocalte chip Cookeies, and a mixer beater fill of cookie dough. We got ours to go and sat outside so we didn't have to wait. But it was amazing. Warm milk and cookies and the vanilla milk was amazing! Pretty close to the best thing I ever ate...lol. Breakfast of champions!"
0,BEWARE.  Horrible service.  Dishonest culture   Company makes promises but doesn't keep them.   Owner clearly doesn't care.  He must be making tons.of money.  Because he clearly d or ant mind losing customers.
3,"Classic pizza restaurant. Cheap but very good, and fast! The atmosphere is also really cool if you wanna sit down instead of take out"
4,"Keep in mind thisis a casual country place and they don't take reservations or credit cards but the owner runs a tight ship and keeps the prices low and the place is full.  Good service, small kids can blend well with noise. It is my kids favorite place to go and our bill is never over 100 for a family of five."
0,"This place had so much potential as it looked nice, and we had a really nice andknowledgeable server. But that is where the momentum ended. First the food was below average as everything in my crab quartet was battered and deep fried. The cherry on the sundae was charging me $1 on the bill for ordering my bourbon neat. Never saw that before, and I never will again as I won't be back."
1,"The food here is ok, at best.  The prices are preposterous, almost insulting.  Actually really insulting.  

There is literally no way they can justify the prices of their food.  This is a chain restaurant.  I was literally just blown away by how expensive it was.  

My only explanation for how this place is still around is that alot of people who live in the area are morons.  Yes, anyone here who reviewed this place and didnt mention how insulting their prices are is a stone cold moron.  You deserve to have your money taken from you by this place."
3,"First time here, an the Crystal pedicure was good. Inside is very nice. I think I will be returning for my pedicures."
3,Really enjoyed this. Go with other people and share. Portions are huge. Shrimp dishes were great and spinach pie was very good. Nice bottles of wine for about $40. Nice atmosphere. Place is small. Some outdoor tables. Will be back.
0,"Slow service, crappy staff, not what it use to be. 
Asking for a name just goes to show how much the staff doesn't remember their day to day heavy tipping customers, well, fixed that pretty fast, don't mind if I do keep the extra two dollars everyday."
4,"I've visited MANY mystic shops and I have to say ... this is the most beautifully curated shop I've had the pleasure of walking into!

The exterior is very unassuming, we just so happened to notice the beaded curtain outside and it piqued my interest. 

Inside is absolutely gorgeous. The ambience, the decor,
the lovely smell of incense, and all of the unique and eye catching items in the shop made it a truly magical experience. Almost hypnotizing. I left wanting to spend more time in there.

A truly authentic experience."
4,"Lica is the best!!!
Impeccable job. Super clean environment.
The service is fast and not as painful as the other professionals that I had tried before.
She is very sweet and friendly and makes me feel very comfortable.
I totally recommend her."
4,One of the best dining experiences I have had.  Ate there pre-Covid.  The four of us shared appetizers and side dishes.  Cocktails were very good.  We each had a Strip.  Cooked to perfection.  Fantastic service and wonderful ambiance.  Can't wait to get back to Philly to dine there again.
4,"Waited for about 45 minutes but it seemed to go fast! My husband and I split the chocolate sin pancakes and the egg medley. We were so happy that we had something to offset the amazing but rich flavor of the pancakes! The other half of our party ordered the raspberry delight pancakes and again, the eggs medley. The raspberry pancakes were also delicious! Also, great service!"
0,"We ordered last night (4/20/2021) for carry out. None of the three employees in sight were wearing masks while preparing food or waiting on customers at the counter. I'm not paranoid about Covid, but it makes me feel as if they don't care about their customers' health and safety, which makes me doubt their hygiene, food handling protocol, etc. There are too many local businesses working hard to do their best in this situation to support those who are not bothering to follow simple rules like wearing a mask."
4,"My experience here has always been great.  Burgers have a great flavor, fries are fresh, and staff has been very nice.  Wish you had a location in Murfreesboro."
4,"Our go-to sushi place! We love it here. Always fresh, always busy and always eat a lot!"
4,This place is great!!!  Only been here 3 times and will be back. Tried differnet meals and always great food!! Lynn...our waitress was the best. Will be back!!
2,Service was great but the food I got was meh. I had high hopes in it being great but it just wasn't. The chicken in the orange chicken was hard in the center (which was weird) and the pork fried rice was basic. It looks like they try hard but there as something missing in making this a great meal.
1,"ordered the mega french fries with gyro meat. it was supposed to have red onion, tomatoes, feta cheese and a sauce and it came with so little of these!  what a disappointment! the fries and gyro meat were ok but without these other things -- VERY MEDIOCRE!"
4,"Needed somewhere to sleep from 6am-1pm while driving cross country. Courtney at the front desk helped us out! They were so kind, waived resort fee. Room was huge! Super clean, extra towels, amazing soft bed. We were stoked- excellent customer service, best in Reno! Next time we come through the Biggest Little city we hope to stay at this resort more than 7 hours!"
4,Great place and great service. I had oysters the last time I was there and BOY they were to die for! The bartender is from Michigan (as am I) and is super friendly. He served me beer all night and kept me laughing. I hardly remembered that I was there by myself! Love Love Love this place!!!!! Sometimes they have live music and when they do I feel as if I have hit the jackpot!
4,"THE best fish tacos in Tucson.The tacos are unique and consistently huge. The salsa bar is always stocked with awesome sauces and condiments. The prices are super cheap too. My only complaint is they are only open until 3:00pm, but other than that exploring their menu is a real treat."
4,"My favorite zoo in the world. 
Great exhibits, free entry, clean, historical,  what's not to like?

The parking is expensive,  but you can normally park free and walk.

Locals love to go in the Winter,  lots of active animals,  no crowds, plenty of heated buildings to duck into."
4,"Jason, the owner contacted me a few days ago to correct the issue. We agreed on a deal that we both felt was fair, and he asked me to give his company another chance, which I will. I have used Godby many times over the years and will hopefully continue to do so in the future."
3,I always enjoy their wings and Caesar salad.  It's great!  If you get the Outback special that comes with steak and shrimp on the Barbie consider upgrading your steak. The steak with this meal is not the best grade of steak. The shrimps are good though. Their bread is great too. I always request the honey butter spread It's delicious!!!!
4,"My husband and I had such a great time totally great price for what you get definitely going back soon  
FUN,FUN!"
3,"It's a popular BYOB local restaurant. Their food is pretty pricy but at the same time good and exciting. That's why I like it for special occasions. Their dinner is too pricy to be a regular spot, but their lunch menu is reasonably priced. Lunch and dinner menu don't have much in common. Lunch is way more casual."
3,Fast service here! My daughter even broke her hat and they brought her a new one without even having to ask! Kudos! They forgot my mayo so i took a star off!
4,"Really nice place, I love taking my dog there. Place is really peaceful. Love the grasssy area to sit and relax with my dog. Great walking paths."
3,"This place used to be pizzeria uno Chicago grill which I loved. Glad it is re-opened now as the Greene turtle. Also glad they kept the exposed ceilings. They've added many TV's even in the booths, great for the game. We just stopped for drinks and apps, pics posted. The fried pickles were awesome, wings with garlic Parmesan were also excellent. The mozzarella caprese had a nice flavor, but they should be using local grown tomatoes. The bartender was really good and friendly. Definitely going back."
3,"Cool, overly hipster place with an underlying gay vibe that plays hit or miss music. The darts suck :("
0,"AWFUL. ORDERED PICK UP AND MY FOOD WAS FUCKING SOGGY. ORDERED DELIEVERY AT 12:30 said it would be here (I work literally 3 minuets from them) in an hour (which is reasonable for fresh food) IT IS 3:30 and it's still not here? Called at 2:30 said any minuet. Idk who the hell runs this place but their awful. The food is amateur and overpriced. Never ever will go back here, never will tell anyone to go here. Absolutely ridiculous."
3,"Can't beat the water-side dining here on a beautiful day. It's a seat yourself kinda place, so it took a minute for the server to see us. Food is really well priced (damn near cheap!) so it was great for the family. Hard to find a place where 4 people eat and drink (beer included) for $50. The steamed oysters were great, and priced well. The service left much to be desired,  but it was busy. We will definitely be back!"
4,Our favorite sushi place in Philly.  They treat us so well whenever we come in.  Great sushi good prices overall outstanding experience night in and night out!
4,This place is amazingggg. I love dessert and everything was so good. I've never had milk foam and this oolong tea was the best. I need to learn how to make the milk foam lol. The macaron was really good and the right amount of soft. The chocolate mousse was good. I do wish they had the mousse in a space where it'd be soft so I could eat right away. But it was good. I'd definitely come back here. Service was great too.
4,This place is awesome. They use top of line meets and all the sides are great. The restaurant is eclectic and sells many local items. If you go there you have to try the Hoshi Melt. By far this is the best sandwich that I have eaten in years.
4,"Great music, good service, awesome small plates and drinks. Perfect recipe for good times."
3,"This is my go to spot for some good authentic mexican food in South Reno. The service is quick, the staff is great, and the prices are right. 
My favorite is the flautas combo and their wet burrito. And their salsa is also my favorite for tacos.
I come here about once every 7-10 days but always forget to snap a picture because the food is immediately consumed."
4,"My husband and I love this restaurant; it is only 1 block from our house so a great neighborhood restaurant.  It has the typical pubbish aura about it with the dark wood, low lights, antiques, urban setting.  We love pubs in Europe and this makes us happy!  I love the fish and chips, so yummy.  Also love the charcuterie board!  The food is casual, comfort food, but so delicious.  We love the German beer there too and love to go to German beer gardens in Germany.  This place is delightful, highly recommend!"
1,The server was not very knowledgeable about the special drinks. I asked for less ice and still got a lot of ice. She did not listen to our order well and over charged us. When I questioned it she got defensive. Not impressed.
0,"The white lady with blonde hair was so rude, loud and unprofessional. The address to rent the trucks is wrong on the internet. The sign is hard to see to go to the other location. When I was leaving the lady was talking behind my back to the other two ladies working at the desk. Then I had to wait at the other location to get the truck. I will never rent from them again. I will go back to Uhaul!"
1,Very costly. I paid $19 for a sandwich with a cup of soup and I must say the sandwich was good but the soup was terrible. I will never go back because I feel thats a little much to charge for a sandwich. I was very disappointed in the whole experience.
0,Terrible. The worst. Don't do it. I never post but this experience was so bad that I'd like to save anyone else the trouble.
0,"Used to be my go to store, but I will never go back!! The CDC has issued it to be mandatory to wear a mask in Davidson county. However, mask wearing is not a LAW!! I will never spend a dime in a place that tells me I must wear a mask to shop in their store."
4,"Date of Tour: 18 Mar 2016.
Awesome tour!  Sandy our guide was great!  She knew the area, stories, history and company very well and would recommend her to anyone!  Probably one of the funniest guides with a great personality.  As for the areas we visited, I give a 5/5!  I'm pretty sure I captured a picture of a ghost during our first stop (3rd floor of bar)."
3,"It was a bit overpriced (but what movies aren't, nowadays?). However, the seats were comfortable and the experience was better than the other theaters I've been to in the area. From what I've been told, this is the place to go for midnight releases although we came on a Saturday night and the place was completely packed.

Overall, however, it was a good movie theater."
4,"I've been by the little area on West Street where Sabrina's is located and hadn't yet tried any of the eateries.  Fortunately, my wife and I yelp'd for a lunch spot and were drawn in to Sabrina's by the great reviews.  We had a bowl and a special tacos dish; both were amazing.  Fresh flavors, great presentation...the coconut rice was really memorable, which to me says a lot for a rice dish.  Great vibe, curated decor, and excellent music.  Happy eaters all around...we'll definitely be back."
4,"Always great service.  Love the salad dressing. We even get some to go my favorite is the steamed crab shumi, mistake roll and vege roll.  Consistent food.  By far my favorite sushi restaurant."
1,"The buffet was expensive and the food all tasted warmed up after it was cooked and sat for a while. Most people rave about endless crab legs, but I found them to be watery and without much meat"
0,"Was happy to get an appointment for my granddaughter while I was in town. We were told when we got there we'd have to wait 45 min. 2 + hours later we still had not been taken and we finally left without anything being done. The hair I saw done was lovely, but they do REALLY bad business. We will never go back! I'd leave 0 stars if I could."
4,"Went on lunch break with friend and all the pretzels were great.

Store was packed because it is on the smaller size. They had really cool drinks that I wanted to try but didn't but I'll definitely be back.

I really enjoyed my pretzel and all the choices of dipping sauces, again another reason to come back.

The hot dog was good but definitely different than what I'm use to- going to try the other one and see if that's more on my level. 

Very good- go check it out for yourselves!"
3,"Delicious pizza at a reasonable price. Wish they had drinks. We chose this truck at Girls on the Run 5k and were not disappointed! If you see this truck, stop for a slice!"
3,"Just moved to Tucson and wanted to try something different and searched this place since my wife is Italian. Let me tell you their pizza is AMAZING! The only let down was the chx parm, I ordered a full order ($17) and it seemed small for the price. Either way I will be back."
1,"The sushi was good, the drinks were ok, prices for the mixology cocktails was about average but the  volume on the small side. The burger left a lot to be desired, maybe one of our 6 person party liked their entree. I would give it another shot for brunch but not for dinner"
4,These guys are the shizz. They can fix anything you need.Be careful not to frighten the Hipster in his natural habitat and customer service should be fine.
1,Possibly the slowest service I have ever experienced.  The waitress was nice...when she was here.  Food took forever to get to us and the place was almost empty.
0,Sodas were expired! Blood stain on bathroom wall...gross! Food was ok. Service was very slow. Not coming back here ever again!
4,"I stopped in yesterday and was helped by the kindest server. I am very strict about COVID so I was happy to see at 2:30pm I was the only person in line and all proper precautions were taken. I love poke, but had never been here so she patiently walked me through options and what was most popular. The food was fresh and though at $15 the large seems expensive, it's actually the best value size in my opinion as it has twice the protein (4 full scoops) of the medium (2 scoops.) I have plenty of toppings left for lunch today!"
0,"The worst at&t location ever!!:( I waited for more than 50 minutes and I couldn't go to another location because my brother was visiting his son at UPH and didn't want to go any farther from the hospital!:( If you can, never come to this f**k location."
4,"My family and I think this is a good little diner.  Food comes out hot and fresh.  A favorite spot close to my sister in laws house. From Kansas City, wish I had a local place like this close to home!  Reasonable prices too!"
4,"This is my go-to lunch spot in UCity. While I have sampled much of the menu, I return to the baba ganooj on whole wheat pita. It is delicious, filling and vegan! The baba is especially yummy - very smokey and creamy, set off nicely by the crisp cabbage and hot sauce. Perfection in a pita!"
4,BEST no frills sandwiches prepared by great staff! Italian sandwich was great BUT the tuna is INCREDIBLE! All white meat Albacore and they don't skimp on the meat!  A plus rating!!
4,"Wow! The food was the tastiest we've had during our six-day trip in New Orleans.  Duck hash was EXCELLENT!  The daily French toast was very good.  However, PLEASE DO YOURSELF a favor and make a reservation in advance.  We waited 2 hours for a table."
1,Normally pretty good.  The cheeseburger has the smallest sliver of a patty.  The jumbo curly fries came in a large cup but they did not fill it (fries were one inch from top)..$4.59 for a jumbo fries I expected more.
1,"So I was told that this was a must see in new orleans by a local and expecting the best breakfast of my life.  I got a 3 course meal with strawberrys and cream, some omlette, and a banana fosters.  The meal in total cost almost 130 dollers for us, my gf ordered an omlette too.  

I won't complain about the food, but no breakfast is worth that much money.  waiter was boring and talked to us like we shouldn't have been eating there, and the place just looks way to beat up in the area we were sitting in.  2.5"
3,"Sea Scallops seared to perfection! The creme brulee was so tasty. Honestly, no complaints from me. Paired my meal with Moet, since the place is BYOB be prepared to bring your favorite wine/champagne to pair it with. Italian dining in a small, cute little spot. If you're thinking about skipping, DON'T. Give it a try!"
4,"I've been going to Le Reve since the day they opened! I am always greeted, and treated with so much respect and class! 

Jason does an amazing job! And always takes the time and effort to make the perfect design for you!"
0,I ordered from Uber Eats and was not delivered the right order. I called the business to see what happened and the owner hung up on me twice and was incredibly rude and unprofessional. Spend your money elsewhere if you want to be treated with respect
4,"When living in the STL area this was a favorite place to go, especially on a Summer Evening before or after going to the Muny!!! Many great memories here."
0,"If you are on the fence at all... I highly recommend not going here. If you're in concourse C and your worried about not having any options, I saw many people with gourmet kitchen around me that looked like great food and there are other places inside that will serve an obnoxiously priced adult beverage. I was very dissapointed"
4,The Kalbi is marinated perfectly here. The little sides they bring out are all amazing and the service is spot on as well! Found this little gem via Yelp and were surprised they aren't busier on a Saturday night. Also tried the bulogi bimbap and it was amazing. Everything comes out on a hot fire stone
4,Move in was easy and staff professional. Private parking and washer/dryer in unit was a big plus. Hardwood floor option is well worth it. Paying rent through an app is very convenient. Pool is well maintained. Apartment very clean prior to move in.
2,"Being from the northeast, some things just can not compare, food being one of those things!  This neighborhood take out has limited seating. The lunch specials are affordable & big enough to share!!! If you are looking for good Chinese take out, at a good price- this is it!"
2,"Hipster.Over Priced. 

BUUUUUUT..... I did have the best cocktail I've ever had there. I had the Jersey Ginger. I was hooked. The whole table had great drinks. Drinks are expensive but worth it. Food was average."
4,"We were in nawlins in March and we found Big E here on yelp about two days before we arrived....He  picked us up on time and we were very lucky to book a return pick up also...are return pick up was at 430am and he was right outside the hotel waiting for us. Very knowledgeable about the area, gave us some great suggestions on bars and restaurants.  Next trip we are def calling Big E!"
4,"This is the 2nd time I have gone to ripperts's for alterations for bridesmaids dresses and both times I have been extremely satisfied. I found Kathy to be friendly & welcoming. Above all, she did a great job on the alterations and made sure I was satisfied. I would definitely go back!"
4,"Not sure what else I can say about Amelia's amazing bread that hasn't already been said. The bread is absolutely worth falling off the low carb train.

If you want a little something to go with that carbo-load, check out the small fridge, tucked in the back corner, for great cheeses and amazing spreads. I recommend the spicy prosciutto spread, or as the employee described it to me ""spicy meat butter."""
3,Was able to get a same-day appointment. Nice cut and style. Nothing fancy. Just what I needed.
1,"Lunch was just so so.  It was quick.  The rice was very good.  The orange chicken and black pepper chicken was so so.  I would not cal this gourmet, but that's what their sign said.  Another negative point is that it was dirty.  Floors were dirty.  Trays you put your food on were dirty.  Mine felt greasy on the sides.  It appears they just take the trays and place them back out for customers without washing them."
4,I'd never been here before and was a little surprised by the atmosphere (loud--but good--hip hop music) but the sandwich I had was one of the most delicious things I've eaten in the city. I had the Grick Middle and I was blown away. Super fresh ingredients and packed with flavour. The coffee is similarly delicious! I'll be recommending this place to everyone - don't be scared away by the loud music!
3,"Much as truly authentic NYC pizza is hard to find out of NYC but is something of a commodity in the city, same thing with Philly cheeses in Philly. This place is authentic, to this out of towner its pretty much the same as a number of other places. Minus a star because they were out of small rolls on thursday, so I had to get a large, although it was delish and the leftovers made a nice snack."
3,"This place was good. The fried chicken lacked some ""herbs and spices"" but was cooked perfectly! The mashed potatoes were excellent and I loved the greens! 

Great service! Really quirky waitresses.

-JP@"
2,"Very active place with lots of outdoor seating. The service was decent and the food was okay. I had a cheese burger it was pretty good. I don't know if this would be a place I would visit regularly as the burger was good but didn't blow me over. 

It's worth a visit to check it out."
3,"Delicious food with an interesting array of sweet and savory brunch. I had fried avocado with poached eggs on a bed of creamed spinach and it was quite good. Can get a table for 2 on a Friday with no wait. My sister found a bit of an eggshell in her brunch, so watch out for that."
4,"This place NEVER disappoints! Today for lunch I decided to sit at the bar and had been craving an ice cold beer with my food, but was feeling extremely indecisive.  The bartender, Adam, helped me out and suggested a Cape May IPA -and it was gooood!  He was wonderful!  He asked me questions to figure out which beer he should suggest, and continued to check on me through out my visit and seemed to be making sure everyone at his bar was happy!  Hospitality at its finest"
3,The Sugar Bowl is great.  A little hidden if you don't know where to look.  I'm a big fan of the place.  Walked past this place like everyday going to Campus.   On my way back home I usually stopped here to chill out and just read and people watch.  And yes the Cinnamon buns are that good!!!!  Drinks are good and basically a good crowd to chill out with.
0,"Is this the worst Applebee's in America, or just the worst Applebee's in Florida? Walked in to find FOUR wait staff hanging around the front, talking and laughing. Everyone on a break? Nope. Because we sat for twenty minutes without being greeted and the staff were still hanging out. We walked out after those twenty minutes right past them, and they were too involved in their conversation to notice. Fowler Ave is full of restaurants. AVOID this one."
4,"This is the perfect spot for a great dinner with friends.  The tacos were delicious and made with completely fresh ingredients.  No alcohol served, but we brought a bottle of wine to enjoy with no corkage fee.  Sabrina's pride of ownership is evident.  Would totally recommend!"
3,My family  loves going here.  Its good Chinese food and they have very good sushi. The owner is always warm and welcoming as are the rest of the staff.  Great neighborhood restaurant.
4,"We just got our wedding video & I think we've watched it a minimum of 50 times. We are in love! Randy captured everything we were hoping he would & the edits are absolutely amazing. They've been so easy to work with & really flexible in fulfilling our requests. So, so happy we chose to have a videographer & that we wound up with this company."
3,"chicken dishes are really good. so is their spaghetti.  I would knock off half a point for not having meatballs at all though.  I like the seafood pasta as well. My wife's favorite restaurant in indy.

Also sometimes the hostess does a poor job. we've been skipped before and then given the worst table in the house on top of that. 

could use better service for the price."
4,A true traditional yet Twist of modernism. The food and curry were delicious with great consistency in the curry. I found yet no flaws in my food and the staffing was very adequate. I foresee myself coming here for Indian food again. Please do change the light bulbs as a couple of them were dull or dead.
3,"Fatboy's is a Good BBQ spot that focuses on the food instead of aesthetics . 

They have fair prices, & a very polite staff."
3,I really like going here.  Britany does such a nice job on my hair everytime.   Only down side is the price.  If I just have trim it's $40 and I'm in and out of the chair in less than 30 min.  Totally worth it for the highlights or color though.
4,So excited to have Sprouts here in Sahuarita.  Love their produce and vitamins.  Staff is always so friendly and helpful.
0,"Awful service, food was poor to mediocre.  The albacore was absolutely awful.  The tiki drinks were gross overly sweet syrup laden messes.

We will never return."
4,"Noble pie is in my mind, the premier late night pizza spot in Reno. I came here last night at 1am and they were pretty busy, I guess it's a great spot for college kids like me to go after a night out. 

We got a medium Nobleman and an order of garlic knots (highly recommend both!) with ranch on the side. I've yet to try the other locations but I'm sure I will in the near future!

This location in particular is right next to tonic and imperial so that might explain the awesome ambience last night"
4,"I admit, I didn't participate in the ropes course.  However, the middle school kids loved it!  This was their second time here... first time was in the day, this time was in the dark on the lit up course.  No one had a negative thing to say.  We will definitely be back.  The staff was great."
3,"HoneyFire is delicious, but a very specific kind of BBQ. The word ""honey"" here translates to a bit of sweetness in most of their foods and sauces. This frequently results in very delicious and unique foods. Their wings with their spicy BBQ sauce are a particular stand out. Sometime their meat quality though can be inconsistent, and in particular the pulled pork is general lacking."
4,"I never knew this place existed! Thank to my man who's knows you love  art, Greek mythology and museums! This is all of that wrapped up in one .."
0,"Got kicked out in 20 seconds from just walking in this smoke shop and asked a question to the front desk man. So he told me he can refuse service to drugs, and told me to leave. Which I never said about. I asked if he has bongs. ""Cause its a smoke shop"" he repeated and said leave. I hope it wasn't because I was a Latino man with a cap. Felt like a racist. Since I wasn't even in the store for a minute. Welp that's one less customer"
4,"This place is an absolute gem.  The food is delicious and beautifully prepared. The service is warm and friendly.

Qamara the manager is so welcoming and accommodating. My husband and I held an after-hours birthday party here and she expertly navigated us in setting up a perfect evening.

My only gripe is that I wish it were open past 8pm! Oh well, then it would be too perfect."
2,"Service was great, overall the food was decent. The duck fat tater tots were so good! 3 of us split the full order and it was more than enough. I got the pulled pork which was alright. The meat was kind of dry but the BBQ sauce was good! 

Overall I'd say the experience was good but the prices were high for the pretty average food. However, the location and proximity to bars on Broadway made it a good choice for us!"
4,Excellent pedicure for a reasonable price. Great location next to the Indigo. Down town Nashville
4,"My friend loooved her burger! I loooved my chicken salad and chili. Very polite and prompt service. Good drinks, also. Glad we chose this!"
4,"Had an excellent time at Eckert's over the weekend!  In order to go into the fields for picking, you have to have a reservation!  Make sure you do this ahead of time...they sell out quickly!  Cost is $5.  

Very COVID friendly...all staff and patrons required to wear a mask even when in the fields picking!

Make sure you stop by the store and grab a 6 pack of apple cider donuts :) !"
4,Great coffee with unique flavors and clever names. Brandi and Kevin were so friendly and helpful!
3,"Great food, great service and a family atmosphere.  Would definitely go again!"
2,"Service was good wings were good but, joe special was awful tasted and looked like it was cooked yesterday"
0,"This is the worst restaurant i ever had. We went there last year with a group of 12 and they charged me double price.  The son of the owner  is a cashier who is SO RUDE!!!!! Always double check the receipt make sure they don't charge you double. It happened to me. I had to tell him to go over  couple times. Foods were so bad, taste less. Do not come to this restaurant, find somewhere else. Bad food, bad service, Rude and Rude!! Do not go there."
0,The movers bashed in the top of our $1200 new dishwasher and refused to attempt repair or replacement cost.   But they did offer travel fuel reimbursement!!  DO NOT USE TWO MEN EVER!!  PARTICULARLY RENO BRANCH!!
4,"Love this place. Great food. Quick Service. Reasonable prices. Always my go-to. I do wish they accepted cards, but...Not a deal breaker."
1,"We went for breakfast several weeks in a row and ordered the exact same thing each time. My pancakes were always cold as was my hot tea, which was usually only  2/3 full. This week , my whole order was cold. When I asked for more hot water so I could have a whole cup of tea the waiter brought a whole new cup and then charged me for it! Not only was I charged for a whole second cup but I was charged 50cents more than the menu price!!! 
I definitely will not go back."
4,"Thank God they got rid of the old staff!! Amazing new staff !!! Friendly, Efficient and professional! Natalie was a great photographer and Kelly made things so quick and easy !!"
4,I needed a last minute poster for a bridal shower and when kinkos failed the job miserably walgreens got it done quick and right. The work was top notch and i was able to order it through my phone and it was done within an hour!!! The young lady at the counter even cut it to fit my frame free of charge and the total was only 17 bucks far cheaper than the 45 bucks half price sale kinkos was charging. Walgreens made my day!!!!
4,"My Nashville go-to! 
I always order the Mr. Maple. Describing it as scrumptious would be an understatement. It's a nice sized business tucked off of Woodland St. They offer free play old school games that will channel your childhood memories. The pricing is fair and the environment is very clean and welcoming. Try it out. You won't regret it."
1,Buyer beware: pick your bartenders carefully because apparently they're the ones who decide how much your drinks cost. A friend ordered a bucket of high noons for $20 then when I bought a bucket the price was suddenly $36. Guess we got the wrong bartender. Another friend ordered a bucket of 5 beers for $21 then when he went back to the bar got 6 for $17. Guess he got the right bartender the second time. Don't come here if you expect the pricing to be consistent. Asked for an itemized receipt....
2,"Look i go here a lot because it's close by my house. I'm not going to stop coming here, but damn every time i go and i mean every time the tacos are ice cold and so is the white cheese on the nachos. I just don't get it. How can this keep happening. Now i only get one or two things on the boring menu they have because at least they are hot. Need to keep your food hot for safety reasons!!"
4,Phenomenal. Praline bacon was a must order; two orders for five people. Seared scallops with lump crab were amazing. Braised cabbage had pork belly and was out of this world. Sweet potato casserole was great. Definitely a diamond in the rough. Will be back.
0,"This place needs an update...drabby carpets, broken tv remote, and a loud air conditioner (which made sleeping a challenge). Could also use some paint. Rooms are clean, though. Not worth the price."
0,"Could be one of the worst airport eateries. I know elderly that move quicker. Cold food and sat for 10 minutes to get a coffee. I don't usually complain, even signed up for yelp it was so bad. Waitress was nice but service was slow. Poorly run place."
3,"Boogaloo for dessert please! 

The bartender recommended the Bread Pudding, because ""it's the best dessert on the menu"". Can't argue with that. It was smothered in sweet bourbon sauce and fresh out of the oven hot. It was better than any bread pudding I've had in a long time, absolutely divine. Reminiscent of French toast, but 100 times better. I second that, ""it's the best dessert on the menu"".  I would have welcomed a little more of that sweet sauce for it to swim in."
4,"Great food, extremely friendly workers , very clean. been going to Paradise pizza for a long time ."
4,"If you are from Philly cross through the park and if you're from outta town...get here! The mango berry is all that. 
My girl had the lemon...Better than the flavors is the service. Siddiq has his staff trained to be welcoming and friendly offering samples with a smile. Definitely a must to come back. It's a ton of water ice spots in the city, this is the best!"
3,"I live in Voorhees NJ. I work on Broad Street in South Philadelphia near the Navy Yard. This place is out of the way, but I make the effort to stop here at least once a week. It may not be my absolute favorite, but when I am not craving a greasy bacon sandwich in the morning you can find me at Philadelphia Java Company."
0,Just stopped in to Big Joe's and sat down to eat dinner at 7:40pm on Sunday and owner comes up to us and says no more inside dining and only to go only even though they close at 10:00pm. The owners wife was the rudest person I've ever come across. I will never ever step in that place again. I hope they go out of business and lose their house!
4,"We just moved in and we love it here so much! So glad we found this place. Everyone, both staff and residents, is so friendly here and our apartment is exactly what we were hoping to find. The community is very quiet and the location isn't far from all the restaurants and stores along 4th St and downtown St. Pete. Our puppy loves how dog friendly the complex is and can't wait to go meet new friends at the onsite dog park! We are really looking forward to visiting the pool and using the fitness center. My husband and I are so happy we moved here!"
4,"Truly a time portal to another era. I only dropped in for drinks with friends, but our barman was fantastic (a handlebar mustache will do that), the beer list was phenomenal, and the punch out of this world. 

Can I just move in and live here?"
4,"Easy to get to location fron the airport. Also this beach is dog on leash friendly which is nice.  Picnic tables that overlook the Pacific, you can't beat that. Check out the beachside restaurant if you have a chance."
0,"Raw chicken.  Twice.  The owner was standing five feet away as I told my waiter, and still NO compensation was offered.  How do places like this stay open?!?"
3,Had not been in this place in over 10 years.  I was a regular during my college years  Thank God it hasn't changed!  Took the kids in for a Bob burger and it did not disappoint.  Good food and cold beers.  Bring your own Sharpie!!
0,Horrible service. Food is same as others but waiting 20-30 mins for a sub is not worth it. The Great at greeting  you but they're not great apologizing when they do something wrong. Come here off only other was no preparation for preorders by groups so you get wait for the 20 sub order the precedes you.
4,Holy Guacamole! Wow! This one of the Best Sandwiches I ever had! It was exploding with flavor. I had the Italian Sandwich and everything tasted so fresh and delicious and juicy.  Great customer service and plenty of parking. I would definitely come back.
3,Came on my first night of my Nashville vacation. Always has been a favorite Nashville sushi restaurant of mine. Always go when i get into town!
4,"Long story short:  It was West Philly Comics 3 weeks ago and I was sorry to see the shop move...it was conveniently located by my house around UPenn;  however, I followed them because the owner impressed me with his customer service.  

He calls to check in with me about picking up my books, the service is great, the staff respectfully provides opinions on other graphic novels I might like.  Check them out.  The shop is smaller but the area has some good restaurants to chill or geek-out with friends or just read some killer graphic novel you bought.

Drake"
4,"This is my favorite Mediterranean restaurant in Tucson! I am so glad my Egyptian friend recommend it to me. They have the best Gyro! And pricing is decent. Now they moved to a newer location, the place is pretty cozy. Service is ok but the food is just perfect!"
4,Very good Colombian Peruvian restaurant . Food is very tasty service is also good . Restaurant looks very clean I like the open kitchen and the ambience
0,"Absolutely disgusting. I didn't even want to finish the cheesesteak.

'wit cheese' is all you need to say. wit = with onions, cheese = slices of cheese.

1. It smelled like pee somehow
2. It was bland.
3. Not much meat.

It was just plain bad!"
4,"Best cheesesteak in philly. Have had most other places, nobody matches the service or the bread of this place. Nice people and always popping on eagles Sunday. Good cheese fries too but nothing out of the ordinary. Cool little open setup. 

Tip: have your order ready before you get up there, can get a little chippy if you don't."
0,"nachos: 30 cents of chips, 2 tablespoons of avocado guacamole, an eighth of a cup of salsa, 1 ounce of cheese and one jalapeño equals $13 of nachos. Rip Off.  Never again and they wonder why they'll go out of business. Blame it on COVID."
3,Pizza and meatballs are delicious. Vegetable sandwich was amazing. Nothing like NY pizza.
4,Delicious Mediterranean food.  Share the sampler plate with 2-4 people. Four tasty dips-spreads and warm bread. The kabob plate was plenty for two too share. Lily took great care of us and the Chef stopped by to see if we were happy. Hidden gem worth finding.
4,"Nice little coffee shop in the neighborhood. Friendly staff, tasty cold brew and assorted pastries on display. Opted for a cold brew with lavender- very refreshing and nice flavor. Spacious area conducive to work, AC on full blast for these steamy summers, clean bathroom. Would definitely return for more beverages or to try a snack."
4,"Just finished eating my way through Nashville and this place was definitely a highlight. Some of the best Mac n cheese I've ever had and topped with the hot chicken wooooo...my mouth waters just thinking about it. The combo of the two is outstanding. The burger was incredibly juicy and fresh. And the Brussels were a great way to add a little green to the meal. Place is located in the heart of downtown. We went on the earlier side of Saturday night and didn't have to wait too long for a table, but opted to sit at the bar. Very friendly service."
2,"The wait here can get long but the steaks are very good.  The meat is of the chopped up variety and not sliced but it is flavorful and the portions are good.  Their hoagies are also great,with plenty of quality meat and cheese (I like the classic Italian).  Stop by to grab a sandwich for lunch if you have the time."
4,"Food is excellent and atmosphere is excellent. 
If you want a great waitress, ask for Amanda, although I am sure the rest of the staff are great too. 
This is a very fun but still respectable atmosphere. The bar is separate from the dining area which is a brilliant idea. There is often live music on the barside. You can either have a casual, enjoyable bar night or have a romantic dinner date depending on which side you choose. Also kid friendly. Pretty ideal place. We are regulars here."
3,My husband had the Stromboli which was delicious and I had the works pizza. The personal size was plenty for two people and was amazing! They were so kind to my toddler too. Great place!
4,"This is by far the best pizza I have ever had.  The salads are delicious too.  I just wish it wasn't always so crowded or they would take reservations.  Their crust and sauce is spot on.  I think the sausage is also homemade, but it the best I have ever tried.  Let's face it, Martha Hoover is the best thing to happen to the Indianapolis restaurant scene (from way back in the day of the first Patachou).  She knows how to cook and to run great restaurants.  I love them all and they are my favorites in Indy."
0,I arrived 35 minutes before closing and was sitting in the drive through window making eye contact with the employee but she left and hit in the back without even speaking to me. I waited for about 15 minutes to be helped and In that time she would peek to see if I was still there. She was waiting until closing so she didn't have to do any more work by helping a paying customer. Worst fast food experience ever
4,"Delightful zoo-- one of the best in the country right in the midst of Audubon Park.  The animals' surroundings mimic their natural habitats. The employees and volunteers are friendly and knowledgeable. The gift shop is loaded with fun. 
Audubon Zoo is a must for visitors and locals alike"
3,"We stay at the Hampton Inn next door when we are travelling,  and we kept meaning to try this place out. Tonight (01/07/2016) we finally did. We were the only customers seated, but there was a steady stream of carryout orders. Everything was fresh, and well spiced. We are glad we finally ate here, and will again next time we pass through.

Make sure you do a Yelp checkin to get a free order of egg rolls or spring rolls!"
1,"I'm so annoyed I ordered chicken e
Wings with fried rice and they have me 3 instead of 4 . And they claim the wings are bigger that's why gave me 3 that's BS cause I order this alot sane size and the wonton soup had no crispy noodles I'm done with this place"
1,"(I was gonna go for three, but ""meh, I've experienced better"" is exactly what I thought). The day I went in I didn't find anything wrong with Stump -- it's a nice plant shop with a few cool big cacti and a pleasant selection of planters and plants -- but I don't see why anyone would go there when City Planter has everything they have and much more, is two blocks away, and has been there for ten years. I'm hoping Stump will make a place for itself with something unique."
1,Just really high prices for unoriginal flavors. C&C gives you twice the ice cream for half the price.
1,"If you're on a budget and just order a Caesar salad and the waiter offers to add a few slices of steak, say NO! They will add $42 to the bill, on top of the salad."
4,"Omg I love the wings-made my eyes water and my tongue burn and those are just the mediums!!
Then there's the rojos which totally take me to my youth. The rojos are round shaped potatoe discs coated with something divine and fried. Then we had the pesto pizza tasty!!"
4,"Their food is awesome. 
With their efficient and friendly staff, food are served fast. A long line was not an issue.

 I would so proud to introduce this place to my friends!

I love their HAPPY HOUR!"
4,"This was one of the best spa and massage experiences I've had. 
Maggie was fantastic and the massage was AMAZING (and I've had a lot of massages).
The atmosphere is very welcoming and relaxing - a cup of tea and biscotti was waiting when I was finished - such a nice and thoughtful touch. The massage and experience was just what I needed. Will absolutely be back!"
2,"Have heard that this is the best sandwich place around so tried it out.  The Italian beef was good, but can't speak for the other sandwiches yet.  There's a veggie, an Italian,  a Italian beef, and other deli sandwiches.  The restaurant is clean and simple, but not a place you would want to sit and eat.  Will probably go there again to try something else from their menu."
3,"Tatayana was awesome. Online check in is the easiest and fastest way to not wait in line. Similar to fast pass at Disney. They might want to put on some background music, but she did a great job for $14 and gave me a coupon for a $9.99 haircut o my next trip."
0,Very upsetting. Will never return. Way too overpriced and the service was so rude ever since we arrived. The miso soup was also cold. I will never return to this place. Should have went to Kobe's like my girlfriend suggested...I hate it when she's right
4,There food was amazing and the service by Destiny was amazing. Great bartender and service and a fun environment! Had a blast and love to see her back here again!
4,"Super service, super food. The hamburgers were mind, mouth, and eye blowing!! You get to choose the meat, bun, and fixings so truly have it your way. The burgers are huge and come with a side. The fries were excellent, with skins on, and definitely added to the meal. This is a great pub with atmosphere and food.  What more could you want? Definitely check it out."
2,"Ok, have gone back 3 more times since my bad experience and have enjoyed it every single time. Guess they have worked out the kinks since opening!"
3,"7 of us came here and we were on a mission to have Clam Chowder soup before we left Santa Barbara. Well mission accomplished! Clam Chowder was excellent! Everything was perfectly chopped, potatoes and celery and the clams were the perfect size. Absolutely delicious."
4,"Plentiful delicious mussels, fresh lobster salad with red onions and olives!  Mushroom Tortellini!  And BYOB!  Excellent service!"
3,"Their sandwiches are absolutely delicious! So far I've tried the Paesano and the Zawzeech, both were very tasty. The employees that work there have quite a lot of character as well and I have yet to have a boring experience while waiting for my food. My only dislikes are that it's cash only and seating is incredibly limited."
1,Lots of clothes. Not a lot of good clothes. Tends to have a lot of worn out looking clothes or things with stains. Very disappointed in selection of newly used things.
3,"The Rybread menu + beer = Rybrew. 

I'm a huge fan of Rybread's sandwiches so adding beer to the mix made it even better. I've tried a few of their sandwiches, but my favorite lately has been the San Diego panini. It's filling and I love the combo of chicken, pesto, provolone, and red pepper."
4,"This place never gets old. The hours are a pain and obnoxious to get use to. But the dishes made up for it. My usual is the spaghettini with swordfish. Upper delicious:) 

We usually sit outside and enjoy the downtown Tucson area."
4,"Really like this place. Good service, relaxed atmosphere and excellent beer selection. And if beer isn't your thing, they also have wine. 

Will definitely be back."
4,"A special little spot the whole family loves! Everything is good, the fried flauta-like California rolled tacos are currently my favorite thing. The agua frescas are worth every penny, order the cucumber lime fresca when they have it."
2,"I have been dining at this location for about 6 years...very good food, great prices.  The staff seem disconnected with consistent service.. last two visits required getting upto go get silverware and napkins...although the dim sum was delivered...  seems to be lack of consistent training,  table prep or management understanding....  next time...I will bring my fork, napkins and Yeti cup of water....otherwise great quality food...."
4,"Glad we checked out this new spot while visiting. Food was delicious (especially the pizza, Brussels sprouts, and short rib). Great ambiance! Friendly servers. They are definitely still figuring out their operations, since they are new, but this spot is worth being patient for."
2,"All of the workers were so incredibly nice, sweet and helpful. Unfortunately, they don't dust the shelves. I was looking through some tops on a rack and my mouth happened to be open.... dust bunnies got into my mouth. It was a very disgusting experience. I looked up and saw rows upon rows of dust bunnies. Gross! Will I return to this location? Not sure.."
4,"Just took my two grandsons to Cheese Dawgs for lunch.  What kid doesn't like grilled cheese and hot dogs?  I really enjoyed the sharp provolone, tomato & cilantro grilled cheese.  The kids got plain grilled cheese & hot dogs.  Perfect.  But, the real winner was a hot dog with cheese wrapped in pork roll.  Pig heaven!  This restaurant is clean, kid-friendly, and the service was great.  We will definitely be going back to Cheese Dawgs."
4,We popped in for lunch while doing some shopping nearby. So glad we did. Amazing lunch and the best chicken and brie sandwich I've ever had.
3,"Located a little off the beaten path.  A cool, fun place to pop in and browse.  Did appreciate how items were explained to those of us not familiar with voodoo.  Not the shop I was looking for but fun nonetheless, had what I was looking for."
3,"Excellent pizza, hoagies, grinders, and cheesesteaks (5 stars for their Buffalo Chicken Cheesesteak).  Eat in, take out or delivery - it's all good!"
4,"Interesting convenience store in South Reno that is a one stop shop for food, drink, smokes, and a little gambling all  rolled in one place!

Conveniently located off of South Virginia, easy in and out parking.  Great service.

Going to try their pizza.  What's not to like about gourmet pizza?"
0,"They deserve zero stars for service from our family. For the second time this year, we have tried to have 2 different Cartier watches serviced here (1 for sizing and 1 for servicing). The same woman (brown, curly hair at the Montecito location) has been rude to both of my grown daughters. On both visits. Today took the cake. After requesting links to be taken out of the watch, her response was ""my hands aren't working today"" - word for word. They have lost our business for good."
0,"We decided to grab some food here before a movie, and it was terrible. Everyone there seemed really nice, it seems clean, they have a great location, but they have to do something about the food. It's just horrible.

Now, even if it is right beside the movie theater, I'd rather search endlessly for parking in Manayunk and at least get a decent meal, then use the free parking and have to eat here. It was that bad."
3,It's a small nice place where you and your friends can come in and enjoy great food and good company .. You can enjoy your meal there or just take out! It's clean and the service is great !
0,"I had the classic ceviche/whole chicken/ red snapper. The ceviche was ok but the chicken and red snapper were not. The chicken was dry,dry,dry. The whole red snapper was not fresh and it was overcooked. Our server was very nice but she seemed very new to the job."
0,The Hyatt knows and places active duty militairy members in substandard and defunct conditions. Do not stay here for fear of raw sewage destroying your necessary work gear.
4,Awesome!...I made an appointment for my 2018 Z06 and everything went perfect. The tint job looks awesome. I waited for the car and as they stated I was out of there in 2 hrs. I will definitely be taking my truck back next to get the windows tinted.
4,"This is the best restaurant I've ever been to. Vegan or otherwise. 

I don't need to write anymore words than this. You must go."
0,Absolutely awful service. I wouldn't be shocked if the manager was fired for the people he hired to work here . I am tiktok famous and you are lucky I don't post it on my global platform to get the health department to shut it down. I would keep driving pass this place . Do not spend your money here .
0,"The food here was overpriced, quality was cheap
The grouper bites were watered down inside the breading, mushy. I had flounder with stuffed crab. It was crab stuffing, with a few pieces of flounder drowned in butter, not lobster sauce. The best thing I had was a baked potato, you get the drift. Go elsewhere. I saw my neighbors rib eye which was thin and half was left.  I usually don't review but this was bad."
3,"Excellent sandwiches! The meatball and the combination are incredible. Small selection of beer and wine, but we went for the food. Highly recommended."
4,"This is BY FAR the best mediterranean food in the area! The staff is always so friendly and the food is always fresh. From the outside it looks a little sus but don't judge a restaurant by its cover :) They give you so much food for an extremely fair price. And no, I didn't get paid to post this i'm just a big fan! Do yourself a favor and hop in the drive thru #supportlocalbusinesses"
3,"I feel like I am ALWAYS here, the store itself is clean, it is in a shopping center and the parking lot is always packed being it is right next to a pub upclose parking is slim pickings. The staff here is friendly but sometimes there is only one lane open with a line of people. This Rite Aid is 24 hours so that is very useful sometimes."
4,"This was fantastic, and a must do for your cheesestake meals. Go for the extra whiz on top with onions and you won't be disappointed. Price is great for the size of the hoagie you get! We split one ($9), and were totally fine to continue on our journey."
2,Cinnamon buns with cream cheese icing and the scones are delicious; pumpkin pie and dinner rolls for thanksgiving not so much.
4,"These guys are awesome! My wife and I held our Rehersal dinner there and we were extremely impressed with their excellent beer, great food, and amazing service. We received a ton of compliments from our guests and can't wait to return!"
4,Mom is my go-to place for the best quality organic food around.  Also love that I can get all of my healing herbs from moms.  Still trying to figure out what we did before Mom's and Sprouts ‍
4,"Been going to Castnet as long as I have been alive..lol Food is always good, some days can be crazy because the line is out the door and parking can be hard, but people still wait with minor complaints but they don't leave without their food...lol If you know the ""East"" then you know about Castnet"
4,"Don't let the cheap price fool you! The service is great & the place is beautiful not to mention clean! I love all the girls at Bella, they'll talk you through your wax and you'll inevitably become bffs with your esthetician"
1,"The service was good. The food was Bad. My boyfriend and I both ordered burgers to be cooked well done. My burger had hints of pink but I could eat it. My boyfriends burger was rare on the inside! 
No bueno!"
0,"The animals are neglected, and the owner is an asshole. Shop somewhere else, trust me."
0,"Place is trash. The prices are unreal for what you get. 15+$ for guacamole, and 20$ tacos. It'd be different if the food was actually good and worth the price, but nah. I can pick any local taqueria and get food for 1/5 the price that tastes better. Never going back"
4,Wonderful atmosphere on the patio! We had the cheese platter and everything was fresh and well-presented. We got there before the crowd and it was fun to sit outside in the brilliant Boise summer weather.
1,"The stromboli could had used a little more of the meatball and less of the garlic and caramelized onions. For paying $2.50 for a topping with pepperoni, I expected more than what appears to be a cheese pizza!"
3,"We were 4 for lunch on a super hot day. The wait staff was great, constantly refilling our water as we were melting in the heat.
They definitely have the whole Covid outdoor dining down with lots of room between tables, staff all wearing masks. The food was great, I had the suggested award winning burger (I forget which one it was) and it was delicious!
I will be back."
0,"impressively bad food, left me feeling embarrassed for recommending the place to my professional colleagues after seeing the recommended reviews ‍"
4,Thanks to these specialists I had 3 parathyroid adenomas removed. I had a litany of symptoms and had been told by my local physician it was all normal aging! My own research lead me to believe I had hyperparathyroidism which was difficult to diagnose in my case. After my telephone consult with Dr. Ruan I was convinced. We are blessed to have these doctors here in Florida! Thank you Tampa General Hospital!
3,"I can't really speak from the view of a passenger but the terminals are really cleaned up from the last time I was here (eight years a go). I think American acquiring Us Airways really helped the terminals improve looks and retail wise. Plenty of options for food at B term. Chick-Fila, smashburger, subway, Starbucks, Vino Volvo, sushi etc. Terminal is very clean and the announcements aren't on top of each other like EWR & LAX."
3,"I, like America, run on Dunkin.  Dunkin coffee that is.  So now that there are a few Dunkin Donuts popping up across town, I was very excited to have some of my favorite coffee in the STL.  Yeah, it's a chain, but there is nothing better than a medium regular coffee with 2  creams and 1 sugar.  It really gets my day going.  This location still seems brand new and very nice on the interior.  I love those long john's too."
4,The bourbon bananas foster is my favorite! All the foods I've tried have been really yummy. Wait staff is very friendly. Great place to go for boozy or non alcoholic ice cream/desserts!
4,"Great food at a great value, especially for catering a large group.  No better deal to be found in Upper Merion!

Love the chicken pesto pasta!!"
4,I just recently moved to Tennesse and Wild Ginger was one of the first places I visited. The food was amazing! I had the lemon grass shrimp with jasmine rice. I have been back 4 times already. They have a pretty nice happy hour and the sushi is really good.
3,"Overall had a great experience staying in this hotel.  The reviews are accurate.  The Summit rooms are spacious and clean.  Definitely avoid the concierge level upgrade.  Room size is the same as the summit rooms below. You pay an extra $20 per day but the concierge is only open from 7:00 am to 10:00 am.  You are better off going the buffet for breakfast daily.  As for bottled water and other snacks, you can go to Walmart across the property.
If you are age 55 or over you get a 20% discount at all the restaurants."
4,"Easily the best location in town. Plenty of books, clean store and helpful staff and wayfinding."
4,"Mannnnn this is truly one of the most fresh/best tasting seasoned salads I've ever had in my life and ima salad person!! The chicken was seasoned to perfection fresh off the grill and tons of it , plenty of fresh crunchy veggies, they provided enough dressing like most places WONT! Anddd not to mention it was 1:30 am and they got my order here expeditiously! More than Decently priced and the service was spectacular! I'm impressed and pleased.. which is very hard to do dealing with me lol"
0,"Was out celebrating my wife's graduation. Asked if I could use my own bottle opener so I wouldn't have an allergic reaction in case beer was spilled on the one they use. Was told ""You have the wrong bar buddy I can't serve you"". Don't know how she became a waitress if she can't follow one simple request"
2,"It feels like a cross between Pier One and an international convenience store.

On one hand, they've got a wide selection of furniture, linens, and accessories.  It all looks to be good quality, and would look in people's houses.  On the other hand, they have an impressive selection of international snacks and drinks.

It's all pretty expensive, though, so I don't go there much, but when I do get something, I know it's going to be high quality.`"
1,"Buffalo chicken cheese steak is pretty good.  Service is meh at best.  Looking at some of the other reviews, I'm not alone in this opinion.  Not uncommon to be ignored when waiting to place my order.  There have been a couple times where finding a clean table was a challenge.  

Funny- my sammich just arrived, and about half of the ingredients were not in the bread.  Some assembly required."
2,"Dr. J at A+ is awesome!  He has been great to me and my many dental issues.  He is patient and explains what is going on.  I plan to continue to go to this practice just to remain a patient of Dr J's, however, the administrative staff and and how they handle things, I don't care for AT ALL.  Hopefully it gets turned around, but it's been this way for a while."
4,"First time visiting Tucson and noticed this place off the road, quickly turned around to try it! Figured it was more of a Panera type restaurant but they serve breakfast and brunch foods. The Steak and Egg croissant is a must try! Very delicious and worth the money spent."
4,Really liked it and will now be making this our go to sushi place. Sometimes the service is abysmally slow but if you never go if you're in a hurry then all is well.
0,HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE !!! Never again will I go there to eat ! Paid 12 dollars for 2steak tacos !! Ridiculous!! And not nearly enough food ! Not authentic Mexican cuisine !!
4,We spent two years and had some bad advice and finally found Nancy. After two weeks and her assessments of our needs and what was available we found exactly what we were looking for -- she knows what it takes to make the sale and with no fussing and getting right to it all was ours!  Her confidence and finesse was a breath of fresh  air and I send my family and friends alike to her.  Expect nothing but the best. Do not hesitate and miss out on what could be yours! 5 plus stars all around! Thanks Nancy!!!!
0,"I had an appointment to consign a few clothes & the employee accepted all but a few & I signed a contract.  Then one of the owners came over & gave me back all the clothes because they were ""dated"" & she didn't want them.  It made me feel very embarrassed.  I've shopped there many times, but this was the first time I've ever tried to consign anything.  I will NEVER go there again."
3,"Great value and satisfying steak. For $30 including tax and tip, I got a full, saucy 16oz bone-in ribeye and a massive baked potato loaded with cheese and bacon (extra charge, though). The steak was cooked exactly as requested, delightfully deep red inside, though not as tender as I would have wanted. It's what you pay for. 

Trade off for value is the dismal quality of service. Our server didnt return to take our orders for at least 10-15 minutes. We were also never given the complementary dinner rolls..."
4,"What a beautiful park.  Thank you Yelp for leading me there!  Had a lovely afternoon with my dog walking around the preserve and walking down to the dog beach below, which was hands down the nicest dog beach we've been to.  A must visit if you've got a dog or just love dogs."
3,Great place to grab a quick Mexican bite to eat! The food came out very fast and was delicious! The wet burrito was very filling and tasty. Their ingredients are definitely fresh. I'll be back!
3,"Tried it, liked it.  Most men's haircuts aren't that complicated, so they should only cost barbershop prices.  $23+tip is reasonable.  Had Erin, was fun to talk to.  Will be back."
2,"Their competing with all the 20 million mexican food trucks and stands here in town, and it does get a little confusing sometimes.  I had ordered a beans rice and cheese with shredded beef burro.  I would have like more beans and rice and cheese with my HUGE portion of shredded beef.  The beef was over powering the entire burro.  Next time  will order it without meat.

The staff is very friendly, the Drive thru attendant talk with me about how my days was going and we still talked for a few minutes after I got my order.  =)"
2,Update on all of my reviews.  Mor Furniture did make everything right.  Dan stepped in when Derek was on vacation and Dan is definitely the one to see when you go in.  You will get a straight answer from him.  The delivery was great also.
4,I was very happy with my whole experience at Greek City Cafe.  The food is very authentic and fresh and the staff was helpful and fun.  I plan to go back a few times a month!
2,"Good food! But when they run out of steak, they cut it up for you and serve half your steak to someone else. smh. Look for yourself in the photos, some steak served whole and some steak cut up. 

never had my steak come cut up anywhere else but here."
2,I have been to this location a few times and it has fantastic products however when I was with a friend I followed the yelp directions and it took me to a residential home. Not okay.
4,After partying to the fullest this past new year I had to top it with a delicious seafood paella. $36.00 gets you a delicious blend of seafood.  I yet to put a dent on this plate.
0,"I was there today around 11 o'clock nobody in the place when I walked in the lady at the counter was on the phone. I got a menu and gradually walk towards the front so that I can place my order. Well what she did was walk away still talking on the phone so I waited at the counter for a few minutes still Greeting, I was more or less just in her way and she did not care that I was there. I promptly walked out and will not return.  I get this place 10 times down!!"
0,Waited in line for over 20 mins in drive thru for a happy meal. Workers here couldn't care less. The one worker walked a meal out to someone's car and a turtle literally passed him and there's a line of cars 10 deep. Will never use this location again
3,"We love the frozen yogurt shop with the funny name!
Best thing, it's  open 'til 10pm on weekdays and 11pm on Fri/Sat - for those of us who crave ice-cream alternatives late in the evening (and after Foster Freeze closes) it hits the spot. 
Flavors are tasty toppings are fresh - and the staff is super sweet. :-)"
4,I love this place. Great food and atmosphere.  It's good comfort food.  I would definitely come back to eat. It's also inexpensive to go there to eat.
4,Food is delicious and authentic. Price is excellent. Big portion. Place is clean. Highly recommended.
4,"I was seen within a few minutes and the doctors treated my urgent condition quickly and were very knowledgable. 

I was also able to get my flu shot quickly. This place is great for kids and adults. Very friendly staff and clean environment."
0,Absolutely horrible!!! I took my daughter and her friend in to get nails done... I also got my nails done and it was such a poor job! Not only that but they got us in and then only took 1 hour in total for 1set of nails and two manicures! Absolutely horrendous job! They are not friendly and they try to upcharge anyone who walks in that door!
4,"One of the best dining experiences. From attentive service to spectacular food this place has it all. The minute you walk in you feel as if your dining is valued. The chef, servers, and all staff go above and beyond to help you with feel comfortable giving you insight to find the food most paired to your taste. The list of daily specials are amazing. Seriously make a reservation you won't be disappointed."
3,"Great food, great atmosphere and crazy good food.  The french toast is just amazing.  If you're coming for brunch, I highly suggest you try the french toast.  If you happen to come by later in the day, check out the uber-cool bar area that's hidden behind some chain curtains."
4,"We catered our NYE party with gyros and greek salad!  Everyone raved.  However, unless you want to pass out leftovers to your exiting guests, cut your order down by at least 2 servings.  We had enough meat for double our guests -- same for salad and tzaziki sauce.  The shorter part of the order which really met our needs, even with leftover packaging, was the pitas.  We'd do it again in a heartbeat.  Thank you to Pappoule's!"
3,"I wish I could get out to City Park more often.  I hear people my age complain about how there aren't any great parks or good places for active people in New Orleans.  Ummmmm.....what!?  City Park is hugeeeee and has so much to do.  Storyville, Golf course, multiple huge kids areas, paddle boats, kayaking, LONG trails.  Love love love City Park.  It's also a wonderful place for photography.  Lots of little hidden areas that you won't see unless you go exploring!"
3,"Visiting Nashville for a concert and tried this biscuit love brunch!  Restaurant looks really new, food was very good. They have a simple menu which states they are using locally grown items. Yay!  We would go back for sure!  Found parking across the street."
4,"Best kielbasa in the city! Super authentic. I mean, they have a pic of Pope John Paul II on the wall for God's sake! Service is always quick & super friendly. Great flavors & selection. And the free samples are a sweet bonus. Have been coming here for years & will continue doing so."
4,"We recently ate at Arizona Pizza Company, and the pizza is delicious!  The staff was friendly!  We were greeted right away and the pizza portions were huge. Great prices, many menu options, friendly staff, and a clean restaurant!  We will definitely be back soon."
0,"the 'head' manager made up some fictious rule that to return a broken TV you have to get a repair statement from a TV Repair place. WTF is that? Magical rules made on the spot.
The store is nice, but bad management doesn't help. If you're returning anything, take it to the Reno store, at least they take care of you and don't give you a hassle."
3,Ordered the giganto pizza with pepperoni and fresh garlic. Being from the northeast it's difficult to find good pizza in Florida. But this place is definitely one of the better pizza joints I've been to in Tampa Bay. It's a little out of the way for me to frequent here but definitely recommend it to those who are visiting the downtown Tampa area. The dough is great and the ingredients were fresh and tasty. Be prepared for a long line though as this place appears to be busy all the time.
4,"Nothing on earth could be better than going to Wawa.
I can't find the location on route 130 to review, so I'll review this one. 

ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmm so using a computer to order a sandwich with horseradish, two kinds of peppers and spicy mustard...is like something out of a dream.

that sandwich + a monster energy drink + two cigarettes = what i have been eating for dinner on my commute back to bucks county this month.

so i guess, for my health, i am glad i moved back into the city this week."
4,"This is my favorite ""local vape shop ""  even though I live on the east coast . First the shop will literally ship as fast as Amazon.  The people who work there are pleasant people. I have placed 3 orders now and will return.  If you want an exclusive item that other shops won't have and item is normal priced this is the spot ."
4,"Fabulous rehearsal dinner upstairs last night.  It was the perfect setting.  Guests enjoyed the balcony experience.  The food was wonderful, especially the shrimp and grits!  Garage parking right across the street made for very easy access.  The bar tenders and staff were the best!  
A great place!"
4,"I love this place. Haven't had a bad experience ever. Sam was awesome so was Andre. The meals have been yumm. We have had the black mussels, lobster, crab, shrimp, cole slaw, kids chicken baskets, kids fish and chips. The only thing we will probably not order again was the fried calamari but everything else won't disappoint."
3,"A great hotdog place to grab a bite.  All the dogs we tried were delicious.  The Saint was my favorite. It has a nice heat and aftertaste.  I can't wait to come back here again.  My only complaint is that they were out of all the ice cream flavors so no shakes, or root beer floats.   They were also out of the ginger soda.  I'd definitely come here again and if you are looking for a satisfying, quick bite you should too."
2,"This is a new place we wanted to try because we like Rolf and daughter. Parking was a major problem and we parked two blocks away and walked through some shady streets. 
The restaurant is well decorated and has a great vibe. We just didn't love the food that much. The cocktails we ordered were lacking flavor and alcohol. Disappointing"
4,"Wow!  I happened in here while my dad was across the street at the hospital.  Completely unassuming, and really down to business...  it's a sandwich-lover's sandwich shop!  Really huge sandwich, piled high with meat, and served with a pickle.  Only word for it is ""delicious""!  Friendly counter service, and generally quick food prep.  Small-ish inside, but it was lunchtime, and I had a spot to sit!
Reasonably priced, especially considering the portion sizes!
Would go again!"
0,"I really want to like this place and support it, but they repeatedly DO NOT disclose when they're missing ingredients on the farm to bagel. 

You need to tell people that they're only getting half the ingredients when you run out! 

I would just order something else instead of accidentally leaving with something I didn't want. 

It's extremely frustrating to get back to work and have the best parts of the bagel missing. No sprouts, no onion - no warning."
3,"I went in here one day to pick up a race packet and ended up buying a few other goodies. 

They have a good selection of clothing and the prices are very reasonable. The employees were helpful, especially considering the place was packed with people picking up their packets. In addition they carry a lot of the other running accessories you cannot find at large sporting good stores. 

I have not gone in for shoes, and will possibly try that out another time."
3,"The tacos I had today ($10 for 3) were very good. Traditional corn tortillas with slightly pickled red onions, jalapeños, carrots, pork or chicken, and other tasty flavors. I think these ""gourmet"" food trucks charge too much, but the food was satisfying and fresh."
2,"Really really liked this place! Very packed before a Pacers Game. But we arrived 30 minutes before tip off and were able to get in and out without a problem. My food was piping hot! I had a philly cheese steak wrap and needed time for it to cool. But, the beer special made up for the inconvenience: $5 for a 24 oz yuengling. Definitely a quick and cheap option before attending a game and spending money on stadium food!"
3,"Great burger and tremendous fries! Word to the wise - don't try eating this is your car. It's a big, sloppy mess, but worth it!"
4,"Awesome tacos. AMAZING peanut salsa!! Extremely accommodating. We love the Haley St breakfast burrito. And they're typically on the Axxess card. 

My husband surprised me with a taco party for Valentine's Day at my office. Colmena really came through for him!!"
0,Was here on a business trip and the staff was really rude. They closed the dining room which was fine but then she was very rude when I asked if we could go through the drive through. We just went back to the hotel instead.
4,The huntsman burger and the Mac and cheese were total winners!  And the coffee/oatmeal/vanilla stout on nitro was amazing!
3,"We have been getting takeout from BaDar about once a week for a while now. I don't think it's the best I have ever had, but it is good and the portions are very generous. I can recommend it."
0,"This wawa is always unkept. I've been here multiple times and it is usually messy. Went to the milkshake machine and an employee had left cleaning wipes on the counter next to where you should be able to set up your food. Then at the register, there was unwrapped lollipops inside the candy container with unsold candies. Definitely not organized or kept clean. A manager should definitely be keeping up with this store and making sure it is organized and cleanly!"
2,"Everyone liked the pizza, and I LOVED the kale salad. The service, though, is laughably bad."
4,"Just finished my car's inspection and an oil change here.  My car was promptly done and well taken care of.  I'm very satisfied with the service they have provided and I'll be coming back.  The receptionist lady is very friendly and nice, instantly felt like a shop I've known for a long time the moment I called.  Thank you for the great service. !"
2,It was a rather bland atmosphere. The drinks were good and it has ample menu options. Two of the four meals we ordered were very good. But my son and I had the grilled shrimp that came out cold.
0,"I had the most uncomfortable retail experience at this Auto Zone location. While searching for car paint in one of the aisles, I noticed that I was the only customer in the store. While doing my shopping, I overheard an employee telling an extremely vulgar and sexual story to his fellow coworker. The details were so foul that I left the store in a hurry. It seemed that the employee working noticed me in the store and purposely told the story loud enough for me to hear. This has never happened to me in a work establishment before and I will no longer be supporting any Auto Zones due to this inappropriate and uncomfortable experience."
3,This is our second time eating at Irma jeans. The wait staff is very friendly. The food came out very quick. I couldn't believe how quick it came out. My food is quite delicious. I got Ryan's pork tacos. They are quite tasty. My dinner companion got the brisket cheese sandwich. And she thinks it is very good. A little too much bread. But very good.
4,"Really great repair guy, John I believe his name was, very knowledgeable, personable and professional. Would reccomend this company to family and friends."
2,Food is always good when I get it but my call never goes through on Togo orders for months now so only 3 stars because of the inconvenience of having to come in and wait a long time for my order to actually be done.
3,After about 3 visits to TJ's I'm a fan! Service was excellent every time and food was very good. Only suggestion would be to add a few more selections. Bavarian pretzel with cheese dip is a great starter - just the right amount so that it's not too filling. Hangover Burger was great!
4,This place hits the spot every time! Bomb service and great food. Their cold brew is so good. And they have a Vegan menu also which was a huge plus!
4,Holy smoke.  To call this place a dive is like calling the grand canyon a hole in the dirt.  You never know what you will see.  The people are friendly and it is just a good place to cut loose.
4,The best around. Great selections.  Quality meats. Great diner outlet. Awesome Amish furniture outlet. Emma Jeans is awesome!  Great quality. A company you can trust.
3,"This one is much cleaner than some of the others. Good is delicious and cooked fresh. So yes, the drive through takes a while but it's so worth it!"
4,"Who else is quarantined with kiddos and looking for things to keep them occupied? I learned this local bakery was doing DIY kits and it was a hit. I can't have gluten, but rumor is they are quite tasty. They offer selections for boys and girls with 6 cookies, icing and sprinkles.  We managed to score some teacger and healthcare appreciation treats while we were at it. We will definitely consider this bakery for any upcoming needs."
0,Use to love this place until I spent $13 for $6 worth of food girl must have been new but I will never go if she's working again. Actually got 1/2 a bowl of food I didn't know she paid for the raw ingredients. If a girl with a black afro is working just walk away before you disappointed.
4,"Been here about four times so far, for family birthdays. Each and every single time we've come, we have been blown away at how extremely entertaining and unbelievably friendly our servers/cooks-chefs have been. Would recommend to any and all wanting some pretty amazing entertainment and delicious food!"
0,"All smoke and mirrors here

Do not believe anyone about how great their advantage program is and how much they value customer service.  Not true here.  The service area is pristine but customer service stinks."
4,"The service was wonderful and attentive.
The food was really great.  Fresh bread and oil to start. And I had Shrimp scampi while my friend had a salad with a perfectly cooked salmon.  
The ambiance is nice as well.  Nice music, not too loud. You can have a conversation without having to yell.  
Also,  no long wait on a Sunday evening."
4,This is a great place to come out and enjoy the day with the family.  We always come out on opening day as a family tradition.  Every year they offer something new for the kids.  They have an amazing petting zoo and horse and pony rides.  Tractor and train rides and pumpkin patches.  Sling shots and corn mazes.  Oh and pizza! Come out and check it.
0,"Terrible Customer service! I lost my glasses and called them with the driver id and taxi number. They hung up on me every time
I called them! Stay away from this ahady rude company"
2,"I prefer Zallie's shoprite to the Brown's by me in Bellmawr.  Zallie's makes better coleslaw and potato salad.  Other than that, they are all pretty much the same."
4,"Best wings, great service, wonderful crowd. My favorite bar. Would suggest this place to all locals and newcomers alike. The menu is great and the staff is even better. I love this place."
2,"Friendly staff, close to hotel, beer was good but food was just ok. Had pizza and wings. Cute place but won't go back even though so close and convenient to hotel"
3,"Naf, Naf is Mediterranean food served in a Chipotle style atmosphere.  The chicken shawarma is so good!  Love their fresh pita bread and hummus bowl. It's a little pricey for what you get, but the food is so good."
1,"I rarely have fun when I'm here. I gave it a chance for a few weeks, then refused to be dragged over. Rather boring music honestly. The most annoying mix of people, and a lot of sleazy men! So gross! I've run into a few interesting people on the 3rd floor (where the billiards are) by accident."
4,I've been there several times and every time the entrees get better which is great since the boucherie is out of this world.  All that and Johnnie Walker blue at the bar.  Killer.  Always.
1,"Honestly, other than the ""aesthetic"" it is not worth your money.  The staff was a mess and the food was mediocre."
3,"Great takeout for a reasonable price. Mexican Salad was tasty and cheap as we're the enchaladas. Not greasy, and generous servings."
4,Great place! Makes you feel like you are next to the beach. Went of a Thursday night with a date and had a good time. Live band and cool relaxed atmosphere :)
4,"A little pricey but you get what you pay for.

Good Food. Good Menu.  Good Service.  What more do you want?"
4,"I have reviewed this company several times in the past, and here again find myself acknowledging their great service and quality. Mike was at my home recently for a spring ac tuneup, and to fix a minor leak to an exhaust pipe that vents the furnace. Both jobs were completed quickly, and with superior results. Mike is very friendly (my dog Bailey seemed to agree), and is obviously skillful at his craft. I always feel confident that i'm getting the best whenever they walk through the door. This is a great company to hire for all your hvac needs."
0,"They have great French Fries and Cheese Fries, but that's it. They make their cheesesteaks like minute steaks. It's tough to chew like leather."
0,Worst car wash ever they don't specify that rubber mats don't get rinsed or washed without an additional cost where cleaning mats should be part of their wash for any car cleaning
1,"Just ok...maybe it's just older...but if feels really dingy. Hotel staff was nice, kids enjoyed the pool. Would not come back."
4,"This is a cute modern spot that everyone will enjoy.
They have so many different favors to choose from  as well as vegan flavors,which I'm happy about.They have a variation of toppings such as sweet,salty and sour and everything else you can think of.This is the perfect 
Date spot or family nite out or just a sweet treat for 
Yourself. won't be disappointed !"
4,"The food is great and the service is awesome. My girlfriend had never been so I took her for the first time and the waitress went over the entire menu and drink menu with us. The banana foster is the best, in pancakes and French toast. The shrimp and girts and amazing, spicy but I love it; it comes with 2 pieces of pita bread and omg they are so good. I could eat those with the sauce alone."
4,Excellent food and atmosphere. Cheddars provides huge portions and wonderful service everytime I have gone.
0,I went in for protein nails almost two weeks ago. After less than a week they started to crack and they look horrible. I'm very disappointed because I've been there for manicures and pedicures and they were great. Will not be getting protein nails done here again.
4,"To be completely honest, I have been to multiple Mexican restaurants around Reno and Sparks and you can't get anymore authentic than Los Campesinos. The food has the taste as if you were to be in Mexico. I am pretty picky with my food and this place just hit the spot not once not twice but over 20+ times I've been here to eat. It's a family and locally owned restaurant, I'm always up to supporting our locally owned restaurant here in our little big city. Customer service here is always 100%"
4,Amazing brunch and service is fantastic! Avocado toast and chia coconut pudding is a must. Chef Nina Compton was a favorite of mine on Top Chef and we were able to see her cooking on the line on our way out. We will definitely be back whenever we visit NOLA.
4,I had never been here before and decided to try it after high praise from my coworkers. I was definitely not dissatisfied I have the vegetarian turkey sandwich and it was delicious! Will definitely be ordering from them again.
4,"I have been going to Top Nails for years! Patti, Sony, Don & Cindy are all great! The prices are very reasonable, the salon is very clean. Patti is excellent with clients! I would highly recommend this salon!"
1,"The products are pricey and I don't get the feel that things move quickly here-questionable freshness.  Also clean silverware splash distance away from the dirty, that's gross. No thanks."
1,"was ok.. nothing special.. Brussel sprout were good but nothing out of the ordinary.. chicken sandwich was.. well a.. chicken sandwich.. ""slightly"" better than chick-fil-a... a bit overpriced.. maybe I would go back but not on my go to places.."
0,"brought them my vehicle under time constraints to get my a/c looked at and subsequently fixed... not only did they not even look at it, but they straight up lied to me about it.

previously, i brought them my vehicle to get the breaks fixed, and while they were able to identify the problem, they weren't able to get the parts.

they say an honest mechanic is hard to find... if you're in Philly, keep looking."
0,This is the worst car wash in northern Nevada.  If you go there they will steal from you.  I tried to give them Zero stars.
3,"Excellent food, wonderful ambience. My experience however was tempered by bad weather - it was 90 degrees outside & inside. Would love to come back when it's not so hot and be able to more fully enjoy the meal."
4,The food and service was great ! I had the shrimp and grits and it was phenomenal! Also the biscuit were good !
4,"Fantastic food, The breakfast menu is awesome. We get the Bloody Mary with Tequila, Wow! incredible.  The staff is very friendly and attentive.
I highly recommend Santo Mezcal.  Cheers!"
0,"Y'all suck ass. Don't be open til 2AM - and then hang up on people. Fuuuuuuuck YOU! I have been calling since 11PM! Just for a guy to answer at 1:45 and say they're closed... y'all ain't y'all close at 2AM. Not 1:30, 1:45 NONE OF THAT. Y'all take orders til 2AM. Scumbags"
2,This was a super crowded noisy place. Even though we had reservations for 7:30 they wouldn't seat us as long as our entire party of 9 wasn't there.  Two of our party came at 7:40 so we had to wait an hour for the table.  Finally at 8:30 we were seated. The food was okay. Nothing great. The salsa lady came up to our table to make fresh salsa for us. But I have definitely had better tasting salsa than that. Lots of gimmicks but average food.
4,"When you walk into Canal Bistro it feels like yo walk into a home of a friend. John took our orders and was extremely friendly and funny. We ordered the creole Benedict, bayou St. John's and the chicken waffles Benedict. My personal favorite was the chicken and waffle Benedict it was the perfect amount of sweet and savory. The Hollandaise sauce is absolutely amazing here. The creole Benedict was nice and salty and the crab cake with the St. John was cooked to perfection. Really need to check this place out."
4,"Had a great meal at Lotus Bistro  this evening. Great selection on the menu, prices are very reasonable and great quality. Staff is very courteous and inviting  and the owner Betty is wonderful. She has done a fabulous job of designing a warm and innovative restaurant. I was blown away when I walked in the door. Great addition to Harrison Avenue. The tempura was spot on as were the rolls and sushi and other items we were s happy to see a Japanese  restaurant in the area. This place is a must on your list you won't be disappointed !"
3,"I too, started out not too good but ended up ecstatic about Bill Brown!  Same drill, Deal Chicken for Miami Beach, booked it and then a few days later found out they could not do that particular time frame.  Same line about, well you can use any time with in our allotted time frame, but how often do you make the trip from Indiana to Florida?  Got a hold of MAGGIE POLLARD  and she was brilliant!  I inquired about using my voucher in Key West on my requested days and she hooked me up with a great suite at the Hilton.  We had a marvelous two days!

Thank you Bill Brown!"
1,"This restaurant came recommended by last night's bartender. Swing and a miss for us.  I guess if your idea of baked omelette is scrambled eggs with cheese melted on top then you won't be disappointed,  but I was, not what I expected at all. Also if you don't want your sodium level skyrocketed by a million milligrams I'd skip the home fries with breakfast. There was so much season salt on them I couldn't eat them. Nothing to go back for as far as we can tell from this experience."
3,Came to Root for a couple of drinks only. The drinks did not disappoint. The menu has been recently updated by the bartender and he did a great job adding some kick to the drinks.
4,"I love this hotel. It is brain, historic, well-appointed with gorgeous decor and furnishings, I even have a little balcony. They have so much available gratis in the bathroom, including a sewing kit in case you  tear your hem or lose a button. 

The bed was über comfy with the normal hotel pillows (gag) and one ultra soft and squishy pillow for people like me. 

And, to make me even happier, it's haunted! I felt someone touch my back. I saw someone in the hall. 

I truly couldn't be happier."
4,"good food! very flavorful!!! fast , fresh and affordable!! friendly staff  and big portions!!"
4,Heaven on earth  I've spent the last 30 years with my family on this ranch & it still brings tear when we arrive. It's just breathtaking
4,"New place at Fairmount ave. Delicious and good service too. They serve poke with fresh fish and great sandwich, one of the best panini that I ever had!"
4,The food is wonderful and always fresh it's a great place to have breakfast or brunch
4,"Went for happy hour stayed for donner 
Tortellini w sherry sauce was delicious 
Great service at the bar !"
3,"This place is great! The food is authentic as well as the experience since you eat without silverware (unless you prefer otherwise). I only ordered vegetarian dishes and I loved the flavors as well as the fact that it was not oily, on the contrary, very healthy"
1,"They recently lost a couple stars when they increased prices, which was to be expected, considering the previously generous portions they served. However they have started making their sandwiches on bread that's about 20-25% smaller, so this makes me feel like they don't want me around. At the very least, I'll be cutting back on my drink orders there as well as the frequency of my visits.
Bison WItches has gone from a once-a-week place to visit to a couple-times-a-month place to visit, sadly. I'll be back, just a lot less frequently."
4,"Amazing seafood. Oysters were fantastic , and hard shell crabs were addicting. Highly recommend this establishment. 

Also, very friendly staff. Seems to be a family owned restaurant. Awesome vibe"
3,"We ordered dim sum from the menu - portions are smaller than mandarin house, but tastes great nevertheless. Quick dim sum fix!"
4,"I love Pure! My favorite yoga studio I have attended so far! The instructors are awesome, and they accommodate all levels of yogis. There are lots of fun and different classes to try on any given day. They recently added showers which is very nice to have after a hot yoga class. I've enjoyed every class I've taken to date!"
3,"Fast and friendly service. Establishment was clean and conveniently located in gateway shopping center.

I ordered a little bacon cheeseburger, drink, and shared Cajun style fries. And everything was made in a timely manner.

Overall, the quality of food was made to order but I was surprised how much the prices increased."
4,Amazing food and drinks. For real y'all go check them out and thank me later. My server was the best and was extremely knowledgeable.
4,"The server..the live music and the eggs benedict  were excellent my partners eggs were cooked just as requested
They have a epic bloody Mary bar they give you a glass of vodka  and ice and tell you to add whatever you like Epic"
2,"Overall, the ambiance is good. However, the food is overrated for the prices they offer. Our server was also not attentive at all.. This individual lacked good customer service skills."
4,Give me a break. How could it not be a 5 star. Bonus exhibition -- Magritte!! I can't deduct a star for the museum but the visitors overall sure lacked a sense of humor. Pull the cork out folks--it's surrealism!
4,Robert Waterman is the man to see at Volvo. Very smart and filled witha world of information.
1,"(+) good vegetarian options, simple, fresh
(-) nothing stands out, nothing special"
0,"I am highly disappointed with not only the service, but with the quality of the food. The waitress did not even take our drink order for 10, maybe 15 minutes. She then insinuated she would take care of us and offer a break, but rather gave us a coupon for $5.00 off our next meal. Frankly, the food was mediocre and overpriced. I would have much rather received $5.00 off my bill, as I know I will never willingly eat there again."
4,"Love me some Chuys. I had the enchiladas. Came with side of rice and beans. Good, fast, easy to split bill with friends. Good atmosphere and fun crowd."
3,"Wow! First time here and love it! Clean, great service, food is really good, portions are just right, and value. I wouldn't call this place fast food. Its as close as you can get to a good sit down without hurting your wallet"
4,"Can I say after the Luke's 32 bar this week bad experience, this bar is a HELL YEAH, deserves all five stars.  Great music too"
3,"Food was DELICIOUS!  I really like the farm to table freshness & seasonal variety they offer.  The vertical garden & market is a nice touch.  

They also provide a nice family bathroom, for those of us with small children.  

Only complaint was that service was a little on the slow side. BUT our server was very knowledgeable & friendly.  

Can't wait to go back!"
4,"Excellent pizza and friendly staff! They get it right every time! Tasty sauce, no skimping on the cheese and delivery is always better than expected!"
4,"The service is great. The food is on fire. The location is ideal. I love eating here. Great prices. Lunch special 11am-3pm. Drunken noodles, ramen, and all of the soups are wonderful. I will definitely be back many more times."
1,"admittedly, i came early (about 25 minutes before my appointment), as this was my first time here. the stylist checks me in, let's me know she's running a little behind but she should be ready to see me at 4. so i wait until 4.. then 4:15... then 4:30, and finally, 4:45. i understand i'm a college student, but my time matters too. and i was planning on using my afternoon to do homework, not sit in the waiting room of a salon wasting my data."
4,The fire grilled oysters were awesome!!! had the Short ribs and the wife had the Cochon (pork) both were excellent!!! Definite Go To.
4,"Ribs were awesome. Fries were the best fries. Potatoe salad, loved it. Best BBQ I've had in these parts. Oh man."
4,"We stopped here on Labor Day for a late lunch.  The restaurant was not very crowded and we were seated immediately.  There was only one server (Richard) working, so he was rather busy despite the fact that there weren't a lot of customers in the place.  Richard was very attentive and pleasant.  We had a great dining experience and will be back the next time we are in the area."
3,"Been going to these guys for the past year, every three months for oil change. They are a bit disorganized but probably the quickest place for an oil change around here and they don't try to scam you. Costs about $45 for the basic service."
3,"This place stays busy but it doesn't usually take forever to get a seat. The restaurant is rather spacious so there is plenty of seating, indoors and out. There is plenty to choose from on the menu and you get large portions for a very reasonable price. The service is usually good and the servers are good at keeping drinks refilled. Good place to eat in large groups or eat after church on a Sunday."
3,"One of the best spots for deserts in St. Louis. Great location. Cosy ambiance. Wide varieties of interesting flavors. Friendly service. Fancy and beautiful chocolate boxes. Parking is crazy sometimes over the weekend. 

Brownies- they are ok! Honey and brownies are not my favorite combination 
Hot chocolate- is very good and creamy
Chocolatini- is SUPER delicious!!"
4,"Aaron was a life saver for us. My boyfriend and I hit a massive pothole in Tahoe and blew two tires. No one in Tahoe carried the tire size that we needed, but we found them in Reno. We couldn't extend our stay, so we needed to get the tires that day. I started calling moving companies, task rabbit, etc looking for someone who could get the tires to us ASAP. Aaron jumped on the problem immediately. He was really communicative, sent pictures of the tires to confirm, and got to us right away. We really appreciated his help."
4,"The food was amazing
Scarlett our server was exceptional 
Ambiance is unique and upbeat with Good Vibes."
1,"2.5 stars I give it First time 5 minutes ago. Service through drive is just alright. I would Recommend going inside. Didn't have the condiments that I asked for nicely and napkins. Hoping for better service next time. Willing to give this establishment another chance dinning in. My food is just okay, not crazy about the loafs of  bread hopefully they can get some bread with seasoning with garlic or other flavors."
4,"Love this place! It's a regular for me. Best taco deals on their happy hour, 10 tacos for 12$! Drinks are always good."
1,"This was my first sushi experience and was my preferred sushi restaurant for some time. However, after several sub par meals and funky mop bucket stench permeating the establishment during my last visit I haven't been back. I might risk another visit had I not found a far better sushi source over in Sparks."
4,Dr. Souyoul is the best. She's very thorough and friendly. I love coming to see her and would recommend her to anyone.
2,I have gone here a few times now. I like the servers and the atmosphere. The caprese sandwich is a disappointment though. They don't have a lot of vegetarian options so I thought I would try it but it's missing flavor. Added basil would make all the difference.
4,"Excellent lunch here.  The gulf fingers were lightly fried and delicious it was accompanied by fried lemons but a little too bitter for me so I just clung to the fish- sooo good.
Then we shared a chicken salad which was perfection on a plate.

What was more impressive and fabulous was our server!  As a former waiter I can honestly say this was top notch service.  Do recommend and will return!"
4,"Hole in Wall...Excellent All u eat king crab legs and snow crab legs for around $55 or so. You can get them steamed, w garlic, old bay... such a great deal! And the baked mac n cheese...wow! Ice tea is great also"
4,"This place never disappoints me, LOVE THIS PLACE!!! Food is great, service great...the margaritas are soooo good and it's fresh lime juice and a not a sour mix finally a place that makes margaritas the way they are suppose to be made and it's very clean...LOVE the patio can't wait to go back"
4,"This is a great spot for quality phó, salads, and Vietnamese sandwiches. I got a bowl of steak and meatball phó, Vietnamese papaya salad, and fried egg rolls. The picture doesn't do justice. The bowl was deep. The broth was nice and clean. The papaya salad was fresh. The egg rolls as good as I have had. But their service and friendliness is par none. I will be back!!"
4,"BBQ is delicious!  Sides are delicious!  Staff is super friendly!  Definitely my new favorite bbq place!  Great, now I'm hungry."
0,"HA! Another #fail for Exton Nissan. They mailed me a 30% off coupon that ""must be used with 15 days"" before the expiration date. Well today is 4/21/2017 and the expiration date is 4/24/2017. I find it very hard to believe that even USPS took since 4/10/2017 to deliver this to me. This just adds to my list of reasons why I will never go back."
4,"Always receive great, timely service at Tires Plus in Carmel.  Irene helped me on this occasion to replace a flat tire.  She was informative, gave me suggestions on need for new wiper blades, but no high pressure sale.  Love these folks!"
3,Good food.  Breakfast burritos are pretty good.  I just wish they used potatoes instead of French fries.
4,"Fruit bowl is not a bowl of melon with a pineapple chunk. Shelly's has my favorite fresh fruits-strawberries, blueberries and bananas - beautifully presented and sweet."
4,"I never thought I'd say this, but the frose and meatloaf are beyond delicious! Highly recommend! Love everything about 13th Street!"
4,I went to Pure Massage today for my first time! I called for a last minute appointment and they were able to take me immediately and I booked with Michael. He was amazing. My back had so many knots from working out and I had a lot of pain in my shoulder from a knot and he was able to relieve the pain. I highly recommend this place.
0,I came here for a poutine and they had no gravy. I came here last night at the same time. It's truly a disappointment when I come here almost daily. 3 meals a day almost.
2,"This is the Publix right off of Royal Oaks, and it is just fine as groceries stores go.  Very friendly employees and the store is orderly and clean.  Decent selection of locally made craft beers in the beer section."
1,"I really have no idea how they hav gotten such high ratings. They double booked me and I felt they overcharged me. 

I gave an extra star for Anthony because he did a great job.

The dispatcher was rude. Very poor customer service. 

     ,     ."
4,"If you're visiting Nashville or even live here you have to stop into this place. Not only is the chicken tenders, pimento Mac and cheese, slaw, and banana bread pudding amazing; the prices are great too, I got all of this plus a sweet tea and a tip was just 19 bucks."
4,"Being just up the street from my house, we decided to try this place for breakfast and WOW.  The place is clean and well maintained.  I had a farmers omlette.  It was the fluffiest one I ever had.  Full of items and very tasty.  The service was very good and even the owner came by the table, which is always a plus for me.  They use Smuckers jam, which to be is a sign of good food.  We loved this place and will be back."
0,"Had to have the sewer line cleaned and inspected for the sale of my home. Shuster's guys came out and video scoped the line and certified it in ""Great"" shape. When the buyer called Bill Shuster to verify the report, he told them NOT TO BUY THE HOUSE because of the condition of the sewer line. He cost a lot of money and aggravation, nearly derailed the sale of the house. He doesn't stand behind his work or his plumbers. Buyer Beware!"
4,"I'm Obsessed with their chai, it's the best ever. The coffee is good too. Most of the staff is really sweet and I love that they remember me and their other regulars, I Love that! It's like Cheers (the bar) for local coffee."
4,Some of the best wings in Bucks County. The chicken quesadilla is delicious. There's not a bad thing on the menu.
4,I got a refill and gel nail repaint from Polish Studio. They did a fantastic job and the place has a modern feeling & really nice looking. The employers are very friendly.
4,The best Indian food I've ever had!  Yummmmmmmmm!!!!!!!!!
2,"Balducci's doesn't have a whole lot of atmosphere and it doesn't have a whole lot of options either. The pizza is fine, good in fact, but at the end of the day, it's just pizza. I would definitely get it to go, but only if you live in the area."
4,"Wow!! Excellent burritos and I'm from CA. Super fresh tortillas made it 5 stars. We got the jerk chicken and signature flying burrito. Both excellent. Started with the bacon beans which might have been to much food, but very much enjoyable after walking through the garden district."
0,"Bad place to get food because they did not get enough sauce and barely and fries, the burger patty was mostly burnt. Never coming to this place again."
3,"Fair pricing for pedicures, staff was nice, things were clean and they do a wax bag on your feet which is a great service that I don't find at many places."
3,Great ice cream but I agree with Jessica on the inadequate limp spoons. How can I enjoy my frozen treat with a bendy spoon??!!
4,"Love this place! The dill popcorn is amazing, the sandwiches are delicious, and the service is great. 5 stars!"
0,Please tell me it gets better than this? New to area and as far as Asian food is concerned the bar is very low. This buffet was terrible. Food was old and tasteless. Looked like health violations all over the place. I don't know how they stay in business. So far most all Asian restaurants here are not good. Where are the foodies? Where does one go for good Asian?
0,"They will drain you for every dollar you have. Nothing but salesman. You can't go for a checkup without getting a minimum $300 bill and at least 3 bottles of medicines. Every visit our dog would get a bottle of antibiotics and anti fungals. After the fourth time, I had to call it quits, and now looking for a new vet. One that cares about the animals and not how much they can get away with charging."
2,The Starbucks is always quick but they are ALWAYS out of food and it's getting ridiculous. No matter what time of day. I'm getting ready to stop coming here.
3,"This is about what you should expect from a Panda Express.  The wait has never been too long for me, I was never disappointed.  The service was never bad.  I would go back whenever I'm in the mood.  Maybe I will go today!"
2,"Very friendly service, wonderful atmosphere however the food was soso. I had a calamari sandwich and nachos as appetizers. Wife had the chicken tacos as she described as being bland."
1,"A friend invited me to this Spot after an event.       
Food was okay...I would say that the food is okay but nothing I would jump to say ""I need to go again""; but if in the area and hungry....maybe.  Waitress was nice and pleasant.  If you are looking for Caribbean Caribbean food, wouldn't suggest here; I think they adapted the menu for American taste palette."
4,Love this FedEx!  Not the easiest to get to with the current construction situation but it's worthwhile when you get excellent service from Kat. She is awesome. Helpful and friendly!  Always enjoy visiting this FedEx location.
0,"The frustration continues! I tried to use their website. While not as difficult to navigate as their automated telephone system, the system does NOTHING!!! Every time I try to chane to mail delivery (their prefered venue) I get an error message that that part of the website is down... this has been going on for A MONTH! If there truly was competion in the industry these idiots would be out of business in 2 seconds. The only reason I have to deal with these people is because I have no choice! I hope I can get a better plan when open enrolment starts."
4,"Love this place. Best Chinese in Williamstown, Sicklerville, Twp...good people. Fast. DELIVERY. ALWAYS SATISFIED. I get delivery once a week. Great #EggFooYoung"
4,Food and services are wonderful! They are friendly and welcome. Definitely will come back.
4,"Group of 6 came during our girls trip.  We absolutely loved this restaurant.  The food and drinks were both amazing. Atmosphere was fun and party like. At one point shots came
Out for the entire restaurant.  DJ on scene was great!"
4,"I've been visiting Nashville for years and I wish we had found The Café sooner! The menu had something different and DELICIOUS for each member of our 11-person-group. It is absolutely lovely on the inside, with plenty of space for groups of all sizes, and the staff were all so sweet and friendly and very quick to bring our food, even on a busy Saturday!! I will definitely go back and bring more friends the next time I visit Nashville!"
0,"Oh my gosh, will someone PLEASE get the sweet girl who works here some help??! She takes all of the orders and fulfills them- with three delivery apps ringing and a line out the door. She called the owner at one point but they clearly did not care. We waited an hour at 8pm. It's DELICIOUS ice cream but poorly run."
4,"Of all the places we ate in Nashville, this was our group's favorite! Pleasing 14 ladies is not a simple feat! The most wonderful pumpkin ravioli with a warm cream sauce... yummy!! Perfectly cooked sweet potatoes and so much more. If you are in to fresh food cooked to perfection, this is the place for you!"
4,"Love this restaurant. It's so cute and a common lunch spot during work. The two things that I think are underrated here are their specialty sodas. I highly recommend the Elderflower Presse soda, as well as the Ginger beer if you like ginger. 

The funniest part of eating here is that every time I go someone thinks the rarebit appetizer is actually a rabbit dish. Haha it's definitely not. Basically it's just bread topped with a mustardy cheese spread and pretty good!"
4,"We had a terrific experience.  Karen was more than awesome.  My daughter and I were traveling with our two dogs and when Karen learned that we were going to leave our dogs with a dog sitter so we could go on the ride, she offered to watch our dogs for us!  Karen was thorough and helpful.  She was kind and generous with her time and knowledge.  The bikes were amazing, the route was fantastic.  We can't wait to go back and do it again!"
0,EXPENSIVE with mediocre service and dirty bathrooms. Disgusting. Will never return. Great job ruining a beautiful view.
2,"Dined here for an office lunch.  We had the back room to ourselves.  Service was prompt and efficient.  It was odd to hear Christmas music pre-Thanksgiving and to see the restaurant in full Christmas trim but, oh well.  I had the special salad (walnuts and some fruit) with grilled chicken.  I had the whole portion which was a good move and was sufficient.
We wandered next door to the country store and loved the wide assortment of specialty foods.  The had some delicious Golden apples, too."
0,"Apple Store in Lakeside Shopping Center is a disappointment that sells wonderful products!  That store is always too crowded with too much frenzied activity, and service is unhelpful.  I've been there 3 times hoping to learn more about using my iPad but their staff is not very knowledgeable and appear nonprofessional.  Alas, I've always left the store feeling DISAPPOINTED."
4,"I had a positively wonderful experience getting my pedicure! My salon attendant was amazing! The treatment was very thorough, relaxing and they took every safety & health precaution. The massage chair was the best ever! The end result was very beautiful feet and overall relaxation! I'm so happy I tried them & I will now be a regular client!"
1,"Wanted a channel added to my package. Called shaw, seems simple. Was told I was 65th in queue, do I want a call back?  Yup sure do!  Call back will take 30-45 mins. Over an hour later I finally get my call back. Told I'm next in line. Over and hour later I finally FINALLY get picked up. Over 2 hours to make a simple change?  Garbage"
4,"I am very happy with my first mobile auto detail from Sunshine. I'll definitely use them again and refer them to anyone looking for a very thorough car cleaning. They did great work, were very safe and respectful during Covid, and my old car looks shiny & new.  Highly recommend them."
4,"Great staff and even better food! cute historic building with a bar in the front with a large dining area in the back. good beer selection, both in bottle and draft, and the service is always great! The bar has darts, golden tee, a skills machine and a jukebox. great place you watch spurts, especially football Sundays when they have cheese steak and burger specials! definitely worth the stop!"
4,I took my English Bulldog here for the first time the other day. They are still keeping social distance and having owners wait in their cars but the staff was amazing. They all said great things about my baby and apologized for not letting me come in. Plus their app is awesome.
3,"This burger place is not bad. I stopped by and tried the Hawaii 5-0 Burger. For the most part, I do like it. The patty has a decent size, the veggies are fresh. The burger is simple, but well made. Lots of flavour! Thumbs up! In my opinion though, I wish they would change the type of buns they use. Not a fan of it. It's kinda dense and a bit dry."
4,"Assuming day after Xmas accounted for the quick seating and service, as it seems this place is typically very crowded. Ordered the St. Charles chicken. I would go out on a limb and say it was one of the best breakfasts I've had. Staff was friendly, and place has a nice laid back vibe. The visit to Ruby Slipper got our trip to N.O. off on the right foot."
2,"Great price, comes with a little kitchenette stocked with dishes, and a huge fridge and stove top oven to complete ur stay. They offer toiletries upon request. My only complaint was the service, sometimes they were rude."
0,"Mother's day 2017
Arrived at 1045 to make sure I could get a table...website said they opened at 11......at 1105 we left. As we were leaving the wait staff was just starting to roll. I have visited this establishment well over a 100 times it appears they have lost any concern for there customers. Went to las margaritas on oracle a little further but we'll worth the drive"
4,I have always had good everything here. The food is hot. The salsa is always fresh and it reminds me of eating in Puerto Peñasco
4,"First time there,  the chic parm sandwich might have been the best I've ever had.  I got the the thumbs up from my partner as well.  We will be going back!"
1,"Do not trust their website, as the proprietors will scrap half the menu, but not update the site to reflect the change."
4,Love the Perenn Bakery here. It feels like a part of the Malibu Countrymart got transported to Reno. Very posh and so excited for the rest of the development to open!! Kudos to Rancharrah - the view of the main house is gorgeous.
3,Service here was fast and friendly. I ordered the Oysters Blue-Diana and they were great. I would recommend this place to all my friends.
0,"the worst place to stay, the manager is piece of shit.. I am not sure if it is the owner or the manager but he made me leave because I was changing a tire"
4,BEST BURGER I'VE EVER HAD. Super huge and it was the smallest burger they had. It was delicious and flavorful.
3,Besides the 3 hours wait on every holiday possible. The prices are crazy. but over all it tastes fantastic. Hence the lineup around the block. :)
4,"Great new Thai restaurant in town! Diverse menu, with an excellent vegan menu too. Food can be spicy so let them know your spice level. Friendly service, nice ambiance. Highly recommend!"
4,"Such a wonderful business. The owners are very responsive and such great people that genuinely care about your pet. So happy we found this place to board our dog when we're out of town. We were sad to find out that the other kennel our dog was boarded at prior to this, just left the dogs in the kennels all day. Here, the dogs get to run, go outside and also socialize with other animals. It's great to not have to worry about my dog while out of town because I know he's in great hands here. Thank you uncle fredies!"
0,Poor example of theater management Got to the theater and the smell of floor sealant permeated the entire building to the point of nausea you don't do this during the middle of the day when you were showing movies. We had get our money back and leave.
4,"Glad I had a chance to drop by this place. Really pleasant and down-to-earth owners. Needed some of my dad's old wide ties altered to more of slick, skinny ties because my mom was planning to throw them away. The price was very reasonable compared to some of the prices from internet tailors. 
The owner is an expert hand-tailor as she altered the ties to match my body shape and she was able to finish 15 ties in a day! Amazing professional service. 10/10 coming back again."
4,"So impressed with their service! Friendly, fast and efficient. I even came in a few minutes late from my scheduled smog appointment. Fernando was so understanding and we probably got in and out of their under 30min. Definitely recommend. Also the receptionist was very friendly as well."
2,Service is very slow. Tom Kha Kai that my wife ordered smelled so bad I had a hard time finishing my meal until it was removed from our table. The Three Buddies was pretty good  but the crab fried rice was nothing special.
4,"Gotta love Glory Cloud Coffee!! First off, it has been such an inviting and welcoming atmosphere every time that I've come in, and the staff are incredibly kind and helpful! It is also a great place to host events and meetings. And last, but certainly not least, the artisan and craft-roasted coffee from the best coffee beans around the world (Colombia, Brazil, Ethiopia, Kenya) are absolutely delicious - and they'll even make a latte or macchiato to please your palate!"
4,"We had a party of 8 for a nice nice out.  Karel, our server, was friendly and made us feel the southern hospitality I expected and hoped to experience.  The appetizers and drinks came out quickly and our dinners were all excellent.  The food was high quality & made to perfection.  I would definitely go again and will recommend the restaurant to all my friends!!!"
4,"Another awesome pizzadelicious this weekend!  Greg and Mike's Homemade Meatball pizza was a great addition to my Sunday night!!!

I have tried all the other supposedly premium pizza joints in town.  Slice, Naked, Theo's, NY....not nearly as good as Pizzadelicious.  NY is probably the closest and is my choice for a mid-week snack.  But when Sunday rolls around, Pizzadelcious is all that is acceptable."
4,Looks can be deceiving from the outside it looks like an old home but once you go in it is feels like you are in a Greek grandma's kitchen. Me and my husband both got a Gyro and they were actually really good in the Greek salad was a real Greek salad. I am from Tarpon Springs Florida the southern Greek capital and it reminded me of home. I will be back in eating the food again!!!
4,What a great place to purchase a car. Everyone was helpful and knowledgeable. Robin Tidd was especially great. The process was quick and enjoyable. Thanks you Perry Ford Lincoln. Buy Made in the USA.
0,IM NOT EVEN THE TYPE TO LEAVE REVIEWS. One of the black security Guards were harassing me and my friend about being in our friends section they paid for. They put their hands on us and were very disrespectful. Even after we paid for our own section and bottle. Overly priced. Shit music if you like Latin music or new age pop this is for you. If your black don't come here they are racist. Definitely better clubs in the area to spend money at this was not it. Not worth hype
4,Took my girl friend here for a spa treat and we both love the deluxe spa pedicure. My girl friend who visit me from Florida said the technician Lena gave her a very good feet massage. I forgot my manicurist name but not bad at all. Nice and clean salon.
4,"Good beer, good pizza, and good atmosphere. It's not a cheap pizza place, but it definitely doesn't taste like cheap pizza. I also admire the chutzpah necessary to open right at the beginning of a worldwide shutdown due to COVID-19."
2,"Went to Tini's last month, they have only to go orders which I wasn't sure that was a thing. I ordered a strawberry negroni with rum instead of gin for they didn't have gin. It was actually really good! It was strong but the strawberry smoothie was a good balance. Once we placed our order, we sat in the Tini's outdoor patio area. It was nice to sit but soon got crowded and we decided to leave. Overall, we enjoyed our drinks."
0,how can I give 0 stars ? seriously I have had better donairs from gas stations ! and the gas stations were cleaner ! it's a shame as queen donairs used to be good . the owners used to have some pride and passion in their business . not anymore
2,"Tried this pho place on a whim after passing by it on Campbell. The pho had a good flavor and the service was fast, although it was pretty empty for a Saturday morning. My only complaint from this encounter is that the waiter checked our cat cards for the 15% student discount and then did not apply the discount to our check. He had already run the card and we never got the discount. Hopefully their staff will be more seasoned next time."
4,"Great service, welcoming environment, friendly staff, and great food. Really nice decor and new bar. Will come back."
2,A convenient place to grab a coffee if you live in the nations. Their Red Eye will definitely give you that extra jolt in the mornings. The Full Moon and Sea Salt Caramel Latte are some of my favorites and can help satisfy any sweet cravings. The consistency and quality has lagged lately. Hopefully this is just a miss. They are definitely one of Nashville's go to's for a unique coffee experience.
1,"It's a shame a place like Jasmine Rice in CC closes down while this place continues to exist. 

The spicy fried rice had barely any spice or flavor and the rice was mushy. Probably the blandest Thai food I've tried out of Jasmine Rice, Circles, Sawatdee, Erawan, My Thai, and Lemon Grass...

I appear to be in the minority however as this place generally gets good ratings."
4,I finally got a haircut after a year without. YeAh I was very shaggy. My stepson had tried this barbershop and was very pleased so I tried it as well. I was extremely pleased with the haircut. It was much better than the cuts I've received from the chain stores. Just as information they don't take credit or debit so remember to bring cash. I highly recommend this barbershop and will definitely return !!!
4,Can not say enough nice things about FFK-9. Staff is excellent.  Owners are amazing.  Always willing to help you with your pet.  It is such a good feeling when you drop your pet off for play day and they can't hardly wait to get inside to play.   Taking Billy (our dog) to FFK-9 for training and play days is the best decision we made in his up bringing.
3,"Cafe passe gets 4 stars partially for the interior/exterior alone. I love the back patio. It is spacious and calming. There is just something about it that I love. Otherwise the drinks and food are decent-nothing great, nothing awful, pretty standard. I like the atmosphere so I will continue to come here. Service is usually friendly (9 times out of 10)."
0,"Took them 15 minutes just to greet us after we were seated. Spoke to the manager who apologized and took our order (two burgers) and gave us a $10 gift card. After an other 15-20 minutes later we got our food. Which was good but the service is terrible. Asked for the checked which took an other five minutes. After five more minutes got our check. 

It took us an hour and forty minutes from start to finish.  

Will not be coming back here."
2,Just ordered food for the first time minute year or two and the quality of the food that I received was subpar the burger that I received was a hockey puck and not even on a burger rolls and rolls burn the cheesesteak had no flavor and it tasted burnt Are used to love this place don't know what happened new owner trying to save money but quality food has diminished exponentially so sorry
4,"Cornival Popcorn is outstanding. My review is delayed however They supplied popcorn for our wedding last June, and guest are still talking about the popcorn. The service was outstanding meeting our needs for popcorn for 200 guest. They even gave us a complimentary bucket of butter popcorn for placing a large order which our guest devoured also. Definitely a Hidden Gem @ Washington Square Mall."
4,"If you want steak, this is where you go. Nothing fancy, no extra fluff, just great steak. 

With that being said, service is mediocre, everyone is nice. It's one of those hole in the wall places that's a staple to Tucson. The steak is why you come back. I don't expect to be treated like a princess. When I want really good steak, I don't want to have to be fake nice to get it."
4,Whoa!  Food Truck.  Grilled burger served between a grilled cheese.  Booya.  'nuff said.
4,AMAZING SERVICE!!!!! I recommend this to anyone wanting to do something fun in Tampa! We were on Shawn and Carlos' boat and had an amazing time. No complaints AT ALL.
4,"I have been doing Zumba faithfully for 30 years. In only 3 beginner Mantra classes, I have noticed definition in my stomach and upper thighs that I have always wanted.  Plus, with Mantra, you get started right away in a class and don't have to pay for private classes first. Couldn't be happier."
3,"The rooms are very comfortable, very clean, updates, I love the spacious shower. The service is very nice, customer service is great, the eating area is very accommodating, everything looks very elegant, appealing and updated. 

How ever.... the food needs to be improved tremendously. The food quality is very poor."
3,"Everyone's really nice and it's the only place I've ever tanned. However, the hours can be hard to work around and you have to wait to get a bed when someone's getting a spray tan."
2,"Ordered the corned beef hash. Overall, an average meal. While each of the components was cooked properly, the dish lacked seasoning."
4,"I didn't get any pictures, but we LOVED the Mac we got. We had the jalapeño Mac and the pulled pork Mac! They were super creamy and delicious. And apparently the base Mac is vegan? It was incredible! As a non vegan I couldn't tell!"
3,Always good food. Tough to decide between the various options. Macaroni and cheese is fantastic.  This place gets dinged for service but I've been here probably 10 times visiting on business and it is always pretty good. The food gets the 4 stars.
4,"We were a party of four, arrived early to get a place on the deck.  Gorgeous evening, we started off with cold beer.  Our server was busy, but very attentive.  All four of us had the grouper dinner and it was cooked to perfection!  The tater tots were crispy, cole slaw was lightly dressed and flavorful, the potato salad was to die for!  It was a fun and delicious evening!"
4,"I'm stoked! Found a good dentist! Yay! Office staff were all very pleasant too!!
I just moved here from LA not to long ago. I've checked out other dentists in Reno and Sparks. I'm so glad I was recommended this place from a friend. It's Lemmon Valley and not to far from Sparks. What a relief. Had a tooth pulled and filling. It was quick and painless. Thank you so much Lemmon Valley Dental!!!"
4,"Hi. Just go. It's incredible. Get Ryley as your server, she will absolutely make your night."
4,"This place!!! Omg the best vegan food in town! 
My heart just gets so happy when I know I'm going to go here! The food is so delicious, healthy all Whole Foods plant base! 
I usually get the curry bowl and my husband usually gets the mighty bowl. They are so good. I can't wait to go again and try a different bowl. They all look so insanely good. 
This place is inside the Antioch university second floor. Meaning you have to go inside the university to find this hidden gem."
0,Total dump. Bad service. Weird music. Aggressive staff who steals your unfinished items off your table in an effort to clean up before you are even finished.
4,Took my mom on an airboat tour and we had a blast! Cameron was our guide/captain; he was very knowledgeable and entertaining. It was a beautiful and warm'ish day so we saw quite a few alligators. Would recommend these folks to anyone looking to explore outside the city.
0,Terrible customer service.  The blueberry scone tastes awful - cold and stale.  Do they leave these in the case for 3-4 days?  I should stick to my rule to always eat at Mise n Place.
0,The most dry nansty place every I had the  chicken rice never again. It was horrible taste just like it looks dry and nansty and don't ask for a refund they will exchange it for some horrible red beans and rice on all scale from 1 to 10 I give this place a 1 they keep the tables clean
4,"This place rocks! I've been here twice and have learned so much from them about cat care and diet. Everyone took the time to show me around and offer me information and advice. 
They have a selection of excellent products for cats and dogs that can't be found at the big name places.  When I checked out, they signed me up for some pretty sweet rewards programs for a couple of the brands I was buying. 
Do your pets a favor and hit this place up!"
4,"Cooper's is next to Jakes. Cooper's is a cool wine bar; Jake's is the nicer sit down restaurant.. Cooper's had a great happy hour 5-7pm (cheap beers, wines, pizzas, appetizers) - on Friday they have ""crabby hour"" with crab pizzas and crab mac&cheese. Check this place out."
1,"There is no wifi at all in this hotel.  If you need wifi, stay somewhere else.

Otherwise, the place is okay.  They're in the middle of doing renovations right now (Oct 2019).  My room had a brand new renovation and was beautiful & clean.  The bed was somewhat hard, but I slept okay on it."
2,Good food. Great key lime pie! Our order was a little messed up but was quickly resolved. The service was great.
4,I can't rave enough about them. Congrats for making list of top 100 beer bars in US!!
2,"Good quality vegan food although I wish they had french fries to go with their sandwiches and wraps instead of corn chips. Also, my buffalo wrap portion size was too small for around $8 and I was still hungry. Indy needs more vegan restaurants however, and it's great that this option exists."
2,"1) VERY LOUD!!! - Do not expect to hear anything in this place.
2) Good, local ingredients, however the crust gets very soggy quickly. Several times throughout my meal, I commented that the pizza is quite soggy
3) BYOB is nice
4) good service - friendly and accomodating"
0,"Biggest waste of money I've spent on my business. 
Was going to have them do the website but it was the slowest process. Take your money and spend it on any other part of your business. I did sign up for the reviews also but only thing I want to do is get out of my contract. Last time I saw the sales person was the day I signed the contract. Trust me I have nothing to gain with HIBU but you still have the potential to lose. Stay away!

3,"Continues to be a great choice in my mind. Have been twice recently and fully enjoyed both meals. Both the pasta and main courses have been excellent. Last time in we got a cheese/meat plate and the longhots for an appetizer. Both were fantastic and I would highly recommend. Wine and drink selection is good and not overpriced. Service has been hit or miss but nothing bad. 

I ate at both Avalon and Mercato this week and would chose Avalon every time for almost every reason- food, drinks, service. I did think Mercato was more interesting inside."
0,Terrible service...signs said summer toys and infaltibles. ..typo on every sigm...50% off. ..I took a child's summer chair up to buy...it rang up 25% off so I said I was sorry but didn't want to buy it...the saleswoman picked it up and slammed it down behind the counter!  It would be nice if they marked prices first of all and common courtesy shouldn't be to much to expect!
4,"I thought I had given this 5 stars when I posted last year. Sorry, but correcting now. My granddaughter visited again and the first thing she wanted to do was to return to South Creek Pizza. We went late afternoon and had a wonderful and pizza again. Did not disappoint and still top notch service by the wait staff. It is now on my list as a favorite eatery and favorite environment and favorite recommendation to friends!"
1,Was gambling at silver legacy when I noticed a pan roast sign and it sounded soo good. We ordered the ultimate pan roast and let me tell you there was nothing ultimate about it. It was watery and sour. All the seafood were tiny little pieces with big shells. Ive experienced the real pan roast in Vegas and this does not compare at all. The reason for not being a  completely horrible restaurant is because the raw oysters were pretty fresh besides having one bad one and the salmon on mashed potatoes was cooked really good and was actually tasty.
4,"If you're looking for somewhere for delicious sushi or chophouse steaks, this is the place to go! Everything was so fresh, perfectly cooked, and came out beautifully plated. The manager Robin is so friendly and really cares about your dining experience. This is a great place for locals and tourists alike! The atmosphere is fun and the energy is lively. I will recommend to everyone!"
4,Had to stop for our way out of town on a road trip to get this world famous Muffuletta sandwich. For those of you who don't know one half of the sandwich easily feeds two people with normal appetite. Cannot beat the olive salad and my mouth is watering even thinking about it 12 hours later. Wonderful people to talk to lots of History here and must do when you're in New Orleans
4,Why not. So I been a couple times and have gotten the same thing on a different bagel each time and has been satisfied every time. The ladies here are nice and patient. The bagels seem fresh as I have them lightly toasted. I like the variety and even seen the cinnamon bun bagel for the first time and it looked and even tasted like a sticky bun. Well done people...well done! I enjoy that this place is near my job as I crave a really breakfast sandwich from time to time and that place 'America Runs On' just doesn't cut it.
2,"Food was cool. Nothing that would make me come back,but it's has a great late Happy Hour"
4,"Very impressive little place. I had the Kota, and it was phenomenal. The service, the atmosphere, and c the attention to detail were all top shelf. Hope to visit this place again sometime."
4,"The inside is spacious and awesome. You can see the chefs cooking through observation glass which is cool. The service is excellent. Good selection of draft beers and cocktails. Food was really good; I highly recommend the shishito peppers, Brussels sprouts, and the gnocchi. Would recommend!!"
1,"Ordered Turkey and Cheese Primo today(9/18/21). I must say it was not that great! The roll was falling apart, the tomatoes were not fresh, and the way the sandwich was made was down right horrible. 
I would praise this location to get a GREAT hoagie all the time, but lately it being falling off with freshness of sides and the quality of the hoagie. You guys need to do better!!!! I'm so disappointed, waste of $17 dollars and the 45 minute drive,...ugh!"
4,"First off, are they going through some opening, growing pains? Yep! No denying that but they are quickly fixing the kinks. 

Second,  the food is really good. Their pizza is some of, if not the best in Plainfield. Their Stromboli is amazing. The cannoli is done well and their breadsticks are outstanding

Give them a chance and support while they get on their feet. Plainfield needs a spot like this!"
3,"Worth the trip just for the guacamole, but the food is really good up and down the menu. For us, it's a regular stop every time we're in SB. Only downside is the format: Order and pay, then hope to find a table that fits your party. And if you want another glass of wine, you go back to the counter, order and pay again. A bit of a hassle, but worth it for the great food."
3,Amazing massage while my gel mani was getting done. $60 for a gel mani and pedi wasn't terrible but a little high in comparison to other places in the area. Last time I was there my gel mani lasted over two weeks so I went back and service was consistently good both times. Pedicure was good too. Long massage time!
2,"Parking here is a bit steep at $9 a day in my opinion but it's comvenient if you have no one to take you to the airport.

If you're lucky (which is usually the case) you can score a covered parking spot. After that it's about a 200 meter walk to the airport."
4,"This group of professionals are the best. Dr Fong is the most caring doctor I have ever worked for and encountered. And the staff is awesome. I wish them a long and successful furure,
Jennifer"
2,"The last time I went, there was a scheduling issue.  They actually had booked me one week in the future.  Yet no one figured this out until halfway through my haircut, when the person who was actually booked for that time showed up (late, I might add).  They made me feel terrible for the mistake, as if I was intentional in showing up at the wrong time and refusing to consider that it may have been their fault in the scheduling error.

Their work is good, but all I can say is confirm all appointments."
4,"Always a good time!!!
Delicious!!!
Fast!!
Friendly!!
Great menu range!!
Defiantly get the summer roll ap!"
4,"Went to the soft opening on Friday night.  Awesome pizza, great atmosphere and was real excited for the owners to finally be able to open their doors.   Look forward to many more trips to this great neighborhood restaurant."
4,"Love this bar!  It has a fun but sophisticated vibe and a delicious cocktail menu. Select craft and other beers and a nice wine list.  Wonderful cheese selection from the famous, stunning cheese cart.  This is a great place for a date or a night out with friends- the low noise level is great for conversation but the atmosphere is still energetic."
4,"Last night we went to Mr. Ed's on St. Charles, the food was great. I had the a Redfish Maison and it was perfectly seasoned. My friend had the dozen oysters half Bienville half Rockefeller. He said they were better than Drago's. I don't eat oysters so...anyway give them a try you won't be disappointed."
4,"What a fun evening! Aided by a bottle of Chianti. Great venue with an intimate group of 12. We were not a group. But I think this is a great platform for a fun corporate team building event or other types of parties. 
Thanks Anne"
4,"Came on a weekday early afternoon, got seated right away and then... Holy mother of Benedicts, Batman!  I ordered the Beaux Bridge Benedict at Stanley, and proceeded to die of utter fatassery as I consumed it.  The rich hollandaise sauce, the perfectly poached eggs, the fried oysters (optional), so much savory goodness on one plate.  Thank you fellow Yelpers for pointing this gem out."
1,"There has got to be a better bike shop in Indy!  Seems okay for kids bikes, but not the place for anyone with a bike fetish."
4,Wow! I haven't been here in a couple years and I just don't remember it being THIS good. It was amazing! I had the chicken fried chicken and the bacon mac and cheese and fried pickles to start! Omg comfort food to the max and I scraped the plate! I am in such a happy mood after this meal! If your looking for comfort food with a laid back authentic nashville atmosphere look no further because this is the place! Down home cooking done right! 5 star and I don't give that lightly!
4,These folks have done most of my new home buyers' homes in Durham Farms.  They are fairly prices and do a great job of installing in a timely fashion.  Cody has been helpful and responsive so I always ask for him.
3,"This is a great bar,  the bartenders and the elaborate cocktails were amazing,  however the Debbie Davis band begging for tips every other song really cheapens the place.  Ms. Davis even came around to each table with a bucket asking for tips each hour. 

When one guy said he did not have any cash, she directed him to the ATM machine nearby."
1,I just went to Hong Kong and loved their egg waffles. These were really disappointing. I actually got 2 of them and threw them out. They were just so so dry and fell flat for me. It almost tasted stale but I saw them making them fresh. The pork bun was horrible. Friendly service.
4,"Awesome atmosphere, food and drink. Friendly owners and staff. Great experience and dinner- will definitely be back! Only took 20 minutes from downtown STL to get there too!"
4,"The real deal.  Excellent, super tasty BBQ.  Everything I tried was full of flavor.  I loved the smoked chicken, the pulled pork, and the sides of cabbage (just a little sweet) and BBQ beans.  I'll be back."
4,"These guys are awesome, it feels like the most perfect small business from the 80s. You walk in and instantly you feel like you are long-lost friends. I love Amazon as much as anyone, and when it comes to musical stuff I make an effort and will go out of my way to make sure this company gets my money. They are that great"
4,Great food great service. Didn't like the dipping oil. It had no taste but an oil taste. Would go back again.
0,"BEWARE the $2 bump charge per drink if you order on the rocks. The fee, I was told, is for the extra pour they give when you order on the rocks. The bar staff neglected to tell me when i ordered. That brought the charge up to $9.50 per drink and it wasn't top shelf stuff. I feel I should have been told when I placed my first drink order about the bump fee and let me decide of I want the extra pour."
0,"DOES NOT TAKE THE RESERVATION MADE ONLINE    - WHEN YOU GET TO THE RESTAURANT. 

Made reservations for 8:00, got there at 7:50ish and was told they don't take reservations and would be put at the bottom of the list  BUT IT'S ONLY A 30 MINUTE WAIT!!!! 

Why the heck are you accepting reservations on YOUR website, Open Table, and from the Maps app then?"
2,"Service was terrible. Only one person for poke and one for ice cream. We bought rolled ice cream, which was very good! But attendant was slow. He also didn't change gloves, and didn't dry them after washing hands. 

There was also no air conditioning on... and if you are serving poke, you ought to have a/c on! It was hot in there!!"
3,"The cocktails here are AMAZING. I loved the spicy Marg and couldn't have just one! Their guacamole is fabulous and very unique with serrano peppers, pomegranate, jicama, and pumpkin seeds! The poblano fundido is stuffed with chorizo and queso-it's the best thing on the menu! The ribs were so tender and fell right off the bone!"
2,"Good atmosphere, mediocre food. Bufala ricotta bruschetta was inedibly salty and the bread was dry and stale soaked in oil. It was like brick. We were surprised that they expected people to actually eat this. I wonder if they were extra stale because we went later in the evening? Jalapeno bucatini was OK. Roasted lamb shoulder was like shredded lamb pancake, which was again OK. The best part about this restaurant was the ambience and service was good. Food was really not so good."
4,"If I had $30 a week that I wanted to spend on coffee then I would most like likely spend it at Starbucks. I've tried other chains and a few other private businesses and honestly Starbucks is the only place that gets it PERFECT every time. I never have to add anything else to it. Customer service is always quick and friendly and the coffee is always a perfect drinkable temperature immediately upon receipt. Most places you have to wait a few minutes for it to cool down. This particular location has a large, cool outdoor area perfect for lounging around and enjoying your beverage. I'm a fan."
4,"My go to restaurant. Amazing service, super clean and delicious ingredients. I eat here around 4 times a week and it never gets old!"
2,"I ordered
the drunken noodles to go.  The takeout woman took it upon herself to add 25percent tip on my bill.  The portions are about 1/2 the size of other thai places.  Spice was decwnt."
3,"Sunday afternoon not crowded waitress was attentive, food was served as ordered. Overall a good experience."
0,"The food was ok, not the best not the worst. My only issue is the staff. The owner never gave us a SMILE ."
4,Best Mexican in recent times. Came across this on my road trip to Santa Barbara. This place is very close to the wharf. On the house chips and salsa. Liked the variety of sauces they accompany the chips with. The green sauce was the best. Shredded chicken tacos was the best. Don't forget to add mezcal magic to your margaritas.
2,"Love the Sauce on Campbell, best thin crust pizza in town. Picked up a pizza at this new location and it did not look very appetizing. It was a mushroom pizza and the mushrooms were all clumped together, the pizza looked a little undercooked, no color at all. It tasted ok, but we were expecting more."
0,Horrible. Filthy and unsafe. Room smelled horrific and there was hair everywhere. The toilet still had poop in it and to top it off it was plugged. Worst stay ever.
4,This Hawaiian and Filipino comfort food is the BOMB! Owners and staff are so wonderful you can tell the food is made with aloha
4,The guys at this location are awesome. Especially Nate! He is very friendly and helpful. Whenever I visit this spot it's always a breeze to ship out my packages.
1,"We had the scallion pancakes, mapo tofu and the dumplings. 

The scallion pancakes were drenched in oil and while they were good, I could only have two before the oil got overwhelming. The dumplings were good, but once again, very greasy. I wish they were steamed instead of cooked in oil. And the mapo tofu we got with a medium level of spice, but it was so spicy! Our server did not bring rice out until we had to ask for it. I feel like for the price I paid, I was expecting better but I was just disappointed with my meal."
4,"The best cake donuts hands down. I've never had a place keep their donuts so moist and delicious. The real star: a blueberry fritter!! I didn't even know these existed...now I can't live without it. 
People in line had been going to this spot for 20-40 years and I can definitely see why. Yum"
4,"Walking up to the restaurant we could smell the food which smelled fantastic. They were very friendly. We ordered and sat down, and before we knew it, the food was already there. We both got the Classic Gyro, which was fantastic. As we ate, the owner was talking with customers who seemed to be regulars. They had a beautiful covered outdoor patio which was very nice. I will definitely be back here some time."
2,"It was fine. Obviously they have many options for vegetarians. But the restaurant seemed very pokey, and the section we were in kept losing power because people would trip on the extension cord... Just didn't seem worth it. The food was interesting- they had some unique combinations, but none were memorable."
3,"Awesome coffee shop! I live in the neighborhood and love Joe's for the coffee and the atmosphere. This is one of my favorite places to get work done as there is almost always seating available and a beautiful view of the park. Baristas are all super friendly

Coffee is good especially for a chain but there are better options nearby (Elixir, Rival Bros) if you're a real coffee snob."
4,"The cutest idea ever!! Absolutely obsessed with my flower bouquet + if I lived here, I would get one every week. The worker who helped me was very kind + helpful when I was creating my bouquet. This definitely brightened my day."
4,"The crab balls are totally amazing!! Very good appetizer, and the black Angel roll was the best one!!"
4,Awesome owners. Amazing tea selection. Home welcoming environment. Definitely going to be the game changer of kava bars in the area.  The Scholar is a great tea that's relaxing as it goes down and gives you energy and focus. Highly recommend coming here.
4,"I've been to just about every Chinese restaurant in this area. Literally none of them can compete with this place. It looks like a small family business and they are so good at what they do. Because of COVID-19 they shut down temporarily, which really bummed me out. The first day they reopened for curbside, I swear most of the town of Lebanon was there to get some food. They've always been so nice and I've never received bad food from them. 10/10 any day."
4,"So good!!! We came during a really busy time and maybe an hour before closing, but the service was still great. Not only did our server take care of us, but the hostess also walked by every table checking on each customer. 

I got the yellow curry fried rice with chicken and it was HUGE!  Packed with lots of flavor too! My fiancé got the panang mole and that was amazing, totally would not have thought to combine those two. We'll definitely be back. 

I will say it took a bit for the food to come out, but it was well worth the wait."
4,"So I just dropped off my husband's truck tire to be repaired, and I am AMAZED at how nice, quick, and helpful everyone was!  Literally every single person I came into contact with, both on the phone and in person, was incredibly kind and cheerful. I haven't picked up the tire yet, but I wanted to write this before I forgot. I feel like having this many awesome people in one spot deserves some recognition!"
0,"Woah!!! Don't do it!!! I know it CHEAP!!! But don't do it to yourself or your family!!!!! Lol!! It's terrible!!! Old!! Run down!! Dark! Unkept!! The bathroom door didn't close!! 

There were three cars in the parking lot and her put us in the last room on the thirst floor!!

It's icky!!

Dirty towel!!!!"
4,"Customizable, soo yummy n fresh I crave these!! Perfect breakfast or snack, I ordered online & it was ready very fast very satisfied"
4,Always a good experience here either taking my wife's car for service or how flawless it is to get into a new car...just took delivery on Friday of my new toy..amazing service not only from my sales guy Andrew who is beyond knowledgeable and super nice but frank in the finance office and Gary who got all my paper work and credit app filed within minutes ....all I had to do was show up and get my keys ..thanks again guys I'll always recommend Bmw of Devon
3,"Recently opened up near my place of work. Very clean place, with an excellent variety of food. They also have an area where they will cook up food, as well as a sushi bar. Reasonably priced: I think it was between $8-$9 for an all you can eat buffet lunch."
4,Our family went today and our boys had a great time!  It was neat to see some rare and extinct animals!
4,"Brunch Buffet. Go. Go now.

Worth every penny.

That's it. That's the whole review. Please see photos and videos - it is absolutely worth the wait (if there is one), but grab a reservation for the best experience!

P.S. The bathroom is VERY selfie-friendly, LOL. Gorgeous dressing room lighting and all."
2,"salads, soups and breadsticks - trademark.

service is always good for all our get togethers.

better setup than some other og near by"
4,This place is flat out AMAZING. The hummus is perfect. Rich and creamy and seasoned very well. The Pita is cooked fresh and you'll need/want an extra. Definitely add the egg... who would have thought!? I went with the cucumbers over my hummus and the smokiness to them was great! I'll definitely be back and here for lunch May times!
4,I've been going to Dharam Karma for the past 5 years.  I wouldn't trust anyone else with my eyebrows!  They are the best AND such a reasonable price.  It is so nice to get out of the city and not get ripped off for threading.  Love this place!
2,"healthy-ish food, but pretty dry and kind of bland sandwiches."
3,"I was down from Brooklyn visiting my family in Haddonfield, and desperately needed a decent haircut and color. I was weary of trying someplace unknown, but had read a few reviews on yelp and thought I would try Bauhaus. I went to Metta who was awesome. She talked over what I wanted, and took plenty of time with me. I came out with a great cut that I love, and highlights that are better than any I have gotten all these years living in NY. The price was reasonable, and I would definitely recommend the place to a friend."
4,"an institution.  love the cup, love the bloddy mary bar in the lobby on sundays (make your own with TONS of amazing ingredients). love club congress for optimist club on thursdays."
4,"Amazing food! I had the omlette option #1 which had a basil buttermilk dressing, it was surprisingly delicious. I also ordered a Snickers latte and wow, super good! Overall great food, but you will be waiting for a while so that's something to anticipate."
2,"Three stars - the actual concept is super cool and there are so many different flavors to mix! However, the boba is hit or miss and depending on what flavor combos you choose, some of them can taste a bit boring and repetitive. I got mango and milk tea and couldn't really taste the mango, but my sister got avocado and earl grey and I could definitely taste both! However, the actual shop is super cute and clean and definitely worth a visit!"
3,"Butchers Kitchen serves up their own style of BBQ/CharBQ. My trip there today was good. Nice and smokey, tender brisket with all the BBQ sauce you want. Sides were good but not great and the food came out pretty slow as usual.
I do like this place and will continue to eat here. It's good and the price is right in line with every other BBQ place in town."
3,Always fast service and the often remember the order of regulars.
1,"I don't usually go to Gina's, but was really craving an Italian salad tonight.  Super bummed when I got home to discover that they forgot the meat on my salad and on my husband's pasta.  It was really disappointing to say the least.  I guess I should have opened up all the containers and double checked the order before I left, but I was operating under the assumption that the staff would take care to correctly fulfill my order.  Don't know if I'll be back for awhile."
3,"Just a great atmosphere, great location, great tacos and great bartenders and servers! Take out available too! 
As usual, Parking a challenge on Mass Ave - but worth the hassle for sure!"
3,"The drinks, service and decor are what make this place. The food is good...nothing amazing but solid and very reasonable in price."
3,Our first time to try out the place. There was a line and they only had limited food left as they were near closing but decided to try out our luck. Ordered the pide and the doner. The beef pide was my favorite. Great  customer service.
4,I went to get a refill today and couldn't be happier!  Henry was professional and pleasant and did an excellent job on my nails.  I would definitely recommend this salon and can't wait to go back next week for a pedicure.
4,One of the best museums I've ever been to. Exceptional collection of the artist's work and building itself is fashionable and trendy. Well done.
4,"We were headed to Pinky's but it was closed this Sunday. So...this was our second choice and glad we chose it. The coffee could have come a bit quicker but they were busy so I understood.

The Hangover was good, very good. It needs some sort of bread on the side as the sauce is incredible. The pancakes are huge and delicious. 

Service was excellent and food to match. A+ for the daily dose. 

Our server was Victoria and she was great. Smiling through the whole service. 

We will be back."
4,Amazing pizza at a fair price! I love having a spot to visit in Kenner! The gelato is always a plus!
4,Wonderful little place the staff is fantastic and the food is absolutely delicious! Highly recommend
4,"What a great place to have a great meal and enjoy a cocktail. My husband rarely orders bourbon old fashions because makes them at home exactly like he likes them. This place he said should have 10 stars! The service was great, the drinks were exactly as expected and the food is really good! That was another shock! E let the folks working at TownePlace to inform future guests, swing by 1916 Irish Pub where they will be greeted with a friendly staff and well tended to throughout the visit. Wished this place was in my neighborhood."
0,"Way over priced for average at best seafood seafood. That wasn't the biggest problem, as servers were more interested in talking to each other than to the customers. Not a good experience."
2,"I'm a special education teacher and I found the selection to be pretty decent. However, I found the staff to be somewhat rude. Someone recommended School Sales & Service in Gallatin to me and I found their selection to be just as good and the staff was much more pleasant!"
0,Went in to get my nails and a pedicure around 530 and they said they were closed because they had to go to a party when business hours say they're open till 7. Never going back!
4,"The service is excellent, the food was amazing.  The attention to detail regarding food allergies was beyond reproach.  Thank you for an amazing meal."
4,"We are members at this great theatre on the Ave of The Arts In Philadelphia. The shows have been well done dealing both fun a challenging topics. We recently viewed the ""Outgoing Tide"" which was well done and a great topic.
The seats are comfortable and the people are extremely helpful and pleasant. If you subscribe to the theatre you receive unlimited exchanges and discounted parking."
3,Great food!  Attentive service. Lacking atmosphere. Needs light music and dimmer lighting for dinner. The bright lights during dinner make it feel like a cafeteria.  Reserve a private room (must be party of 5+) for a fun experience with friends and family.
4,"Awesome staff, and great food . I'm really picky when it comes to food from where I grew up, but these guys are some of the closest to home that I can get."
4,"This place is great.

I'm not sure if the previous reviewers' experiences had to do with pains of getting the restaurant up and going, but I've had nothing but good experiences here.

The food is fantastic.  I found it to have the right amount of kick and never too dry or oily.  I've never had the sushi here, so I can't comment as to its quality.  Unlike a previous reviewer, I wasn't charged for refills.

The decor of the restaurant is very nice and the quality of service was welcome."
2,"This place is overpriced, and decent, however their vegetarian selection is kind of minimal and limited to a few things unless you customize it.  Their drinks are yummy, but also overpriced.  Customer service is usually pretty good.  I'd eat here more often if it wasn't so expensive!"
0,"Bought a smothered super burrito with pork. Excellent except pork was hard as a rock. My daughter bought one, perfect! I almost cracked my tooth. I thought it was just one piece. All the pork was dry and hard. When I called them, I heard them laugh in the background. They offered to refund except I live 7 miles away. I will give them another chance with the knowledge that I will not dive in without checking out the meat first. I wonder if they wanted to get rid of the old meat to me because I am Black, I hope not. I will let you know."
4,Probably the most organized and clean Walmart I've ever been to. Purchased a car battery here for a good price and I'm glad they are open 24 hrs as the battery died at the most inopportune time. Very friendly employees.
3,Always clean and well stocked store. Employees are helpful. Food selection is pretty limited though so I can never really get all of my groceries here. Prices are higher then other stores on most items but everything is fresh in the meat and produce departments.
4,"LOVE, LOVE , LOVE the black beans burger and fish hoagies. Those are my favorites but every time I go, never have a problem with order. I love this place and it's very clean"
4,"I'm giving this planet fitness 5 stars because I've been to the planet fitness on the north side and the Beech Grove site is twice as big, has more equipment, and is better staffed. The guys and gals that work the counter here are extremely friendly and helpful. I know planet fitness gets a bad reputation from kicking out people unjustly but in a year of going here I haven't seen it happen once. For 10$ a month for the basic membership I would highly recommend this gym even if you are really muscular you won't be judged."
4,"Ross at WTW is a super-star and really knows his industry.  No flashy sales tactics - just the straight honest truth and the BEST windows on the market.  The installation was flawless, they were meticulous and left the place cleaner than when they started.  No more outside street noise, lower electrical bills and who thought we would get compliments - I guess our old windows were ugly.  Make sure you ask for Ross."
4,"Allie is a wonderful esthetician! I went to Allie for a chemical peel and her professionalism, knowledge, and kindness made my experience a very positive one. She made me feel completely at ease and answered all of my questions. Thank you, Allie!"
0,"Overwhelmed. Always out of something. The other location in Hendersonville is far superior, don't waste your time!"
4,Trip's is old school diner at its best. The cornbeef hash is homemade and very tasty. Cheese grits are some of the best I have had. Great breakfast place although they have a lunch menu I always order breakfast.
4,I had the pad thai and a thai tea and it was absolutely amazing!!! Best thai around for sure
4,"The Publix pharmacy at this location has been exceedingly helpful and professional in assisting us in resolving an issue we had with our insurance. Brianna went beyond what we would have expected and has resolved the issue for us. 

We have found this to be true for the store, in general. Everyone we have dealt with at this location has had a good attitude and sincere willingness to help."
0,It's just sad. I keep going back and each time the food and or service is dismal. I just had a burger way under cooked didn't eat it and the server never even asked why I didn't eat it. I guess I should have sent it back but I can't be bothered.  Over dressed salads. Prices don't match quality. Great location do they have an owner or manager that care?
4,Awesome experience made all the better by our host and teacher Matt. I had no idea what to expect. We were mixed with another group and played a series of different games.
3,"It's not a dive bar...it's just a bar. 

We stopped in during happy hour, which lasts until 8pm. The happy hour is a selling point since every other happy hour seems to end by 6:30. Another selling point: 2-for-1 mixed drinks during happy hour. And the drinks were big and strong. The crowd was mixed and laid back during the week.

I think this will be one of our go-to places for cheap drinks. Just a great place to hang out and get your drink on without paying an arm and a leg."
1,"Ordered the tomato mozzarella panini. Not a fan. The roasted red peppers make it sour. It was barely warm and not at all melted like a panini should be. It was expensive enough that it should come with fries or a side, but it doesn't. Also, the soda came frozen and exploded."
1,"I'm giving them 2 stars because I love their taco pizza.  However, I was in there tonight and there's a heat index of 100 degrees outside.  They had no running AC.  I waited in there for 15 minutes and I almost passed out.  I went outside to get air.  How do you run a restaurant with no AC?  How's that even sanitary when it comes to cooking food??  I know they never use their ac and their heat.  I'm all for saving money but when a customer almost passes out..  that's a problem."
3,Great service with great food in a low key spot. The appetizers were amazing. The Green Curry we ordered was a bit watered down buy the taste was still kicking. Great food that matches the price.
2,"Let me start by saying that the service here is always good.  Everyone has been friendly so far.  I really WANT to like this place....but the food is just mediocre.  Dry and flavorless.  I've been to Burlington about 3 times and the one in Asbury location 4 times.  The Asbury location has better food.  I hate to complain, but it's the truth.  The Blue Monkey in Merchantville has WAY better food and for way less...  

Hopefully they can work it out, I wanna come back and enjoy the food."
1,"Old, poorly maintained, and not overly clean. Small paid parking lot fills up quickly. Service OK, but inconsistent. Jakey's mussels were good, as were the crab cakes. Upstairs indoors does have AC, but had an odd smell."
4,Breakfast was fantastic! Very fresh and amazing flavors! Owner was extremely pleasant! Would totally recommend this small but very quaint cafe. It's a MUST try.
4,"This stuff is true Thai food cuisine. My grandparents use to live in Thailand and my grandfather gave his approval. Yummy food, good service and it really quaint and homey."
4,"Great local cafe. Very friendly owners who work the counter. Had the French toast and chai tea latte which were both excellent. Everything is cooked to order. You can eat inside at one of the comfy benches, couches or tables or get your order to go. Definitely will be returning to try more dishes."
4,Fantastic chicken!! Everything is amazing!!! A must visit when in town!! Lines are long so be prepared to wait a bit - although they move quickly to get you eating their wonderful food as soon as possible
4,"This was my second visit to The Escape Room and it was SO MUCH FUN. It feels like live Clue without the mystery murder...

We did the 1776 Revolutionary War room and escaped with 9 minutes remaining! Next on my list is the Titanic room. Never let go Jack. 

This is a great team building exercise. I highly recommend for co-working bonding. 

Clean space, helpful employees and they sell beer."
4,Get the Fungus Amongous  It's amazing!! My favorite for sure! Amazing service. The manager is phenomenal!!
4,So many amazing choices. The tacos are to die for. My favorite was the Carnitas but everything was good.
4,"We are Johnny Cash fans and we still learned a lot. There was lots of music to listen to, videos to watch and some fascinating objects from his life."
2,"Rude elderly lady at the drive thru. Don't change your drink to iced as it's a hassle and worth an eye roll. She literally yelled ""she wants it iced now"" and tells me it's gonna be a couple minutes. A couple minutes to pour my coffee over ice and and put a lid on it. Got it. Next time go to Starbucks that's on the same lot and comes without attitude. Coffee was good."
4,"Great hotel!  Would definitely stay there again.  Adam, the car valet, was a great.  Had excellent food and entertainment recommendations!"
3,"This place was really cool. There was a gentleman at the door ready to get us seated. He's sort of a seating expediter due to the tight quarters.

That being said we had some really good BBQ and the sauces were very flavorful.  Definitely stop in when you go to St. Louis."
4,"Beautiful restaurant and view of the beach and gulf. We all enjoyed our meals. Service was friendly, welcoming and prompt. Will definitely return."
4,"We went there on a Friday afternoon for lunch. Ordered 2 doz lightly steamed oysters on the half shell, a doz med size blue crabs, a shrimp scampi dinner, one bottled water, and two long necks, all for $55. We had ""Sam"" for a waiter, and she was THE greatest!! FYI, if you plan to go there for fresh, steamed crab, plan on bringing your own mallets (theirs are a little limp), and YouTube how to get meat out of Blue Crab."
4,"I don't know whats better, the exposed brick and open air feel, or the latte and cappuccinos. Definitely one of my favorite coffee shops in the city. Check it out if your visiting the old city district"
1,Your standard chain destination. I remember going out to iron hill was an amazing experience where the food was fresh and exciting but everything we had just tasted so bland. We found a piece of plastic in our fish tacos that took my whole table by shock. The manager came and comped it for us but it wasn't enough to justify the plastic I was pulling from my teeth later that evening. With all the other amazing restaurants on the strip I Can't see myself coming back here at all.
3,"Modern yet sophisticated ambiance paired with a bustling crowd. This seems to be the place everyone is talking about right now! Our service was phenomenal (I can't remember her name, unfortunately). We had stone crab claws, shrimp, Sea Bass, NY Strip and a Nutella filled cookie with malted milk. I did feel as though it was a bit pricey. Otherwise, it was a very enjoyable evening with friends."
4,I get all my cars serviced here.  Been getting my tires here for as long as I can remember.  I'm always treated fair and the crew here is awesome.  I HIGHLY recommend coming here for tires and more.
3,"Traveling from Boston to California our first stop due to daughter being very sick they allowed us to check in early. Truly appreciated their kindness and compassion. The continental breakfast was perfect. Great staff, clean and very accommodating."
2,"This is definitely a DogTown - neighborhood - kind of place. The food portions are HUGE. The burgers go off the edges of the bun. However, though quite yummy, they are also quite greasy. The drinks weren't that strong... and service was just ok.

It's good, but not great."
4,"Nice people, nice store.  Excellent service and I bought several items that were delicious including the Amish Swiss Cheese, and German Bologna.

The store is clean and the attendants we encountered both times we were there were excellent.  The prices were far below super market prices!!!

Another item we wanted was on order for delivery soon.  We will return again!!  Great store!!"
4,"Not bad just your typical D&B huge collection of games and food great for kids and family! 
The only thing pricy is the games but kinda worth it if you wanna have fun."
4,Awesome place! Great modern funky artsy feel! Delicious food. Yummy coffee and super awesome staff. I discovered this place one day and it was soooo good I came back the very next. New favorite spot for sure. I'd give it 10 stars if I could!
4,amazing good food highly recommend. best food i can get gurrentee. please come eat here it's oooo good
4,"Always great service. I just came back from the store. I had an issue with my gearshift. 
Instead of waiting in line and get charged for a complete check, the staff helped me with their knowledge. 
It was not a big deal but I appreciate it so much. Thanks for the great customer service and I will definitely come back for my new bike in few months."
4,"Mariah, was such a great game master. She was helpful with hints and guided us through Family secrets very well. Definitely recommend her as a game master."
0,"Currently closed. Will reopen under new management and new name, Cabo's Mexican Grill."
0,Is not open 24/7 as advertised. Yelp says 24/7 it's open 24/7. Door says it's open 24/7. Forget this place. Didn't want their nasty food anyway.
4,"Got to this place after we blew out a tire and needed a place to eat, the service and food here is top notch and you can see your pizza being made right through the glass!"
4,I love the food at subway you can choose any food you want on almost any type of bread.the food taste great  they also have pizza and salad the people who work there are very nice especially the owner and the place is clean I would recommend this place to people who want to get quick food and This is the best subway out of the one I've been
4,"Beth was fantastic! She took the time to help us decide what beer suited our needs. She recommended a Belgian Dark Strong that was fantastic and paired extremely well with our dessert and tasted fantastic! 

We loved it so much we also took home Belgian Wit that I can't wait to open! 

You must stop by for a fantastic taste of their amazing beers for your long walk up or down State Street! 

Cheers!

Thanks Beth!"
4,"First time here! Working in a similar restaurant back home. I can say the steak and chicken fajitas were very tasty. Beans were ok, but the rice was a bit on the dry side. Good service very attentive! Came in on lunch time, tried out the $1.99 margaritas and had to get a second margarita because they were very good and potent! Highly recommend the margaritas. Will be coming back if I have a chance..."
2,"Cute store and I bought quite a few bags to gift and eat myself when we were visiting from Washington. I am kind of a popcorn snob and although the flavors sounds amazing, the two bags I have opened thus far have been kind of stale and a little underwhelming."
4,"I am not a bbq aficionado, but we did really enjoy Beast bbq.  10 of us got 2 good meals out of what we ordered (3 racks of ribs, 3 orders of wings, 2 pounds of turkey, half pan of brussels, potato salad, coleslaw, 6 sides of mac, etc.)  The leftovers reheated in the oven were great too! Omar is great. Thanks Beast."
4,Best South Pacific food we've ever had. Our fav use to be L&L in Cali. But this place is better by far. Kalbi ribs are tender and the Mac salad has great flavor. Nice find for the Tampa area.
3,"Stopped here on Friday, 1:30 am on my way back from Delaware.  Pleasantly surprised!  From the awesome server to the great food.  Usually when you grab something to eat in the middle of the night it is usually subpar.  Not this time!!!  Would definitely come back when in the area!!  Thank you."
2,"I have to admit after all of the rave reviews I was a bit let down.  Got the beet salad, bone marrow, charcuterie plate, grilled octopus, and meatballs...all which should have sung with diverse flavors...everything was a bit bland and meh."
4,"They recently added a truly dairy free milk: extra creamy oat milk. We came over the soonest we could to try it out. The oat milk is excellent with the boba tea and we will definitely keep coming back!!! Yay!!!
If I could give more than five stars, I would!"
3,"Great vegan and healthy options. They even have coconut cream for your coffee, but you should know the coconut cream is vanilla flavored, so no sweetener needed. Yum!"
4,"Excellent service and hospitality, of course with great meals and deserts. Nutella donuts were dangerously good."
1,"Poor service, slow service. Bar out of a standard easy drink.  7:00 pm.  No water or greeting for 15 minutes. Entree not available either. Food was just okay. Very expensive for just ok food."
2,"Takeout generally takes pretty long but decent burgers. I would recommend trying if your in the area, yet would not recommend trying of you are driving far away. There are many other burger options"
4,Chase was an outstanding writer. Food was great. Shrimp Diablo. Even had dessert. Quiet and classy.
3,"Came with my parents after hearing good things, and ordered a bunch! My favorite things were the spicy numbing dry pot, along with the sticky rice filled lotus. We also ordered a red chili oil conch appetizer, and a fish. My parents swore they gave us a tilapia instead of the bass, but I have no idea! The food was all spicy and flavorful, and the dish decor was very fancy."
2,"Unfortunately, I guess I was too hyped, or I caught them during a busy lunch time... I got the Dry Rub ribs, they were ok, actually on the dry side, so I did do a lot more sauce dipping then I anticipated. The mac & cheese and green beans were great sides that made up for the disappointment of the ribs.  Seems like a phone place to come after work and grab some beer and BBQ at... I'll see if I can make that happen during my meeting next year."
4,"Best quality is a great take out pizza place. I've tried their pizza, steaks, gyros, fries, chicken fingers. All of which are standard pizza takeout restaurant selections and they're all great."
4,Outstanding deal on some great pizza!! Went during Happy Hour to maximize this deal!! 2 pizzas 1 salad 2 drinks and a Half Pitcher of beer. Out of pocket with this deal was $21!!!
1,"This should be a stellar park but it is a mess. Can't blame the pooches but you can their owners. For whatever reason, the people that live in this area and frequent this park seem to feel it is below them (no pun intended) to pick up their dogs' messes. It is the dirtiest of  Nashville's dog parks. We have visited dog parks from Texas to Georgia and this one is strewn with feces land mines. 

We will start heading to other dog parks even though we are just a half mile from here."
3,Pretty good meal. Nothing spectacular but nothing bad either.
3,"It is a paradise of pizza-lovers. There is so many kinds of Pizza which you can barely find in most pizza store. I ordered lamb pizza, it is cooked on fire, I guess, the thin crispy bread is so yummy"
4,"The food was soooo good. Fun, lively atmosphere and great customer service. Will definitely go back!"
3,I would have to give tacconelli's pizza 4 stars The pizza is great their business hours are very weird you need to call like 4 hours or the day before to reserve a doe because they run out of pizza really fast but it is a thin slice pizza that is incredible
4,Literally the best post office I've ever been to. I was in and out and the service was warm.
4,"Judy is incredible! I have been purchasing her artwork for years, and am so pleased to see her business expanding! She is knowledgeable and truly loves what she does - which reflects in the beautiful pieces she creates. 

I am looking forward to visiting Fused Finery in the near future and can't wait for the classes!"
0,"One star only because zero isn't possible. I called this morning and received the same rude attitude that the other reviewer referenced. After I inquired about product availability, the jackass responded with ""you expect me to tell you how much a 2x4 will cost?"", then hung up on me. You couldn't pay me to give this place my business!!!"
3,Stopped by here after dinner for some gelato. My toddler loved it!  It's a cute place where it looks like it'd be nice to curl up with a good book or study.  I'd come back to try some other flavors and get some drinks next time.
4,"Pretty much like every other Apple Store I've been to - bright, clean, busy, fully stocked, with pleasant, helpful employees who always manage to solve my computing problems and answer my questions about new products."
0,"Most Kroger grocery stores aren't up to par in the 21st century, but this Kroger in Madison is especially awful.  Everytime I pull into the parking lot it feels like I'm about to be crashed into.  Think flickering fluorescent lights, dirty tile floors, odd store layout, and weird smells.  You go in there looking for inspiration for your next meal, but you end up feeling like you are in a ""Saw"" film. I hope it gets bulldozed down and replaced with a Trader Joes."
4,"Nice atmosphere and the food was delicious !  I had the seafood chowder and the Seafood Chop Salad which was amazing. Hubby had one of the specials: Sunset Trio which had hogfish, shrimp, and I believe Mahi Mahi all prepared fabulously and reasonably priced"
4,"came here for lunch with a friend. when we got here we thought the place was closed, at least thats what the time on the door said. We were heading back to the car when the owner came out and called us back in. Had lamb kabobs, it was sooooooo gooooood!! the rice and potato was awesome! the owner was serving us. he was so nice! it was a little pricey but we didnt mind paying because of the awesome service and great taste!"
2,Yep the maple bacon  doughnut is grrrrrreat. First maple bacon doughnut  i have ever had. All the other doughnuts had from them were good. More of a heavy doughnut not my favorite and a bit pricey if you ask me for a doughnut. But your talking a couple dollars difference for 2 dozen. The slection was kinda small the two times i have been their. Maybe they just run out fast. The doughnuts just seamed average. I would give them 3.5 stars just can't give them 4 stars.
0,Trash Tech never picked up my trash this week even after 4 phone calls.I was assured they were calling dispatch but when a truck did show they still didn't take my trash. Also they are now doing recycling every other week and sent out the wrong scheduled so I now have 3 weeks worth of recycling. Changing my service on Monday.
3,Delicious! I love the Erics Breakfast Burrito I get it everytime and the vibe in there is so calm and they allow dogs on the patio which makes me love them more! A very fun and relaxing place for breakfast that is delicious
3,"Great restaurant with nice atmosphere, especially in courtyard area. Has the best margaritas!"
1,"food was the standard Fazoli's food, the dinning area was dirty and the restroom was gross. The place was crazy busy, and the management was not allowing people to find a table until they had ordered food."
4,"This place has the freshest meats I ever tasted.  We love their sandwiches and onion rings.  The owner comes off a little abrupt but he is a man who knows his sandwiches.  He was a little much when I placed the order but then when I went in he was sweet as pie. I think he was stressed because how busy they are. So bottoms line, well worth it. Sandwiches are great.  

Oh and it's cash only, they have an ATM in store but charges $2 fee."
4,"I often stared across the side street from beloved Cashew Cow at Sidecar wondering what mysteries are inside. Finally, C and I decided to check it out. Joined by another friend, we met Nicky, The bartender. Something about a pony tail and an creative flair for making drinks made him the staple of the night. We tried 5 mixed drinks between the three of us. Everything from the Shandy to the Dark and Stormy, these classic drinks were explored in a very new way.
We ambiance was cool and the interior was great! Nicky made the night though. We will definitely be back!"
4,"I moved here 3 years ago but just know about this place, the best hot pastrami i ever had, will try other one."
4,It was a quick and easy sign up and we had a really good time throwing axes. The owner was really nice and helpful! Definitely come here for a good time!
4,"Awesome choices. Friendly staff. Outdoor seating. Outdoor heaters (when needed: no indoors seating); free coffee refills; delicious Americano. Dog friendly, if you've trained it to behave in public. Kid friendly."
1,"For this day anyway...the pit bosses were absolutely unfriendly and so were the dealers.  Not sure why anyone would come back again!

Beer was also a rip off!  No happy hour!"
0,"The associates are so rude and help walk-ins over appointment customers, even in the middle of an appointment checkout. They can't even find contacts that are ready and don't believe you that you received a call saying they were ready until you almost have to prove it with the voicemail they left. And the solution to a cyst on my eyelid that the doctor found was to sleep in my contacts if they don't bother me and he wasn't even going to look at it until I asked him again about it. It's a little sad."
4,"Decided to try this place out this past summer for a girls night. The place was packed so we were seated outside (awesome!) really enjoyed the food and drinks, service was great as well. Will definitely be back!"
4,"YELPERS, DO NOT OVERTHINK THIS!

The food is fantastic, spice levels are appropriate (my wife ordered it mild while I ordered my food spicy), and the owners are fantastic people!  Come out and support this gem, the place was nearly empty when we ate there.  I do not get to this area often; however, I do not want to see it closed the next time I go due to a lack of business!  Five stars, all the way!"
3,Been twice; the food has been very good and the oysters very fresh and tasty. Service has been good both times. Liquor license soon to come but the wine and beer selection has been good. Ambience is nice.
1,"Good, cheap banh mi, nasty, NASTY service. The older woman behind the counter made a store full of people wait while she ranted at the staff for 15 minutes. It made me so uncomfortable I left my purchases unpaid for on the counter."
4,Great coffee and breakfast sandwich was very delicious. Awesome neighborhood coffee spot atmosphere close to the river.
4,"Had a chance to try both cafe beignet and cafe Du Monde. Maybe it was going to Du Monde on Easter Sunday... day after we went back to cafe Beignet and the coffee is about a million times better and their Beignets are softer, fluffier and have better flavor. 
The staff at cafe Beignet have been polite and professional both mornings weve come here. They're quick, and the coffee tastes fuller with more flavor.
And while I bake at home, my daughter enjoyed the chocolate eclaire too"
3,"We visited New Orleans specifically to see a specific band who was playing at the Republic.  As Nashvillians, we know about tight venues so we weren't too surprised.  Overall, the place has a neat vibe, but come prepared.  Wear layers because it's going to get hot.  In our case, it was a pretty chilly night, but I was able to strip down to a tank top - thank goodness.  Also, grab a water or two because you're not gonna want to move and lose your spot once the show gets started.  Get there early if you want a great view too."
4,"The Bangkok City is one of the best Thai restaurants in this area. The food was very well prepared and tasted well. The orders have big portion. The place is not big or fancy, but very clean. The waitresses are friendly. I will definitely come back again."
3,"1st time here. Pretty good. Big portions. Nice clean place. I'd say home fries need alittle more flavor and cooking. Pancakes are delicious. I would recommend coming here vs. a lot if other diners in Philly . Location is also great. After your done eating you can take a walk around fish town, take advantage of a few places they have around here."
4,"We were craving panini's big time and found this place via Yelp.  The food is true to a European cafe. Love it! The Lombardy panini was crisp and delicious. 

We shared a dessert creap of bananas with nutella.
Perfect for a Saturday lunch! 

Will definitely be back! The coffee price are way better than a Starbucks, the pastries are fresh made, and it's a comfortable hang out spot."
3,The setting is nice. My friend and I share the steak platter is was tasty. Our dessert was just so-so we have chocolate dome with hot Sauce poured on top it end up being looking like a soupy mess and was hard to eat. I love my desserts.
1,"I was really disappointed in my experience. The drinks were great, but the food was mediocre, and the service was awful. We never received our appetizers, and we barely saw our waiter. I'd go back for just the cocktails."
4,Excellent service. Speedy repairs. Knowledgeable service technicians. Very reasonable pricing.
2,"I really want to love this place but I just can't. The location is superb, great atmosphere with outdoor seating, cheap happy hour specials. But the food is reheated chain food. If the food was higher quality this place would be five stars!"
4,"Cafe Bardot's decor whisks you to another time and place.  The food is eclectic and exceptionally well prepared.  My husband and I shared the rabbit crepe, the falafel, and the burger.  The burger was one of the best I've ever had.  We ended with a deconstructed cocoa banana bread - unique and delicious.  We will definitely come again."
4,"Trying this bakery today was a TREAT! We got an assortment to take home, including a chocolate ginger cookie, a double chocolate cookie, a chocolate chip cookie, and a pumpkin bar. The cookies were thick, fluffy, and so delicious. We all thought the chocolate ginger cookie tasted exactly like a soft ginger snap (a compliment)! Southern Bay Bakery was also decorated nicely with a clean and light atmosphere. Great experience, thanks!"
3,"Well it's been a while since I've been able to get out so I'm just really glad about that. I was with a friend at Drexel and we came here for a smoothie. It was good. I wish I had known about the app, it would have been free!"
4,"Best mall in Philadelphia area. I'm not sure if it's the best in East coast but yeah, definitely the best in Philadelphia. I went here a lot. Roaming Borders most of the time. Sad now that Borders gone :(

Their renew food court is awesome! Super cool. Love it. Love the fake fireplace and the TV :D

Mom always frequent this Macy's too. She said that KOP got the BEST Macy's among Philly, Jersey and Delaware area.

But yeah.. KOP needs to come up with new bookstore.. please :)"
0,I saw a truck being towed in front of 1817 Fairmount Ave. I took a picture of the space so whoever was towed reach out to me to fight this kidnapping your truck!
4,"Adorably cute, friendly staff, great coffee, cozy little chairs to read in.  Yes please, count me in.

I had been in town for a conference & was excited to spend some quite time before I headed to the airport later in the day.  I really can't recommend this place any more, as it was exactly what I look for in a coffee shop."
0,"This has got to be the worst Whole Foods in the country. Yesterday was the last straw, was treated very rudely by staff at the deli counter. I dealt with the dirtiness and lack of certain items because its a little closer than having to drive up oracle but never coming to this location again. Management needs a serious makeover."
4,"I just ate an excellent meal!  I got their Saturday evening special of $11.99 for any of their steaks with two sides.  So I ordered a 10 oz. New York strip steak with Traders Winds chips and a baked potato.  

It was not too busy with lots of TVs."
4,"With COVID and being at home all the time, I didn't expect much for my birthday. My friend surprised me with brunch at Tupelo Honey and this has truly been the highlight of my month. This place is super covid friendly as there's adequate space between you and other guests. The servers wear masks and make you feel so comfortable. Special shoutout to our server, Caleb, who was super sweet and made me feel special on my day. I will definitely be making another brunch trip shortly. Highly recommended every single meal in this picture."
4,"Joel was awesome! Great attitude, great service, and a great atmosphere. We will be back to see Joel!"
4,"First time at Taco Chela and it didn't disappoint! The margaritas are so fresh and delicious. Even the mexican mule was amazing. I highly recommend the bang bang shrimp tacos and the pork belly tacos. Hopefully you will meet Fernando, that guy is great!"
4,OMG!!!  This place is awesome!  Definitely sit outside if available because the view of the mountains is gorgeous.  The house guacamole is a must as is the braised short rib and avocado crisp.  Absolute heaven.  Being from the San Francisco area we are no way strangers to the greatness of the street taco and I must tell you that the carnitas taco puts those to shame!!!  Best ever and now I want a Blanco in California!!!   We will absolutely be back.
4,"This place is fantastic!!  Fresh seafood, deliciously prepared. Small inside but the food is worth every penny. Love the grouper sandwich (fried). The onion rings can't be beat. Even their fries are delicious-sprinkled with Parmesan cheese and garlic. Go early...once the fresh seafood is sold, they close up for the evening."
4,"We absolutely loved this restaurant! It's super busy on the weekends, but if you catch an early brunch or lunch during the week, it's perfect. It's definitely a place we will continue to visit throughout our lives."
2,"Once again I'm giving this place 3 stars.  The atmosphere leaves much to be desired, open kitchen, dining area needs a good cleaning and remodel and the outside dining is right there on a busy Pima Street.  The food is good though and service is OK.  Nice help yourself bean crock pot sits out with numerous sauces many made with fresh herbs. Close to traditional home style Hispanic food I've had in a while.  I will return and enjoyed my meal above all else."
0,"I cant speak about the food because I didn't stay long enough to find out. Why a restaurant would put the health of their patrons at risk is beyond comprehension.  I was trying to enjoy an evening sunset on the deck at a eating table (which is the only tables they have) with my grandson and daughter and they preferred to allow someone to smoke cigarettes on their deck, instead of asking the smokers to step 10 or 15 feet out of the deck they chose to allow us to close our check, cancel our order and leave. If this is how they run their business I definitely will not be back."
2,"Super packed, seemed unorganized, wait time was forever. But. The food was normal. Prices seem to keep rising as well."
3,"I ordered a salad from Torch-Wood Market for delivery and was very happy with my order! The salad was super fresh and had a nice amount of toppings. The dressing was served on the side, per my request. Best of all, I think the salad set me back something like eight bucks. I never get away with spending less than ten bucks for lunch so that was a true joy. Looking forward to many more happy memories with Torch-Wood!"
4,"I have always been a thin crust pizza guy and was hesitant to try this place. When they moved into their new location in Passyunk ave ( the former Cochon restaurant) I decided to give it a shot. WOW! Amazing Pizza!  I had the small Melanzane with tomato sauce, ricotta, olives roasted eggplant and it going to be on my list of GO-TO pizza places, Next time I am going to try the interesting selection of salads and antipasta. Nice cozy atmosphere and good service."
0,"My friend's 4 year old was mauled by a dog BAHS found suitable for adoption at an adoption event this weekend. The dog's handler told me minutes before that he had been training the dog for two months, and it was good with kids. Skin punctured in multiple places. Teeth on head. Scary as Hell and lucky it wasn't a lot worse. Found out today that the dog was not up to date on rabies vaccinations. These people don't know what they're doing, and it's dangerous."
3,"Danielle did a great job finding this location. The store is small but it feels more like a museum than a tourist trap. A lot of items from the show. My only complaint would be the size. I only hoped for something larger to explore. If you're a fan of the show and are in town, give it a look."
0,"I will not ever, ever eat here again. This was one of my favorite places to eat for year's. (NEVER AGAIN"").
We were seated with menu an silverware. 10 minutes later I had to call someone over just to get water. An hour later before I got home I got terribly ill. THE FOOD TASTED GOOD BUT MY STOMACH AN BODY DID NOT LIKE IT."
4,Triple chocolate chunk.....best freakin cookie I have ever had......
1,"Very disappointing!  I ordered Mongolian beef as a lunch special.  The flavor was good but I had a very small amount of beef and what was actually in the dis was very small tidbits.  The fried rice and egg roll were good but overall disappointing.  The brown in the picture are mushrooms not beef.

Not sure if I'll try again"
1,"I usually love going to these stores that's why i'm a member 
But this location is really rude 
My niece and I walk in no one says hello even though they are standing around talking to each other 
 the free coffee at the front is empty so I mention it to a passing worker who ROLLS HER EYES and keeps walking 
We walk through the store and no one is talking to any customer 
I know they are working but you can't even say can I help you while you are passing them in the aisle?
There were over 10 people working and not one person cared about the customers"
0,Had my car damaged in $5 wash. Be careful and check your vehicle from top to bottom. Manager showed me photos from his phone  that the kid took of the damaged area and stated that they were on there and the that the pictures were taken before I went into the wash. These were not there before. Black tar marks and scuff marks on on side and scratches on top roof. Got it repaired and cleaned at a body shop the next day. Please beware.
4,Had the most delicious sausage gravy over an oversized bisquit. Even with it being so busy the service was excellent and the waitress was very attentive.  Will definitely be returning.
4,Everything about my visit was great and most importantly relaxing.  Spa itself was very nice from the luxurious towels to the comfortable furniture.  I received a body massage that was exactly what I needed for soar muscles and a time to relax for a moment in my busy life.  My massage therapist was Eugenie.  She was great.  I definitely recommend her service.  She was very informative about the service along with very personable and a great massage therapist.  I will ask for her again next time I visit and you should too.
3,"I would have gave them a 5 cause the burrito was amazing but the service wasn't the best they weren't very attentive to me, either way living in Oregon and coming to California this burrito feels like home."
4,"This is by far one of our favourite restaurants for a breakfast or brunch.  The variety is great, the food is delectable, and the staff are always very helpful and friendly.  One of us often orders the combination with sausage, ham, bacon, eggs and their wonderful potato pancakes.  The other goes for the smaller seniors portion with bacon, egg and potato pancakes.  We always look forward to our next visit."
4,"This place was great. My husband and I were in town for a wedding and stayed a few extra days, on our last night we discovered this place and decided to give it a try. The place was clean, trendy, staff were very pleasant and the food was wonderful. Not only was the food delicious but the portions were huge! We loved the whole experience and if we ever stop back around that area we plan on making that our first place to eat!"
3,"Yum! We started with the samosas and they were good, a little salty. We then had some entrees and naan. They were yummy. I took off a star because of the service. I agree with other reviewers that it isn't the best. It seemed like in the middle of our meal their waitstaff left so getting the check and getting a to go box took a while."
4,"Absolutely the best gumbo on earth.  Shrimp po boy beats Jhonnie's in The Quarter hands down.  Full bar, good people."
3,"Friends asked us to go when they reopened to show their support. We had never been before. But we will be back. The food was wonderful, a little pricy (maybe in this aspect not the best for kids unless they can eat it all), but so full of flavor and unique combinations of food. I appreciate how the management handled their issue, and probably the only reason why i was willing try it. Glad to see so many people shoed up to support the business!"
3,We love to have lunch here.  Our favorite is the Yoga Instructor sandwich.
3,"The coffee is good. The fancy coffee drinks are good. The crepes are outstanding! The other pastries they get from a local bakery are great, too. I have not yet tried the waffles, which they only serve on weekends. Prices are reasonable. Service is excellent, although expect a long wait for crepes at lunch time. Sometimes seating is a little hard to come by, despite a recent expansion of their seating. Overall, it has a rather hipster feel.

On the whole, a reasonably priced, fun little hangout for coffee and niche eats."
3,"I braved the rush hour and edged past cars bound for the backed-up turnpike who thought I was trying to cut in line...take a deep breath, angry drivers, I was just trying to get to happy hour! 

The Deviled Eggs were incredible...I probably ate close to half a  dozen eggs. The Tavern Wings were also very delicious (opt for a sampler to try the different flavors), and the Spiked Calamari and Meat and Cheese Board were also good options."
4,The red velvet pancakes are a must! Be aware that there is usually a long wait for breakfast - but it is worth it!
4,Excellent pizza and beer! I had a sampler all the beers and they were each delicious. Love this place and wish I lived nearer so I could become a regular!
1,I wanted to give 4 stars for the ambiance and service but for the food 2 stars are more than enough. I got badly smelled beans and undercooked rice. I have to think to visit again.
0,"They just play games.  I had a price finalized that they backed out on the day I was going in to complete the sale.  Precision gave the price and was great to work with.  At Desert, it is all BS and they do not know the first thing about sales or customer service.

I did call Kendra to tell her about my experience and I received no follow up as promised."
4,"Didn't expect it but, Enjay's Pizza was truly exceptional. Friendly atmosphere, great service and delicious menu items. Every single thing that I have actually tried has been rather delicious. The crew was really friendly and service is awesome. Enjay's Pizza - It is a unique and wonderful experience."
2,Gyro Stop.  Ah...I had a coupon.  The gyro was ok.  I have definitely had much better.  The falafel though was fantastic.  I would go back to try such fare as their dolmades and shawarma.  Good place for some quick food in a hurry.  Nice owner for sure.
4,"This place is hands down the best hat store and maybe retail experience I've had. I went to buy a particular hat for my boyfriend.  He had one from here that he lost. As I walked in, I'm immediately greeted. The sales person never left my side,  even though he had lots of inventory to unpack and I was searching through my phone for a photo to show him! He was patient, new the hat immediately.  Helped me guess the correct size and gave me a gift box. It took 10 minutes or less. Great job Meyer the hatter!"
4,I am thanking Donald and Eric for taking care of my tree and doing exactly as I asked!! Tree looks great I will be back in spring!! Chase thank you for correcting the issue!
3,"This is our favorite go to chinese restaurant in the area.  They deliver to us now which just makes it even better!  :-)  Good food, quick service, and delivery!  Excellent."
4,"This is my favorite Italian restaurant! I don't know what magic the do back in the kitchen but the cream sauce is to die for! Prices are pretty fair, so you don't have to spend a fortune! Family friendly and the staff if very polite and attentive! They won't disappoint!"
4,This place has great lunch sandwiches and some delicious pork shoulder(pernil). If you like Latin food this place is a must visit
3,"Good, honest breakfast food and great service. Not dazzling but a solid, reasonable place to eat."
4,"We have been going to this Outback for years! Love the employees who always have a smile on their faces and are very helpful. My wife and I love the food. I'm a big cheese fries guy and my wife loves their Mac n cheese. Great steaks, seafood, and chicken and the service is always good. Enjoy!"
4,I read the Yelp review while visiting my family and had to try to help take off the edge of a family visit.  I was incredibly pleased with the welcoming service and fabulous libations!  Nicely priced as well.
3,"I went on a Monday and ordered the Carnitas Tacos (the special that day) with a can of beer for only $10. The food is great and reasonably priced. The only downside was the service. The restaurant wasn't very crowded yet server was very slow to come over and introduce himself, slow to return with the drinks, and slow to take our orders. This is not a place to grab a ""quick"" bite."
2,"We have been trying several BBQ places around Tucson and decided to try here. We were not impressed. It was ok, but it was dry and really did not have a ""smoked"" flavor. We probably will never come back here."
1,I felt like I was on a conveyor belt. The nail tech was extremely rough.  The skin around my toes were raw. My manicure was so rushed that the gel is bubbly and stuck to my skin. The ends of my nail are jagged.  While getting my manicure the nail tech kept hitting my toes with her feet that I just had a pedicure done. Would not recommend
4,"I loved these place. I have this friend that grew up here and he told me what to order. It was typical Cajun food. I had boudin , crawfish pie and even alligator. It was delicious. Cochon dish was spectacular!! Is a must!! Don't forget to order the upside down  pineapple cake."
4,"Wow!  Valentine's Day, no reservation and got a delicious steak and shrimp dinner.  They have stepped up the menu from the past.   Anything with BBQ is awesome!  Great bar fare and Fridays live music!"
4,"Best pizza place in the area, meatballs and meatball pizza are wildly good, antipasto salad is great. We go here often, it's often crowded at peak hours but the tables turn over pretty fast."
3,Always walked by this place until one day finally needed a coffee buzz and it happened to be nearby. Really good coffee with reasonable prices. I like sitting down to enjoy my coffee and this place has a ton of room. The employees are very friendly too!
4,The best pizza in northern Nevada! Will return over and over and happily make a 30 minute drive to do so. The owners are warm and inviting & the company's mission is true to heart! So happy to have found this place!
0,"I don't know how ppl can take this hospital! Clearly they are too busy to see you pet. You have to schedule you appointment at least a month advance. However, If you did that, there is also a possibility that you won't see the doctor. I understand you only have one doctor. But if you have something happen to your pets they will always asked do you want to treat it as a emergency?! Okay, everyone knows the emergence fees is higher than the regular visit. Also, why you only have time for emergency?"
3,"I came here with a large group for a friend's birthday and was not disappointed with any of the food or the drinks. I ordered the 4 crunchy pork tacos (they were featured menu items) and wish there was more as they were TINY. Food for ants. Loud and fun atmosphere, good but tiny portioned food."
3,"this is the best tasting place out of all the burrito joints. my husband is a huge burrito fan and we've been to qdoba, baja fresh, el fuego and panchero. it's not overly salty and the burritos are huge. it has the same M.O. as the other places but for some reason it just tastes the freshest."
1,"Wiseguys is the correct name...the staff was rude and short tempered with customers. Pizza had good flavor, but was cold and over cooked. Find a better option."
4,"Everything is fantastic- had take out several times during Covid and enjoyed everything that we tried 
Finally able to eat in the restaurant and WOW-  surprise- there were great $5 specials on Sunday!...we tried a fantastic crispy pizza and the wine special plus our incredible meal... the halloumi was fantastic!!
They even have a $6 happy hour menu we can't wait to try!"
0,"I went in Sunday 03/05/2017 witnessed the employees arguing and being very rude and disrespectful to each other at one point One employee stated ""I know what the F*CK I am doing"" this is unacceptable I WILL NOT BE BACK I WONT go to any other Dunkin Donuts that are affiliated with this location Spoke with Area manger and was not confident that it will be handled correctly. I did speak to store manager and she did apologize to me However I will NOT continue to give my business to them if they continue to allow their employees to work in a hostile work environment"
4,"Our heat went out and Seliga was quick, efficient, friendly and informative. They were at my house within hours even though I was a brand new client and it was their busy season. The technician that arrived (Wayne G.) was a pleasure to work with, and he answered all of my questions with obvious expertise. I'm very glad I reached out to them, and while I hope I don't have to call them too often, I'm happy to know that I've found a reliable and trustworthy HVAC service in my area."
0,"I like the ambiance but the coffee is not my favorite, the service is very okay. For the high price, it would be nice if they put the milk or sugar in, or at least offered to. I am pretty disappointed in this place. I came once on my way to work- this place doesn't open til 7am and I got there at 6:52am, they made me wait outside for 8 minutes rather than opening a minute or two early, which I felt was pretty rude. I prefer Starbucks or Columbo."
4,"U-Pack is amazing. Everyone was extremely helpful and willing to go the extra mile to make sure my stuff was safe. Great alternative to the more expensive services. 
I also hear ABF has great LTL service!"
4,"Only a 10 min drive from the Airport; this place was a great stop for breakfast. Authentic Mexican food

The food didn't take too long to get ready, healthy portions and cooked right in front of you.

The only con is there aren't a lot of parking spots, so it could potentially get packed."
2,"I ordered carry out. Boneless wings were missing even after they apparently checked the order. The manager did make it right and remade the wings, but definitely not the first time my order was incorrect. & the wings seem to be dry always have to ask for extra sauce"
4,"When my heater stopped working during the winter, Brad recommended a simpler, less expensive one that he said would have fewer problems. It was installed quickly and is working fine. Then when my thermostat went out, I thought I'd have to get a new one. He figured out what was wrong with it and fixed it in a few minutes. I'll call Brad if I need anything heater-related in the future because he is efficient and good at what he does and his goal is to do the right thing for the customer. I trust him."
2,The food and beer were just a tad better than average--i did not care for the atmosphere....we sat at a table behind the bar and it was open and close to the busy path that all th servers go back and forth....I guess for a brew pub I would like a more intimate and cozy experience while enjoying a burger and beer...It was on the loud side too...
4,Great place to come to after a night out in downtown Nashville. Enjoyed the breakfast bagel and green smoothie. The Breakfast Bagel was nicely toasted and the cheese melted. The green smoothie drink was also very refreshing and not too sweet. What I like most about this place is its location next to the community center and Park. Good place to come grab your order and take it to the park to enjoy especially during covid-19. Just a tip I would recommend ordering ahead of time using Uber Eats app it will save you time waiting in line.
0,Shitty gym ever!! Rude  customer service. Dirty !! Leaving joining a new gym cleaner nicer and child friendly!!
4,"I'm so happy this beautiful salon is in Santa Barbara! The manicures and pedicures are excellent. The staff is wonderful and welcoming. The owner, Claudia is always helpful and gracious. I highly recommend Aqua and am always pleased with the results!"
3,"This place has definitely improved over the years. Service can be a bit spotty. The food is great but a bit overpriced, but the quality of the sushi is really worth it. They also have great cocktails. Their tonkatsu ramen is really great too!"
3,Want a place to go with friends and be able to talk. Here's your place. No tv or blaring music.   Some unique drinks
3,"So I've been to a few brunches with the Fairmont chain and this one was on par with the others, which is fanatasic!
I decided to do something different for my birthday this year (I am a lady now:)) so I gathered  a few friends and made it a fancy brunch birthday.
It was nice to see everyone dressed up at noon on a Sunday and the food was very delicious.
I wish it was summer time in Edm. because it would have been nice to sit out in the garden, but it was still a nice time...highly recommend:)"
1,The food was delicious and the service and ambiance were fantastic. Biggest problem was that the $42.00 Entrée of braised brisket came on a small appetizer sized plate and I walked away hungry after a $50 something dollar meal.... Skimping on food is a big no no. Especially at that price point
4,"Friendly and fast! Dropped off my iPhone to have the screen repaired and to have a glass protector screen I had already purchased installed. Went to Stone-Age for about 25 minutes, and shopped for a birthday gift for my daughter. By the time I was finished shopping, my phone was ready! Thanks for your friendliness and quick work!"
0,Went in there looking for a kids puddle jumper asked the guy behind the counter if he had any his response NO but in a rude way asked if he knew if any other places hade any and was rude again. It's not what you say but how you say it. Didn't even say hey we don't have them but we have these and they work the same way so I took my business elsewhere. If you don't like your job find a new one that simple.
4,"Had lunch here three years ago.  Sat inside which was very nice, considering the humid heat and I'm from the northwest.  

Had the crab cakes....loved them.  I'm back this week and they are at the top of my list for dinner...have to try the linginni with craw fish."
4,"I have been going here for a couple of years now, and yesterday I got the ""fancy nails pedicure"" (upgraded pedicure, $10 more). It was awesome! It was over an hour long and included a leg exfoliant, leg mask, and a hot stone massage. The massage it's self was at least 20 minutes. Well worth the money. Highly recommend this place to anyone looking for the best bang for your buck pedicure!"
4,"Well.....This is NOT taco bell!!! Hats off the the ciccio restaurant group for this super trendy, some taco concept. This is the 2nd trip and every item I tasted was delicious. The options for gluten/vegan free are endless. The avocado noodles are a must as well as the fried broccoli."
4,Great Japanese steak house.  Great service.
2,"Great place for cheap lunch. It's enough to fill your stomach with food. You get soup, choice of Chicken, beef, pork."
4,"Tete, was our server today for brunch & she was simply amazing!! My family & I eat here for brunch quite often but this particular server was amazing as she has served us twice now.

Firstly, she was knowledgeable & professional. She never kept us waiting (which is one of my pet peeve's at restaurants). She took our orders swiftly & repeated them back so we could be sure that they were correct. The bottomless mimosa's are the absolutely best. 

My family & I will continue to visit cheesecake bistro often as possible. Thanks Tete!"
2,"Peking Chinese Restaurant is one of those quick stop Chinese places with a large menu and good prices and friendly service, but little atmosphere or originality.   This is a place where you want convenience and the most popular Chinese dishes."
3,"I love food from Café Rio.  This place has the best sweet pork I've heard had.  I personally have no connections to Utah and don't really care about those who say I prefer the original places in Utah blah blah blah blah.  I will continue to frequent this location until something else better comes along.  And no, Costa Vida is NOT a valid replacement for Café Rio."
4,This place is seriously awesome!!! Had a few drinks and dinner outside at the barefoot bar. Bartenders and servers were very nice and fast. The food was awesome! Very good burger and salads. There are fire pits on the beach which I could have stayed at all night long. Would definitely recommend this place for all ages and types of parties!
3,it makes me so very happy to wander around thru world market.  You can find somethig for every budget here little do-dads and gift items and some cool pieces of furniture too...Once in a while you can even grab something marked down on clearance and then you know it is a really great day!
1,Not loving Carol house right now - waited 6 weeks for our couch and they delivered it with the incorrect throw pillows.
0,"Absolutely awful. My husband and I ordered a queso dip and we both got food poisoning. Called the manager this morning and all he said was that they haven't heard from more people getting sick, that he was very sorry. Really? That's messed up. Neither of us could make it to work today, being vomiting all day, and feel like a truck driver hit us.  
The management is absolutely terrible. 
This has nothing to do with the servers because they were great."
2,"Came here last night And the meal was very satisfying. The read beans and rice were very good! And my boyfriend enjoyed the Caesar salad as well. We also really like the daiquiris we ordered. What we did not enjoy was the gumbo. It came out almost cold and did not have much flavor. But our server and the atmosphere we loved. I would recommend for a quick bite to eat, but not if you are looking for a real New Orleans culinary experience."
0,Just stopped by at 9:30 on a Sunday night. Waited at the drive through and they closed 30 min ago. No explanation as to why.
4,"Everything was more than expected!!! Awesome custom service, friendly environment, clean, and the burger..... well let's just say it was amazing! I ordered a Rodeo Burger (medium) and it was cooked perfectly. Overall I would recommend anyone to come here as their menu is vast. 

A++"
4,"5 star
Legal expertise 
Professionalism
Courteous 
Keeps client involved 
Would definitely recommend Ostroff Injury Law"
4,"This place is muy bueno.
Will definitely come back again.
I truly liked everything I ordered. please do not change the quality of food.
Simply delicious"
0,"It is such a poorly ran place. The managers have no control over the employees that are working there. Support Technicians don't know what they are doing. Lisa, a employee with pink hair specifically, gave me an attitude when I asked for help fixing a game. She seemed like she did not know what she was doing while she ""tried"" to fixed a game also. The men's bathroom had poop hanging out of the toilet also. The food is nasty. It's cold and it took forever to come. Don't come to this place if you're expecting to have fun."
0,"It's very pricey bar food which would be fine if the service wasn't TERRIBLE.  We went in at 8:00 on a Friday night and it was a little busy but nothing outrageous, it took 20 min for a waitress to acknowledge us and we ordered our food and drinks together. My husbands chili came out promptly and it was a solid 40 more minutes and our waitress hadn't come back once and there was no sign of our food so we left."
0,If I wanted to be lied to I'd watch the news. Went to Helen's after my employer was contacted about them offering us 50% off a combo meal. Went in and ordered showed him identification but was told that there was ended already Even though I had an email that said it had not. Turns out I was not the only one who had this issue will not be coming back.
4,"Its a shame that this place only has 3 reviews so far.  Mazzah is one of things i identify Boise with.  During my stay in Boise, Mazzah was a source of joy.  The food is easily the best Mediterranean food in town.  After living for more than a year in bay area, i have to still say Mazzah is my fav Mediterranean restaurant.

The fry+fry-sauce combo is the killer.  The owners and people who work there are super cool.   The fact that they opened a 2nd one on park center closer to home made it even better for lunch time visits from Micron."
0,"Place was recommended; Keep in mind they feel they are a high class place; Actually we walked out.

Started to order...  Had to explain more than once after he repeated our order incorrectly.  Did not understand Bleu Dressing rather than  Vinaigrette for a garden salad.  Ordered a Whisky Sour Up!   Had to explain to him what that meant. A drink arrived; terrible and not served Up!  Gheeze...

Would not give them a 3rd strike...."
0,"Very unwelcoming. Terrible service. Waitress pretended to ""forget"" all our orders. Breakfast was sitting cold behind the kitchen counter. Coffee was also ""forgotten""."
3,"I've washed my clothes at laundromats all my life.  They differ in cleanliness, convenience and cost.   I like this one because of  the attendant, Donna.  She is friendly and helpful and always has a good story.  This place is very close to my home.  I never go on the weekend because of the crowds."
3,"Great place with a beautiful patio, very fresh ingredients nicely presented more than just a typical pizza place. Try the salads they are awesome."
4,"Love this place! Great options and very fresh fish. The seabass was substituted for the cod and I think that should be the norm! The farm salad was fresh and a perfect appetizer. We shared (2) amongst the table of 7,  and it was a perfect starter. This place replaced Blue Agave which was a favorite of mine, and Nectar did not disappoint. Hendricks martini was also great! Great job Nectar!!"
4,"Well this was the most enjoyable evening. Jammed packed so make a reservation!!  Bring your favorite beverage, friends, relax!  Not a place to be in a hurry, this is for the serious diner!!  Most attentive staff, clean and delicious !!!  
.  We will be back!   Yum!
Ooooooooo- the homemade tiramisu"
4,"Shay at AMPM Locksmith is a true professional, who even offered to come to my home to address my needs for making a spare car key. Was thrilled with the fast, professional and inexpensive service I received. Will not find a better deal or a nicer worker! Highly recommend"
2,"Pretty good food at a decent price. Definitely a HUGE step over outback, but still somewhat on the chain side."
4,I love a good deli and this is definitely one I won't forget. I used to work a few blocks away and always looked forward to lunch from Bridgeside. Great Turkey Clubs and Chicken Salad. Always fresh and huge portions.
1,"Overall ok food, ok service, way too cocky of pricing.  Forgetting our appetizer and overcooking our steak really didn't help.

Maybe they just need time to work out the kinks of being a new restaurant, but I definitely won't be back anytime soon."
0,This without question was one of the worst dining experiences Ive ever had.  We were a party of three no difficult orders. Still took forever to get our orders and one of them came wrong. Drinks are very weak. Had no silverware asked three different people for them. Had to go get them myself. Had to ask for refills. Would never eat here again or recommend. Sad part is I really liked my fajitas.
4,"This is some of the best pizza I have ever had.  To be honest, their regular plain pizza is just average.  But their specialty pizza like stuffed buffalo chicken, and the BBQ chicken, and the nacho pizza are all OUT OF THIS WORLD.  And the people who run the shop are super nice.   DEFINITELY recommended."
0,"First time turkey meal buyer. Absolutely disgusted. The turkey was raw when it was supposed to be fully cooked. Bloody n slimey and plain disgusting. Ruined Thanksgiving and can never get that day back. 
Best advice:  DO NOT BUY!!"
1,I ordered 3 pizzas with hand tossed dough. I don't like the fact that they put the cheese on the dough and not on top of the toppings. This caused everything to fall off the pizza. Also the dough was wet and undercooked in the middle. The biggest problem is that the dough is TOO SWEET! After a few bite it's disgusting!!!! I am very dissatisfied and want my $$$ back. My husband said the pizza tastes like pralines with pepperoni...gross!
0,We decide to get some chicken from KFC instead of pop eyes and it was horrible experience. We had to wait 30 mins for chicken to be cooked. We only order 12 pieces and it was half crispy and original and I want some wing and person told me they don't have any wings at the store. Last time I came here about 10 years ago they didn't have any chicken. I guess I will stop coming here for good.
2,I went in with my family on MLK day and they didn't have the necessary ingredients to make a Sicilian sandwich... I was shocked a first. That's the only reason I came in... wife and kids ate I ordered ahead to Capriotti's.. all is well in the world. Wife said she her sandwich was good. Toddler ate the quesadilla and my 8 yr old had a ham and provolone sandwich we made her eat.
4,"This is such a cool piece of history, I am glad we stopped by to appreciate the painter cave. It's kind of tucked in so easy to miss, but the sign is helpful. Also a great spot to hike when it's not too warm, will definitely visit again in the spring!"
0,"i really couldn't be bothered to review the products of this business because (as it's already been mentioned) the ""owner"" (or whatever his sorry little self may be), went out of his way to be a rude, demanding AHole to me. If you want a cute hat for a GREAT price check out Gorman Bros. or Sashay"
3,"Four stars just because the drive through people are awesome.  The guy was super nice and when I pulled up to the window --- best smile.  I love it when people just have that happy sparkle.  

My latte was hot and the service was fast.  I will have to check out the inside one day."
4,"Great popular dog park.  Street parking
great astroturf and lots of seating 
nice place to enjoy afterwork with your pup"
3,Delicious and authentic! Service was friendly. Hidden gem in Pennsauken and we will be back.
1,"Ford Focus... 4 days... OVER $800. ENTERPRISE... FULL SIZE CAR... 4 days... $450. Speaks volumes. Just the facts ma'am. Also, employees attitudes are not very welcoming. Seemed like they don't even want to be there. When you call you get ""Hello!"". No, ""Thank you for calling Hertz"", ""Hertz, may I help you"", or even just, ""Hertz! go pound sand""... Nice."
0,"Worst service ever  I waited 1 hour at 2am and then they did not have a shuttle 
I will never use them
Zero stars"
4,"Wasabi Sushi in Lakeview is truly a hidden gem of the neighborhood. I've tried a litany of menu items here from the basic rolls, to the special varieties, and even the dinner entrees. Along with the expedient service, Wasabi has never ceased to satisfy. 

Be sure to try the LSU and Yellow Dragon rolls, along with the Beef Teriyaki!"
0,"The owners are extremely rude and arrogant, if you don't look like you have money they'll deff give you the basic customer service."
0,"This restaurant is in desperate of update of maintenance. The ice machine was literally cascading like a water fall with water pouring out, overfilling the drain and poring all over the floor. The soda was just carbonation. 

It was dark and felt just uncomfortable and uninviting.  

The burger wasn't very good and I really don't have anything positive to say about the whole visit."
0,"Food 6 out 10
Service 1 out 10
Atmosphere 3 out 10.
Sorry won't be back 
It didn't seem that busy but we had the slowest waiter or he did not want to come to our table because we were seated way in the corner."
4,"The donuts here are delicious. I love donuts and this place is one of my favorite donut places in the country. The donuts are fresh and has plenty of sugar and icing - the way I like it! The prices are very reasonable. The outside looks a bit weird and when you walk through the entrance, you wonder if the place is open. But it is! There are a few tables and seats. I usually order to go. The owner is super friendly and I always enjoy my short conversations with him. I definitely recommend Pharoah's Donuts!"
4,"Best Pho I have ever had! Got the House Specialty Pho but left out the tripe (it's not really my thing). We also got the egg rolls, Bang Bang shrimp, pork and shrimp noodle bowl, and Sugar Apple smoothies. Everything was really delicious!"
0,Poor service from their vendor Fuddruckers. It's not them but it's managed by Harrahs. I'm now at 25 minutes waiting for fast food. Left a bad review on Fuddruckers as well only because I have time as I wait. Outrageous!
4,"Amazing healthy food! Went in here to grab something fast, and they had pre-made healthy salads that were ahhhmazing! Oh and I tried Maple Water which was kind of strange but pretty cool they had it!"
4,"The Scallop entee with the asparagus is like eating a symphony. Insert beautiful music here.
Finished with the green tea tirimisu; also amazing.
The service was fantastic. Shawn took great care of me. Chef Joe checked on me to make sure everything was good. This meal fired on all cylinders."
3,Ordered some to go food from here. The food was pretty good. But I must say it was pretty simple. You could easily make similar food at home. But food was hot and ready when we came to pick it up.
0,This place use to be so good. The camp host and parking people will harass you and ruin your whole trip. Not worth it. I got this spot six month in advance and was looking forward to our stay for weeks. Until we got there and everyone around us were harass every single time they could. Horrible horrible horrible
4,Went on a Sunday evening. The server Steph was awesome. Steak was delicious. Excellent people and excellent service. Enjoyed the meal and friendliness of the staff. Good stuff
4,"Stopped in here today. We split a cheesesteak & each had a slice of tomato pie. The cheesesteak was great. It was on a fresh roll with lots of meat covered in cheese. Not greasy, just right. The tomato pie made me wish I lived closer. Fresh tomatoes with real garlic on a delicious crust. The guy working the counter was friendly and there's plenty of seating. I'll be back for that tomato pie."
4,This is the best place in town to take your Ford. They are an amazing staff and we are going to miss them when we have to leave here.
1,"Pricey and yes the portions are huge, however the food needs to taste good as well. My Mom enjoyed her meal of Chicken fried chicken, mashed potatoes, and the creamed spinach. My daughter got the Creole chicken which she enjoyed and she also enjoyed the corn. She got the side of red beans and rice and it was inedible. I got the burger and fries. The fries were OK the burger however was just enormous with no care of how it tasted. A Quarter pounder with cheese is much better as far as flavor goes and price as well. We will probably not be going back."
4,"Absolutely delicious burritos!!! They grill or fry the cheese which I hadn't had before and loved! I got a veggie burrito - great mixture of veggies, beans and cheese + a small salsa bar to select from."
3,Great Cuban sandwich. Looks like they have a full bar. Atmosphere is kind of 80s. Good luck getting here as the traffic in this area is ridiculous.
4,This was our first time at the restaurant. It was small but very intimate.  We had the mixed kabobs which were fantastic.  I especially like the grilled vegetables.  They were perfect.  I will definitely  come back.  Oh an let's not forget the gentleman who took our order an the young man who served the food. They answered all our questions  about the different skewer and how they are made.
4,"Thank you, Nemours for bringing independent films to Wilmington, De. The theater is wonderful and run by kind-hearted volunteers.  I enjoyed two glasses of wine while watching a documentary called,"" No Place on Earth"". I love to watch independent films. Hopefully more people will come to support Nemours Theater."
4,"Love, LOVE this guy!! Honestly, take this tour if you do no other tour in NOLA. He's the dude that started haunted tours about 30 years ago. Did his own research & everything! If you want to see the creepy side AND be thoroughly creeped out, this is the tour for you! Excellent bar stop with recommendations for drinks! You will not be sorry! ‍"
3,Great dinner with my husband! Had the chicken fried steak. The gravy was awesome! The mashed squash was sooo good! It took a while to get our food because of a party going on. The manager came over to explain and apologize and offered a free dessert. Our waitress was the sweetest and said to choose the carrot cake which was awesome!! They also serve a good glass portion of wine. Will definitely go back. Would be a great place to bring the kids!
3,"Delicious egg nog ice cream. Not too sweet and right mixture of spices, specially nice with nutmeg and not overdone.  Good egg taste with not too much vanilla.  They did this right with all muted tastes.  Wish they had garbage outside since rest of sidewalk didn't."
4,"Love , love the sweet greens. Great staff and great management are easy to spot. Employees are kind and happy to help."
4,"Had breakfast there today around noon.  Had the chicken fried steak and it was amazing. My wife had the cinnamon and raisin French toast and it was incredible as well. The mimosas were huge, and tasted great. The wait was maybe 30-45 minutes which was surprisingly short considering the time of day on a Sunday. We sat upstairs and had a great waiter, forgot to get his name, be he did a awesome job. We will definitely be coming back. If your staying at the grove hotel, you can simply walk across the street"
3,"I came here for Sunday brunch and was impressed.  They had a wide variety to choose from, including eggs Benedict.  There was a large selection of cold items such as salad.  The dessert bar added to the variety. There was a chocolate fountain and a good selection of cakes and squares.   The food quality is pretty good. The only thing that would make it better is if they refilled your coffee.  The ambience is wonderful in an airy open section of the hotel.  Parking can be tricky if you don't know the area."
0,"Just terrible. The coffee is inconsistent, as is the 
help. I put up with it until today. I complained about a burned, grilled sandwich, which came with cold chili. I know burned butter/ oil when I taste it because I have done it,plus I know what burned looks, and cold feels like. She of course said I was wrong on both counts. I never have asked for my money back, and why would I want anything to eat from there? She also never offered. I left the food on the table."
4,"My father has used this service for years, always referring to them as his ""cleaning angels."" When my husband and I moved to the area, we decided to hire them to get into a good cleaning pattern before our baby was due. They are wonderful!!!!! Our house looks AMAZING and they were such lovely people! Truly, they did such a fantastic job. Very reasonable priced, especially for the service we were provided. We can't wait for them to come back!"
3,"My  boyfriend said it best, ""Saad's, how do you make food taste this good?"" I haven't ventured into the platters and more authentic dishes but I can say that I have dreams about the chicken schwarma and lamb schwarma wraps. Im in fact salivating as I type this review. Do yourself a favor and take a trip to this little spot and remember to respect their rules like keeping your cellphone off. A minor sacrifice for the party your mouth is about to have haha"
3,Just finished having lunch. Food was good and the young lady who served me was extremely polite.
4,Kirk Renga settled us in our life long family home managing through a very complex sales cycle. Can't thank him enough!
3,"Our stay was during renovations, but our room was nice and renovated (windowless, but nice). The staff was nice and courteous. There's a courtyard which was very pleasant and cute cat named Patrick who roams the courtyard. And the location is great for everything in the French Quarter!"
2,"I have Never been here before, its a small quiet place near where I live.  I tried the BiBimBop and of course one of my favorites Kimchi.  The food I ordered tastes like little or no msg, if I get sleepy in a hour I will know I'm wrong and post it on here."
4,"They are so so friendly and helpful!! I am the worst at going to the dentist. I would rather give birth again than go, but here they were very very understanding about my fears and made me feel"
4,"What a great atmosphere!  Very sophisticated and yet comfortable.  Cody was an efficient waiter and kept the energy going.  The food was delicious, healthy, and unique.  I look forward to coming back there soon!"
2,"I scheduled service at my residential property and they no showed.  Messaged owner thirty minutes after appointment and no response fifteen minutes later.

Contacted a half hour after appointment.  They came out an hour and a half later.  Apologized for inconvenience and gave 20% discount.  Solid workmanship."
4,"I just had a great Kale Ribbean Breeze recommended by Roy.  Very refreshing and filling.  Greate atmosphere and location.  Ask for Roy, he is very helpful and friendly."
3,"Had the french toast combo. It came with one egg and choice of bacon or sausage. I chose the sausage. Everything was great! Homestyle cooking. Would give 5 stars but the coffee was not that great. Customer service was good, not overbearing."
4,"Great communication before and during the job. Mario quickly fixed my mortise lock, which most other locksmiths wouldn't touch or would only completely replace."
4,"My stepdad, who works in South Tampa, recommended this place. We drove all the way from Seminole Heights and it was FANTASTIC. Excellent takeout and the gentleman on the phone was very nice. Will absolutely be back. 

Even my pokemom (mom), who is impossible to please, loved it. Thumbs up!!"
3,"The burgers are HUGEEEE. 

I love the concept of being able to sketch while waiting for the food. The restaurant is decorated with drawings, but it's really small. 

The fries are soooo good! Definitely get the fries. They are the best fries I have ever had! The burger will definitely fill you up and is really good. 

The burgers and fries are a little pricey, but worth trying."
0,This place is discusting.  Smoking and a dog was actually sitting on top of the bar where people eat.  Don't go
3,"Great local fave in quaint downtown Zionsville. A fantastic place to get a beer after work with a buddy or a group of friends. There's trivia on Thursday's and the atmosphere and ambiance of the old building brings this Chicago themed bar to life! It's upstairs, so be prepared to climb a flight of stairs when you enter the door! Friendly staff and local beer options as well!"
4,"Tuan was right on time and very efficient in fixing our issue! Extremely professional, easy to deal with, and had everything done within 2 hours of my initial call to him. The pricing was great and we are happy with the work."
4,"Based on beer selection only....ridiculous! Over 300 options and its all laid out for you in their Beer Bible.  I recommend a Pliny (if they have it).

Food smelled great too...didn't try and either.  Also...Pliny is short for Russian River - Pliny the Elder"
4,Their Pixie Stick flavor slushy is super good! And the alcohol soaked gummy bears were 2 containers for $5! Great deal!
4,I'm here like every other day. I love the breakfast food. It's simple and just what you need sometimes.
3,"Great food, great music, awesome bloody Mary's! Had the Ruben omelette, amazing! Just disappointed that no separate checks. Had brunch there today, we asked the waitress to split the check.it was a 50/50 split, she said no can do, the showed on the menu where it said no separate checks. Otherwise would have been 5 stars..."
4,Just had brunch at Roots. Sooo good!  Ate outside and had several options in seating. The food is ALWAYS fresh and delicious!!!!!
3,"Bartender John made the couple hours I spent here before a flight enjoyable. Very good service, friendly, upbeat, & quick service. Only a 4 star bc even though the cheesesteak is good it's not amazing. Thanks John!"
3,"What a gem. Food is delicious. Cash only spot- not ideal but there is an atm on premises. Server was sweet. Appetizers came out quickly... entrees not so much but it was worth the wait. It's on the pricey side too. Still, Looking forward to the next time."
4,"Amazing ""(not so) guilty pleasure"" treats! Matcha latte & dragon fruit soft serve is so good! Samples are a must, though it makes it harder to decide what you'd like to get.  Cute little spots to take pictures at & can even play pingpong outside. Indoor/outdoor seating available. Pet friendly! They also serve vegan soft serve for pups."
0,They had horrible services! Waited to be seated for 20 mins when there was tables already there to be seated. They were talking in their language which I understood saying that we were inpatient. So I explained that people have been waiting for 20 mins.
1,"Tried it again. Ordered through Grubhub. 15 minutes later order was cancelled. Called restaurant. Put on hold so long I hung up. What it the problem, people??"
4,"Wow. I had an amazing experience there today. I walked to get my nose pierced and was instantly happy because the building is the old movie theater that I spent much of my childhood in. They have done a great job of keeping the style of the theater while turning it into an amazing tattoo shop. I then met Forrest. He pierced my nose and was professional, intelligent, nice, calming, and informative. I will never go to anyone else. Thank you Forrest and Lone Wolf!!"
4,Super nice staff and owners.  Our go to place for a generous sized sandwich and freshly brewed coffee.
3,Fries kinda cold but poboy was awesome. Lady behind the bar was super cool. Got a double shot of Patron for $8 which wasn't too bad. I think I will return but not this trip!
4,"I am happy to have found a place to take my car! I went in for a tire and mentioned my ck engine light was on so they took a look at that too. Same day, no appointment. I knew the code was a misfire in a cylinder from a scan at AutoZone​.  They quickly found a couple spark plugs that were shot. They even showed me the plugs. My car was fixed same  day. I was pleased with the price and service. I have been hoping to find a shop in the ares that I feel is honest and fair. I found my shop."
4,"Dr. Childs is THE BEST dentist! He was highly recommended to us when we moved to Sparks, NV in 2002 and have been going to him ever since. Great with kids, adults, and even my 90 year old father is now one of his patients. Wonderful friendly staff too, every one of them!"
4,"This place never disappoints, the food even when cooked with oil is never greasy, the dumplings are a great size. I've had the curry mixed veg and the mapo tofu and the servings are generous without lacking in flavor. I don't order from any other Chinese restaurant around here."
0,"Was hoping to hit Brunch today on our way back from Sonoita & although it says it's open at 10 on Sunday it's not, opens at 11. It's always helpful when a place has correct hours posted on Yelp!"
4,"We tried the Al Pastor burrito and loved the caramelization of the pork, the touch of sweetness from the pineapple salsa, and great service to boot!"
4,This place got packed after I got my drink then next day yea line was outside wrapping the store front glade I got taste before rush and tea fever. Line was kind crazy. But honestly do agree it was good possibly healthy. And wait is not that long. Door dash and call in are available. Think ahead if you want enjoy sip of great flavors. Egg pudding added was great! I enjoyed it. Would post pic but I was too busy slurping away.
4,"This place was AMAZING! the bathroom had a TV in it that we were able to watch from our jacuzzi tub. The bed was so comfy. There was a spa,arcade , several restaurants and even a salon all inside the hotel. Plus room service and valet parking. They give you coupons for everything the hotel has to offer.Everyone was super nice. The rooms were really clean and while we were out, they cleaned our room and made sure everything was stocked. I will be going back next chance I get."
0,"If you want cheap nails that will break in half the next day come here! 
I got my nails done and the next day me and my friend I went with both broke our nails although we have been getting acrylics for months. Usually takes me a month to break nail after enough wear. Here the acrylic is so low quality it will break the next day. Also they charge $20 extra for gel ???? Why???
My friends nails were put on crooked and they refused to fix it and acknowledge it was crooked!
Awful service.  Don't go here for acrylics."
4,Great draft selection. We got a barrel aged bourbon ale. The live music was fantastic. We sat near the outdoor fire pit and it was perfect. The pork sliders were piled high and on chewy biscuity buns. The sweet potato fries were made fresh. Service was prompt. No problems. Fun time.
2,"Just had a great , quick breakfast.
Have only been here for breakfast a few times and it is really good. I really enjoyed the home fried potatoes this morning.
The guy next to me had a side of ham and it was so big it needed its own plate, definitely getting that next time."
3,"A rooftop patio with an incredible, unobstructed view of the pier and beach. Food is nothing special, but the view and atmosphere makes up for that. The servers and bartenders are very friendly. They give out a free shot for everyone as they count down to the sunset."
4,Jourdan is the most beautiful caring person I have ever met. A natural born healer.   She is beyond talented.  She has an incredible voice. I did a session in a class she presented in New York and I went so deep into Hypnosis and walked away feeling so awakened I could walk on air.
3,"Doctors are great! I like the technology there and how they set it up their station. 
The reception Amber, I am not sure if she is still there, as I do not see her anymore was very rude lady.
I did had many miscoding for my insurance claim, if I did not ask her to look into again and again it would cost me big $$$.
Overall satisfied with the service Dr. Andrew is very good"
3,Love this building and dining rooms. Food was mostly good. Had to ask for service. I expect servers to offer and ask what we need instead.
0,"This was the worst experience ever !!!! I TRUSTED them to deliver the Products I gave Sku #'s for over the phone. Moving someone to Chattanooga. Not only did they deliver late on Friday just before they closed after completing the purchase on Wednesday, they delivered items I didn't select knowing I was traveling early on Saturday. Tried calling to discuss and was place on hold for 30 mins until infinity. They have never responded. Don't TRUST them. !!! Buyer beware. The power is in My HANDS !!!"
4,"Best authentic Italian food in the area. Food is always amazing. Staff is excellent and very attentive. Highly recommend Bombato Cioccolatino for dessert, heavenly."
4,"This was my 1st whale watching excursion and it was amazing! We saw so many Blue Whales, Humpbacks and hundreds of dolphins! The Capt was great with all her info, the volunteers were very helpful and great with kids. The weather was spectacular as well, although I am sure they didn't really have anything to do with that.. but they were so good, maybe they did conjure up the weather too!"
4,Great rolls. Fresh. Creative. Fairly priced for the quality. Atmosphere is contemporary yet romantic. Great date or lunch spot. A hidden gem in Tampa. Volcano roll is best on the menu.
4,Not only the best airport food ever BUT the best pizza ever! I'm a Jersey girl so I know pizza. I was shocked at how delicious the bacon-cheeseburger slice was. (See photo) Like a gourmet Big Mac! The 3 gentleman working were also friendly & accommodating; welcoming every customer.
2,Came by on a Wednesday night for dinner and drinks. We are out of towners and saw good re Jews on Yelp. Very cool place. VERY busy. More of a bar scene than a restaurant. Looked like a good menu but we didn't eat here since it was way too busy (which is a great indication of a good place) bartender was friendly too.
2,"Love having beer and wings but not so crazy about the food. Service is always decent, I really like the idea they have good spaces for larger groups."
4,"Welcome to the kingdom of emperor MustacheMan.

Possibly the best bowl of BBH (BunBoHue) in Edmonton. Perfect for cold Alberta winters and filling a hungry stomach. Don't be discouraged by the decor or elevator music. We are here for only one thing. 

Want to man up? 32XL BBH with (thin noodles - this is key unless you want to be pillaged by ever expanding regular BBH spaghetti style rice noodles) + 2x Extra meat. This is a true test of a man. Don't forget to do the meat cheers with the extra meat bowls."
2,"The service here can be spotty.  But the food generally makes up for it.
The nachos and the Mexican pizza are very good.  Beware of the salsa if you don't like a little heat.   If you are in the mood for Mexican you won't go wrong here."
3,"This theatre is on the second floor up the escalator, and once you find it... it's very nice. Not your regular theatre, more options of refreshments and drinks . However prices are lower than regular theatres for popcorn and drinks Anne's that sold me! The theatre is nice and clean and seats are very comfy. It definitely is a nice theatre and I'll be going back. The wonderful thing is that it plays a lot of foreign films and smaller venues films. It's nice knowing, I can probably find the film not in other theatres."
0,"It's highly unfortunate the experience we had last night in the bar. The service was slow to nonexistent and with an attitude. When it's a holiday, either staff up, or don't be open. 
A disappointing evening at such a fine resort."
4,"Words can not describe the experience.  It is amazing what can be done with the colors, shapes, and styles. A true art - cant wait for next year!"
4,"I visited from California and heard great things about this place. I had to try it. It's the best pizza I've ever had. The crust isn't thick or thin, it's just right. The crust is also crunchy and chewey. I highly recommend it. Sorry, no pics of the pizza-ate it all"
1,Got a mixed bag of service here. The woman treated me like a criminal and wouldn't let me look around on my own. She jumped in front of me and wouldn't let me pass and was rude when I said I knew what I was looking for and size. The rental area was a different experience the guy was nice and answered all my questions. He treated me like a person. He is the only reason I added any stars
3,I had a great time great atmosphere great food and a great View. I have the Nashville hot chicken taco and it had great flavor.
4,As always had the most delicious meal at Barone's Tuscan Grill Tonight!  Our server Taurie  was AMAZING!! Great suggestions and service!!! I highly  recommend this place!! Perfect little hidden Gem!!!
2,"Very expensive place to shop. Decent liquor selection, but I've seen better. Aisles were decently laid out and staff was ok, but this place costs notably more than several other places in the area. The store was at least clean, but this is not a really a go-to...more like a keep looking."
1,"Sad to say....the other reviews aren't exaggerating.
Food - salty and cold. How can one screw up pasta? Go here to find out.
Service - service gets 3 stars since they did take one of our dishes back and remade it....though it still sucks."
1,"Food is good but my main concern is the plates they serve. They served us very hot rice and korma in those disposable plates and sadly the plate had impressions of rice and some rice got stuck under the plate which is very scary. Basically the plate got melted as the food was very hot. 
Please consider the health of your customers. It's basically a to-go place I understand but take some precautions when serving in those disposable plates."
4,Dr Heaton has helped me so much the few times I have seen him. Sure no one likes hearing all those pops but trust me your body will love you for it! The office staff ladies are so sweet and helpful. When I return it feels like family greets you and everyone is always smiling. I would highly recommend going to this chiropractor! They do accept insurance and also have a discount program incase you don't have insurance. Very reasonable prices.
2,"I've come here a couple times and gotten their pulled pork plate with sweet potato fries. I've tried their artichoke, Mac & cheese, and corn bread as well. This isn't a place I'd choose to come back to again and again because I thought the flavors were a bit bland and the menu wasn't that exciting. However, if you really like BBQ or southern style food then I do recommend it."
4,"I have been to this place many times. I have always enjoyed the ambiance , service and food . I am so happy they have open up in Santa Barbara. My waiters have always been great and tonight Olivia was one of the best."
4,"Normally, I consider pizza a safe bet when I'm in a hurry and don't want to think too much about where to eat.  However, Pi's Delmar pizza was not only the best  pizza I have ever eaten, it is among the best meals I've had.  The staff's attention was extremely helpful especially when it came to recommending the predecessors beer for my palate."
3,"The definition of a dive bar, right down to the half-dressed bar stools. Don't let looks deceive. The food is delicious and they have a wide array of goods drinks."
4,This was an amazing experience. The ambiance of the restaurant was absolutely wonderful. The seating options were wonderful and the decor was great. The servers were all extremely kind and helpful choosing what to eat. The food was INCREDIBLE. We got multiple share plates and split everything between us. Everything was delicious and the portion sizes were really good. The flavors were wonderful and even our friends who weren't vegan enjoyed.
4,The best hoagies in South Jersey Period!!!! Where else can you get bread that has been cooked fresh all day for a hoagie? The bottom of their seeded bread is terrific I can't say enough about this place
3,"I was a little nervous by the one star rating but it was only one rater so far.  I used a groupon and there was no problem or issue redeeming it.  The building was a little hard to find, there is no sign outside.  The massage itself was great.  The table was heated which was great because it was 32 degrees outside but I would definitely not enjoy that in the summer!   Pressure was great and I liked picking my own aromatherapy because some of them can smell terrible."
4,"Love their sushi rolls! Miso soup is wonderful also. I've tried their sumo roll and Neptune roll and they're both great! Also, they have a great selection of half priced appetizers during the week!"
0,The manager actually yelled at my younger child for taking some rice off of nigiri- my son got too much wasabi on the one piece!of sushi. There wasn't a pile of rice in front of him. This type of behavior from a manager is inexcusable!
4,"Did you know they have the best gluten free pizza in town?  I was very surprised that I actually prefer the gluten free pizza over the regular pizza.  You can't really go wrong, everything is good at Puccini's!  My favorite is the lunch options during the week. For under  $10, you get a slice of pizza, a side salad and a drink.  Not bad at all if you're on a budget."
3,"Best thrift store in Tucson! Lots of selection, and there's usually a particular color tag that's 50% off each day. The store is roomy and well-lit, though the last time I went it seemed a little dingy and chaotic. Overall, a great place to look for clothes you'll only use once (Halloween costumes, coats for trips out of town, etc.), rarely-used small appliances, and the like."
2,"My mom and I stopped here when we couldn't go to The Barking Dog because it's closed on Sundays.  The food was good, but not anything particularly special.  I had the meatloaf which looked kinda weird, but was quite good (although I like my mom's meatloaf better).  Our waitress was very friendly and attentive.  If you're looking for typical diner food at a decent price served to you by friendly waitresses, then go for it.  I wouldn't make a special trip, though."
4,"Excellent food and service!  To tell you how perfectly seasons the food is: my husband, who salts everything, did not even LOOK for salt!  My chicken mole was awesome!  The guacamole with the smoked pecans on top was great (and we're from Texas).  Our waiter was terrific, even running out to the street after us with the umbrella I had forgotten!  I only wish I could remember his name; he was fantastic!  We will tell all our NOLA friends to come by and try!"
2,"Like with all things important on ones to do list: the early bird gets the worm. (DMV etc) I would hate my job if I worked here and it seems like most of the staff really do. The security guard kept the conversation light and even made me laugh, so it was a nice way to pass the time. You must have all if the necessary documents. They will not let you slide with substitutes!"
3,"Very great place to shop for cigars, pipes, or lose leaf tobacco, and they can special order stuff for you!"
3,"Fun for the whole family! 

Bookman's has a little bit of everything for everyone, and what's also awesome you can bring your dog in on a leash!  New items coming in everyday."
4,"I decided to make the long drive to Kim Son's. We went there when they first opened about 30 years ago. As a combat Veteran from 50 years ago, I remembered how much I loved Vietnamese food. We generally skipped the Chinese dishes because there are plenty of them around but many times we did indulge on it. When I found out they were closing, I decided to make the trip and gorge myself. Thank-you for 30 years of providing great service and delicious food! I'm sure I've had everything on the menu and some things that weren't over the years! Happy retirement."
4,"I'm not a vegan, but this is quickly becoming my favorite coffee shop in town. 

Good coffee, super friendly staff. The sandwiches are tasty and hearty. The baked goods are delicious. The rooms are beautiful and tidy and spacious. There are interesting books and zines for browsing. There is artwork on display and for sale (at reasonable prices). You get the option of a bottomless cup of coffee for a few cents more than the regular cup. Oh, and wifi, naturally. This place has pretty much everything I look for in a coffee shop. Well done!"
4,"Best sushi in downtown Indy 

Forty five degrees is trendy and stylish. The staff is extremely friendly and welcoming. They're already up to offer new items to try or to answer any questions you may have about the menu. 

BONUS- Sunday's is half priced sushi. YASSSSS! They also offer delivery on yelp- it's a win win! 

The wait is never too long and the restaurant is able to accommodate large parties or small intimate ones. You can also call ahead and reserve a table!"
4,"I started seeing Liz at Empower within the last year and could not recommend her/the whole salon more! Such a cute place and everyone there is so friendly. The products that they use are all more smell, skin, and hair friendly than most salons I've been to and you don't get hit with the stench of ammonia right when you walk in, so I felt totally safe visiting while pregnant too which was huge!"
4,"We ordered the butter chicken, chicken masala, and garlic naan.  It was excellent.  We went on a Saturday night and we were the only ones there.  It was very quiet and the service was good. I would definitely go back."
2,Food good and service great. But price did not match the serving size. Serving sizes were very small and I felt like prices are higher than they need to be.
4,Seriously the best tacos in Indy! Tastes just like you're in Mexico and I've been there a lot. I implore everyone to give them your money and get the Molé tacos!
2,"This is probably the largest Produce Junction I have shopped at.    

They have push carts so I don't have carry and plenty of parking.     Not all locations have these things

 They have great prices and a large supply of fruit, veggies and plants.

It's great if you need to buy stuff and use immediately.  Doesn't have a long shelf life

Con- cash only.  Pay for fruit at one counter and veggies at another counter"
4,"This is a keeper, wonderful cuisine: fresh seafood with Latin American flair. Food was as good as it gets anywhere, service outstanding, Atmosphere fun, but quiet enough to converse at normal tone of voice.  Very reasonable prices.  We will be there a lot! One of those places in Tucson which makes this small city a foodie heaven."
4,"Best happy hour in town. Quality food and quality atmosphere. Great friendly, attentive, service!! Most importantly, great house/lounge music!!"
4,"Top notch every time. Absolutely love the Mami chicken and I'd gladly vouch for this being the best Cuban sandwich in Tampa Bay.

Also can't beat the value.

As a bonus, they have exceptional cheesecake and other homemade desserts. If they have their brownie cheesecake in the case do not leave without a slice!"
4,The flavor of this place is Fullblast! The Crab Cake Benedict & Creole Shrimp & Grits were CRAZY good.
4,"Over all great experience and a feeling of home ..
 Red sauce is  great !  Welcoming service and servers very friendly and attentive .. BUT the ART !Very cultural experience lots of local mexican traditional and contemporary art ..wonderful !"
2,I really enjoy coming here with friends.  We always sit at the bar.  Food is always good but it seems like it takes forever...it's bad when you wonder if they out your order in or not.  Service was alright this time.  They checked on us often but when we asked for certain things they forgot and we had to ask another bartender.  I would have given it four stars but the slow service is why I have it three.  It's worth a try!  Like I said I love the food!
1,"Yesterday i stood around waiting for some help for at least 15 minutes. Meanwhile employees just hung out in small groups chit chatting. When I finally walked up to a small group and interrupted their conversation I was greeted with attitude. The employee didn't talked about the product I was interested in. Instead he behaved as though he was on stand answering questions by an accuser. He certainly didn't want to be there. I finally just told him to get me the product, paid and left. What happened to Apple?? Innovation, quality and customer service. I see this now mostly in my rear view mirror."
1,This place is really bad. The portions are definitely reflected in the price and the food is average but the service is laughable. I have never seen a place with so many people frustrated at once with the servers. Personally a waitress performed the ALS ice water challenge on my wife and didn't bother to apologize. But other people hadn't been served for 20 minutes. With so many other good choices around greenwood don't waste the time.
0,I loaded about $300 worth of construction materials and supplies into my truck and went here to donate them. The kid they sent out went in to talk to his boss then came back out and said they couldn't use anything. One of the items was a $200 utility cart plus other tools that were saleable. The manager was too lazy to even come take a look. I was willing to only give them things they could use and I would have disposed of the rest. I am sure The Idaho  Youth Ranch will be happy to receive the donation.
4,"I went with friends the first time.  We got to work with Paul.  The second time I took my kids and a friend, and we worked with Chipmonk.  Every time I went we had a blast!  Everyone is amazing!  Landon at the front desk is wonderful!  5 stars for great employees, customer service, and leaving feeling like a winner or a total (Bad Axe!)
See you all again soon!"
3,"Good spot for a drink.  We arrived around 1:00am on a Thursday night and it was a quite dead by then.  However, the cocktails were solid and the bartender was hot.  The decor was a little too stuffy and old fashioned for my tastes."
0,There was about the same amount of employees to guest .....employees where more interested in the regulars.....took me 40 minutes to get my flatbread it had a bad taste like dirt....spoke to the manager he said he would take care of it........5 minutes later he was sitting in the corner bullshitting with the staff.....took me 1 hour to get a beer and a bad flatbread
2,Pretty goo Cajan food. Crawfish étouffée needs some help.
4,"Been ordering take out from Fuel for some time now.  I find the food to be great lunch options.  Appreciate the lettuce wraps!

Im sure a lot goes into it but I feel they should take the prices of the smoothies down by a buck.  Today I spent $40 on one Fiji water, an avocado shake (very good!), and two rice bowls."
0,"Noooooooooo snooty overpriced jerks that don't like locals.  $10 beers.  Empty tables all over and said they were reserved.  BS.  Oh and it's full of smelly dead meat.  Weird.  Very politely kicked us out, props for that.  This place is full of old people."
4,"Went in with a friend who was getting a salad. She was being helped by Esa and overheard that I'd never been to Sweetgreen. She offered me a salad on the house and it was AMAZING! Got the harvest salad which she says is the ""best in Philly"" and she was right--very fresh. I would highly recommend this place. Great service!!!"
4,"I tried this place for the first time last week, and it will definitely be my pizza recommendation for SB from now on. I kind of just stumbled into the place, after choosing to not go to Sam's to Go on the Mesa. The guy who took my order recommended his pepperoni and roasted garlic pizza--though not crazy, was extremely delicious. 

Will return and will recommend."
0,"They can't operate Apple Pay correctly. They ask for the last 4 digits of your credit card, which is not supposed to be required for using Apple Pay. Then the last 4 digits don't work, so you're backto plastic anyway. If they get this working I'll change my review."
4,Always great. Consistently good! In this area this is the best spot for sushi. I highly recommend. Sit outside on a nice evening.
4,"HOLY SMOKES those pretzels are good! Great service from the bartender-- very attentive. Food was delicious and very prompt despite the busy dinner hour. I was highly impressed! Very warm, mature atmosphere. Will take future business clients there most definitely! Keep up the exceptional service and divine food!!"
4,"One of my favorite places in Philly when I am craving for some Schezuan style cuisine. I am not a fan of their dumplings which are nice but I dont get the brown (plum?) sauce on it as I am more into savory than sweet stuff. However, I have never been disappointed by their main course like dry pepper style chicken, hot sauce style chicken and mapo tofu - delicious!"
4,"This place is absolutely amazing!! The atmosphere, the service and most especially the food!! I am so glad we picked this place, the yelp reviews lead us here and didn't disappoint!!! If you are in town and looking for a good authentic Cajun cuisine, you definitely need to come to The Lost Cajun!!"
4,"Love the small plates this restaurant offers. Everything is fresh, tasty, and reasonably priced. The bartender was super friendly and very helpful. Great selection of draft beers as well as cocktails.  Perfect for brunch, lunch, or dinner. Highly recommend checking this place out!"
3,There chicken here is absolutely ridiculously delicious. It's tender/juicy and fall off the bone good. The service is good and we got a table right away.
0,I wish I could write a review but we waited almost an hour and a half and never got seated. We were told it would be an hour but this was crazy. So we left. Don't try to go here unless it is not mealtime.
2,"Very fast service, breakfast was good, had biscuits n gravy and eggs, coffee was average at best, will come back when I want a very fast meal!"
4,Amazing staff and food. Recommend the blackened red fish. Expect a little bit of a wait. Make sure you have an appetite.
3,"Really liked this place -- menu, wine selection, service, delivery. All top flight in a city with a sufficiency of good restaurants."
4,Great experience! First time here and loved how my hair turned out. Meredith was so sweet and took plenty of time to go over the options for my hair and what the healthiest options were. Highly recommend.
0,"I dealt with a salesman at this dealership that was extremely misleading!!! I made a 3 1/2hour trip to do business with this person and he pretty much turned out to be a ""yes"" man telling me yes to any question I had just to get me to make the trip and come sign the papers. Once I got there nothing we had discussed turned out to be true. DON'T WAIST YOUR TIME, ENERGY OR MONEY HERE!!! THEY ARE ALSO VERY DISHONEST AND TRY TO CLOSE A DEAL, EVEN BY LYING TO YOU AND/OR THE BANKS!!!!"
4,Great Fried Chicken... and Gluten free!  You cannot taste any difference with them using gluten free flour!
1,"I was very disappointed this evening with the service at Chipotle.  The person filling my order could barely be heard and was very skimpy with the portions.   I added Guacamole to my order, which was extra and I watched the server put a scoop full in the container and then scoop some out."
4,Bambu is a great hidden gem inside the casino.  Mike the sushi chef is the nicest and most personable sushi chef I have ever met.  He make something special for me every time I come in there.
4,"Excellent coffee, service and environment. Nice place for a meetup or relax on your own."
3,"I have always liked Meijer and when we moved to Fishers, it was one of the first places I looked up. They have a great variety of products and the shelves always seem fully stocked. This store is usually pretty clean and the staff are polite. Their Mperks program offers mobile coupons and Mperks members only discounts. I can't say that the Mperks program is always beneficial but every little bit helps!"
3,"My favorite evening activity in all of New Orleans. I've never been a huge fan of a lot of live music but this was so cute and the people were amazing! Particularly the guy on the sax!

In whole I loved the vibe here. Super chill, and all inclusive. This is the epitome of the New Orleans spirit imo. Young, old, men, women, it was so nice to all share the music together. 

Knocking off a star bc the drinks were eh and the price was pretty high but other than that, HIGHLY recommend for a chill and community-esque feel."
3,"we drop in from time to time.  our fave girl is Dana.  always happy go lucky, and quick to serve you.  this is a nice dark bar, great for games, or just for a change of pace.  located centrally for your party needs, and they don't mind if you bring a pizza in, (cross street) 

always have a great time here, drinks are stiff, not overpriced, and the clientele friendly."
0,I would not use this company nor could I ever recommend them.  They delayed a mortgage 30+ days with 40% down+ we had assets to prove we could pay off the mortgage if needed.
0,"Both my boyfriend and I felt extremely ill after eating the steamed seafood bucket.   Sadly we spent the rest of the day throwing up.  Other than painful nausea and frequent trips to the bathroom, the service and atmosphere was fine."
4,Delicious food and desserts.  The Turkish coffee was excellent.  Service was good and everyone was very helpful.
1,"always loved this place but this week came and order a flank steak had good flavor but all the food we ordered was COLD so disappointed cause we really enjoy the place and one more thing IF HORCHATA SELLS ALOT WHY YOU DONT MAKE ENOUGH  LIKE SERIOUSLY!!!hope i have a better experience, Next time hagan mas Horchata no mamen!!!"
0,Baggage folks are really bad. Entire operation does not care about their job. Avoid if possible.
0,"I had to call the restaurant about 4 times to place an order even though they were open, they then put me on hold for 10+ mins and after I finally placed the order I asked for the price and how long it would take and the person on the phone said ""I don't know, do you still want it, if I don't give you the price"" what the actually fuck does that mean? So fucking rude DO NOT EAT HERE!"
4,"Jarrin is a rockstar!!! Always so helpful and knowledgeable. I suggest if you ever go to Verizon, go see Jarrin."
0,"Nice Store. Very spacious. Nice Employees.

Purchased Dog Food and with a ""$5.00 off special"" it was still $15.00 higher than at PetSmart  (about 8 miles further).  The convenient location does not justify gouging their customers. Will not purchase anything from this chain, until they at least become price competitive!!!  

PETCO....WAKE UP AND SMELL THE COMPETITION!!!"
2,"Lots of options compared to other places like this, but quality isn't quite as high.  Parmesan steak was the best. Everything else was just ok.  Seemed a little unorganized also.  Came by with the same things 3 times while we went the entire time not seeing 1-2 things. Basically $40-$50 gets you a ton of food, but it's an occasional thing. Would rather spend $30 on a single item or two and it be amazing. Honestly I would pay them $30 to just keep bringing me the same 1-2 things I liked over and over."
2,"Pros: clean and nice atmosphere. Live music during the week night. 

Cons: food was mediocre. Service was nonexistent. The waitress took our orders, served them and disappeared for the rest of the night!! She only reappeared to drop off the check. Keep in mind this was a non busy Tuesday night with less than 10 tables occupied in the entire restaurant and with sufficient staff! This was unacceptable."
3,"Pablo is the best.  This shop includes local art and cute, creative furniture pieces. The influence and essence of this retailer came from it's founder Ryrie Valdez who retired and moved on to Reno.

Pablos' verve and attitude are superb. He is a true craftsman and as creative as you request. Every framing is 'custom'!  Bravo Pablo."
3,"Great customer service made our sandwiches after placing phone order minutes before closing! Friendly staff all around!

 Turkey club and French onion drip are great options and the portions are very generous!"
3,"We got the #1 for two. Spicy butter, lemon pepper season. Amazing flavors! Potatoes were a hit. Of course the crab and shrimp were amazing. We will be back! See you soon."
0,Pretty terrible.  Some cheap holiday decorations and $20+ bad tasting drinks in snow globes.  They seriously need a doorman to control the crowd size or something as this has to be unsafe.    Absolutely no room move.  People kept getting log jammed coming in and out.  If you absolutely must go I recommend going during the week or when they first open.
3,man it made me full like i ate at  2pm its 7pm im still full i like is this really Chinese food lol food was good rice was a bit blah but all & all it  was good 4****
4,"So good! Just left there and was not disappointed. Just had general Mexican food fare, tacos, guacamole, tostadas,  but it was all delicious!  Our server was sweet and attentive. This was our second visit and we will definitely be back!"
0,"Makes my stomach hurt. Food is okay, tastes funky and fake, you know? I would not eat here again.

I recommend Chipotle over this stuff."
4,"Place was pretty chill, played beer pong . And had some shots. Def recommend coming here, really fun, and college vibe"
1,"The only thing I enjoy about this place would be the lower prices; however, the quality of their work and customer service is always lacking. I'd rather pay more elsewhere."
4,The location for this place is beautiful. The service was superb! I loved all the food that we ordered especially the lamb. It doesn't get much better than this.
2,"We ordered takeout and our order was ready on time. Parking was a mess on a Friday night at the mall. Other reviews mention reserved parking for takeout, bit we couldn't find it and there was no note of it during the online ordering process.

The food was OK. The lettuce wraps were good, as always, but the honey chicken tasted a bit off to me. This is my go to dish at PF Changs but the flavor was different than usual and didn't taste good."
4,"I'm so happy this place exists! Got a chance to try it tonight for the first time and I have to say, their style and flavor is on point. Vermicelli bowl and rice paper rolls were so good. What a great addition to the neighborhood. I love the combination of a casual feel and excellent food. Everything tastes clean and fresh with no shortage of flavor. Furthermore the prices are very reasonable. I will definitely be back."
0,"first time ever here. ordered a burger, bacon mushroom
swiss, asked for no bacon, got a plain burger with no mushroom or swiss. received the remake with bacon. asked for my burger medium, it was well. the bartender who seemed like she couldn't handle the crowd had a pissy attitude. will not be returning."
0,"Unmitigated disaster. 1.5 hour wait from order to receipt of order. Greasy, cold chicken and catfish platters. Eye rolls and excuses aplenty from the staff. The hype surrounding Bolton's is utterly bewildering."
4,"Incredible! One of my favorite hotels. We brought my chihuahua, felt welcome even with her with us in the lobby. They offered Veuve Champagne when we checked in. The rooms are spectacular, a Mediterranean feel to them, spanish tile. Love this place!"
1,I heard good things but did not have the same experience myself. I ordered the white meat  jerk chicken and I was so disappointed. It was more like spicy bbq ketchup chicken. It did not have the jerk flavor or smell. You guys have to do better. My cabbage was good though.
3,"Get the hummus! It was truly unique and masterfully crafted. Further, our service was delightful. A completely innocent mistake in the order of appetizers turned into a complimentary beer and app. All around classy and unique."
0,"The food was good but service was horrible. We had to keep asking for refills, to clean dirty dishes, etc. She kept forgetting things. I ordered a margarita. After ten mins I asked about it. She forgot, then there was no bartender. No bartender? Management doesn't know how to tend bar or at least tell people the bar is closed?  Bad experience all together."
1,"Who gets gluten poisening at a restaurant that caters to the healthy? Me! Mediocre fish tacos somehow were cross contaminated with something gluteny. Meh. Nice location, nice patio, meh food. Meh."
3,"This update is dedicated to the PTR burger. It  Its technically the first of my burger reviews -  prior to deciding that its time to work my way through every phila taproom burger i can find.

This unusual take on the burger works: its served with an egg, truffle oil, gruere & arugula on a french roll. Not your usual burger combo, but really unique flavor. Hope they make it a staple. $10.

Burgerlicious rating = 7"
0,Absolutely useless store. I called ahead and reserved an item for them to put on hold at the front so that I could pick it up a couple hours later. I drove 30 minutes and went to the check out. They sold what they put on hold for me to someone else. Manager did nothing but say they would get another shipment in next week. Terrible business that wasted an hour of my time and a lot of gas. I'm speechless for what to say about how they run their business.
0,My wife and I came here for lunch. We both thought the prices were high the place was empty. The food that we got was below average at best. I will say the onion rings that I got we're good. If you want good seafood head more towards the water. Will not return
4,Elegant and exquisite.  Terrific customer service.  We had Patrick as a server for two nights (he was so good we requested him the next night)  gorgeous setting too!
3,"I love this restaurant, but often forget about it! I've been here with large groups as well as just two diners. They do tend to get busy, so I recommend a reservation. It can also get a tad loud, but the food is wonderful. I last went there with my mother and we split their two specials. A filet with scallops and crab three ways. They were both incredible!"
3,"This is a great water front, casual restaurant.  Nothing fancy about the menu, however the food is very good for what it is.  The drinks were very well made.  Great ambiance.  
The calamari is just average, the service was not great.  But for what it is, a bar that serves good food  on the water, it does it very well."
3,Great food but wait is very long always and it is loud  there. Loved their old place better as it was more cozy.
2,"I'm generously giving 3 stars because the atmosphere was different and I had the night with my daughter all to myself.  Wine selection good and waiter was knowledgeable.   Food pricey and small portions.  I enjoyed flatbread and my daughter liked her risotto.    iPads were a good idea to check out wine pairings but I did not use it for our order.   Two peeves. It was hard to distinguish staff from customers since all dressed differently. Did not take away soup bowl when my entree was brought.  
May stop in again for drink after shopping but not for dinner."
4,"Our server explained that Cuzco is a shared mission of three Peruvian families. I felt like I was eating a home cooked meal. Great flavors, sauces, and portions. A great addition to the neighborhood and New Orleans."
3,"Really good tacos and sides! We ordered the chicken, carne and pork tacos. All were good but we liked the pork the best. We did prefer ours a bit spicier so feel free to add some hot sauce. Daily made frescas were a nice change from the usual beverage options you will find. We liked both the pineapple and lime. The real winners were the side dishes. We ordered the black beans and plantains which were tasty and the Elote aka Mexican corn was fabulous! Well deserved high ratings, we concur!"
0,"Just stopped into Mr. Wish as I do at least twice a week because it my favorite bubble tea place in the area. At 5pm, they are out of bubbles and expected me to wait 30 minutes for a new batch to be made. All I can say is that's really poor planning for a ""bubble tea"" business. Whoever runs this store may need to look into better analytics for their business! Not sure if I will go out of my way to be potentially disappointed again!"
4,"Came here 30 years ago and George is still here.  

Great food and very fresh.  Great menu!!"
0,"The owner of this restaurant is a rude, intolerant jerk who does not deserve your business.  It's remarkable that the servers are sweet and polite, since management treats is customers like garbage that they can't get out the door fast enough.  Never eat here, no matter how hungry you are; there's a great Wawa right up the street.  A true shame, Ewing Diner.  A true shame."
0,"I want to start by saying that I have tried to leave reviews for this place before, yet they get flagged each time and taken down. If you cannot handle criticism then you have no business being on this website. No company is perfect, but you people aren't even good. Poor care for the elderly is all I have seen."
0,"I went to change my look and I left with the same color and a killer headache, ......................................"
3,Reasonable prices and polite staff. My pedicure looks great and has lasted for a while. Don't expect anything fancy with the pedicure. Just clean and paint nails.
3,Nice spot. Staff is extremely friendly and welcoming. The food was great for pub food and the beer selection was perfect. I wish it was a bit bigger of a place so more cab enjoy it. If I am ever in St Petersburg again I will return
4,Tangled Web always has a great supply of yarn and a knowledgeable staff.  They are helpful and quick to notice finished projects.  I feel like the stock always has something perfect for my upcoming project; I just wish they'd expand the sock yarn offerings.
0,"This chipotle does not except phone calls or online ordering, good luck waiting 30 minutes in line. The line is always busy..."
3,"We had a great evening. These guys really know how to work with greens; my pear salad was great, as was my arugula side, which was really only big enough for one. I'd like to go back and try more of the entrees. Service was very good."
4,"Oh man! This was the very first place I visited while in Philadelphia and I have to say I really, really, really, really loved it. I mean, this place has everything! Cheesesteaks, check; donuts, check; breakfast, check; fresh meats, check; fresh produce, check, check, check!! 

It reminded me of a mixture of Chelsea Market and Eataly in NYC. I tried a few of the food places there and I wasn't disappointed. This is definitely one of the places I enjoyed the most from my visit to Philadelphia."
3,"Who likes paying for car repairs? I don't. However, when you need dependable service...this place delivers. I appreciate that they share concerns about my vehicle's needs but they explain the list in priority. I have never been pressured or led to believe that I have do the whole list right away. I trust these guys."
3,"We really enjoyed this place. The restaurant is very clean and nicely decorated; even the bathrooms are tidy and decorated. The food was very tasty, good size portion, and nicely priced. My husband and I got potstickers, two entrees, and steamed rice (which comes with the entrees), and we had leftovers to take home. Server was friendly and attentive. The sesame chicken was our favorite!"
4,"Salad is good for your heart!

Salad bar rocks!

Love the salad bar! I am so glad they reopened!

This is the first time I had to hunt for a table!  The recession is over!  People are coming out of their homes again.  Yay!  I love to see crowds."
2,"Ordered a house burger (cheddar cheese, bacon) and fries for $10. Good burger. The fries were great. They make their own ketchup. Domestic beer is $3. The craft beer could be a little cheaper. Service was good. They could stand to turn up the lights in there. It was dark."
4,"This has to be hands down the best Steak and Seafood restaurant in Tampa. It all starts with the ambiance of this beautifully situated restaurant. It's tucked away in the HRH Seminole Hotel. The staff treats you like royalty. We had Matt, Eddie and Alia take care of us in the lounge. The passion and energy to make it a perfect dinning experience. The food. AMAZING. No matter if you get steaks or seafood, even the sides....all executed to perfection. This restaurant can compete with the best!"
4,Redman is a fantastic company and it is easy to work with the people. I appreciate their coordination with each other and with me to make sure I received quality care. Thank you to Paula and Don Redman for taking my concerns into account.
0,"First time in New Orleans, came here for a nightcap, unfortunately found a Rude and lazy bartender"
4,Mike and the staff were all courteous and delivered top notch quality service. Thanks guys!
4,"Like my review of the Gainesville, FL location, this is where you go for fried chicken, sweet ice tea, and any type of sub imaginable.  Nuff said.

*sigh* I miss this place"
4,Came for breakfast after finding on Yelp. Very pleased. Wanted to try the corned beef hash after reading other reviews but they were out (slightly bummed). Opted for the ribeye very good great seasoning. Hash browns were crispy w the same great seasoning. Hubby had the Chicken fried steak which was good as well. Will most def be back. Owner was great too friendly efficient service.
0,"Extremely disappointing.  When arriving for pickup of a takeout meal I was studiously ignored by wait staff for an extended period as I stood next to the ready-to-go order at the front desk.  When I got home, several items were missing.  When we called to ask for an adjustment or credit, we were promised an adjustment on the charge.  There was no adjustment.  The food we did receive was average to good, but we are never ordering here again."
0,"I've gotten slices from here before and they actually aren't bad, but when I called for delivery I had a horrible experience.  

The guy told me they don't deliver past Washington.  I told him I live 1 block past Washington and can walk to his restaurant in less than 10 minutes.  He hung up on me.

I will never buy so much as a stick of gum from here again."
3,Good food! Good service. A little cramped but all in all good place to grab a bite! Some things are a on the pricy side for what's essentially a pizza place.
4,"I might be tipsy while writing this, which is a testament as to the amazing Barcelona. 5-stars. Hands down. Go there. Be square. 

They have 3 and 6 ounce wine pours, and the 3 ounce pours are exactly half the price of the 6 ounce pours. Aka, smaller samples of lots of amazing wine. 

TAPAS. Just try some things. No regrets."
1,"newly built building after they closed the Galleria's location.  they try to be chain upscale, but i'm not a fan.  menu sounds better than it tastes."
3,My husband and I went for the jazz brunch. We were sitting outside to eat in a beautiful atmosphere until it started raining. We were easily led inside and got comfortable in there as well as the jazz band. We had a nice time. The food was good. I expected to see more breakfast items and didn't find any. If we wanted breakfast items they would make omelettes and eggs Benedict but had to ask for them. Other than that is was very nice. I would go back.
0,Anyone that gives these thieves money is an idiot. No prices are marked and one guy quotes me $12 for an item then the guy with the accent and shady aura says $24. Never again.
0,The office cancelled my appointment in August and never rescheduled. I called back and could not gett an appointment until 5 months later. Now I receive a letter that my information in their system was hacked
4,"Well if you haven't been here lately, you need to check it.

They have revamped the whole place.  New entry and retail space.  Also the range is now air conditioned.  Very clean range with awesome employees.  Very knowledgeable and willing to help to make your shooting experience a great one.

They do sell guns and have some ammo.  The range is rented by the hour which is more than enough time to shoot 100 rounds or so.

Only open on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.  Hopefully they will be open more days during the week, soon."
0,"Unfriendly service, greasy food. Only provided 3 napkins. Hush puppies & fried mushrooms were raw/ frozen on the inside.  SKIP THIS PLACE!"
4,Absolutely amazing people! They are all sweet caring people that did an amazing job on my 12 year old golden retriever! Highly recommend!!
3,Super yummy! Food was good! Sat at bar and ate appetizers and ordered the flight of Margaritas! Only thing that sucked was I had to wait 20 minutes for my drinks while she made 4 large quantities of the margaritas to start her evening off. That shoulda been done prior to dinner service otherwise was good
4,Best steak sandwiches in the city even though it's name is roast pork!  roast pork is top notch too!!!
0,I had a terrible experience at Ray Skillman. Made a deal with the sale guy. Told him to only run my credit Thur GM only. If they couldn't get me Thur a deal not to run it Thur any other banks. That I would go to my personal bank and bring them a check back. The sales guy told me 3 times and I ask 3 times don't do it.  GUESS WHAT THEY HIT MY CREDIT 7 times. If I could give it no stars I would.
2,It's Jimmy John's so you know what you're getting. The quality and taste of the food is just fine. If you're ordering delivery while at work... order an hour before you actually want it because the freaky fast delivery is actually freaky slow.
0,"This place only survives because it is in the airport, but otherwise it sucks. The food is better than the complete lack-luster un-attentive and verges on complete rude customer service. Better take it to go."
1,"Made our reservations a month early for hubby's birthday. We were sat at the only 2 topper table in the room.instead of a $6.00 spumoni ice cream birthday treat, they stuck a candle in his meatball, a meatball that every patron receives. Then my steak was medium when I requested med rare. The place was not busy at all. Staff were inattentive and lacked any sort of personality towards us. For a $300 meal, which we frequently enjoy,I give at best 2 stars! And 2 was a stretch! Never again."
4,"The ladies who work at both CP locations are WONDERFUL! They are such pros with children & babies & they're very loving. I don't have family nearby so this has been a life saver + it's very affordable ($10/hr). I feel totally safe leaving my little girl here. We started at 4 months! I rarely leave reviews, but felt strongly about letting other new moms know this place is legit!"
3,"We came here with several friends and had a great night! The band was hilarious and talented, the food was yummy (the wings were a bit too saucy), and the drinks were priced very fair! I suggest it for anyone looking for a good time!"
4,Sexy interior. Best sushi I ever had. The other plated dishes were all delicious. Morimoto does a great job of mixing unique ingredients and making it work for a perfect meal. This restaurant is worth every single penny!!!
2,"For as hyped up as it was I was kind of disappointed. The margarita was good, and the seafood salad was okay. The other person I was with got chicken tacos and she said they were good."
4,Hidden gem. This little join is a definite must. Their menu us huge. Definitely something for everyone. I got the beer battered grouper and it was amazing. The fries were your standard French fry and the slaw was pretty standard as well. Both were good though. The beer selection is pretty decent. The place is clean and has easy parking. The service was spot on too.
3,This place had a great vibe. Taco Tuesday is a must all you can eat tacos for 16.99. I've been here twice and both times I've come away extremely pleased with not only the service but the food.
0,Chicken breast last night-worst chicken I have ever had. It was  Nothing like the other locations which is why I have food poisoning now. NEVER AGAIN !!
4,"Fashion Stitch is small business and they are wonderful! I was worried about going some place that fits the dress for you, then ships it out, then having to wait at least a month to have it back! Fashion Stitch is not like that! I needed a bridesmaid dress fitted, they make them all for tall people and I am far from tall! I called, made the appointment, went in, she was wonderful, she fit it perfectly, had it done in one week and didn't charge me a fortune!! I definitely recommend Fashion Stitch!"
0,"Oh.

sure I may have been naive thinking any cheesesteak from Philly was going to kick ass.

sure I was naive for thinking that it'd be good just because it was one of the forerunners of philly cheesesteaks

sure I regretted not listening to other people say that this place sucks

but you know what? 

I was wrong, and I admit it.  There you go."
0,These people are scumbags. My neighbor's car was about to get towed and he got it and took off. Right after the driver of towing truck decided to chase him on reverse down the block full speed with fork wide open. Hope they get sued soon.
0,"Tried today for lunch had delivered to the job, not very impressed. I ordered the Bumblebee Stew which is described as yellow corn, stewed tomatoes, onions & black beans in a sweet & spicy cream sauce, the flavor was good, but I saw no sauce, mostly rice. I thought it was just me but I also had several other co-workers that were not impressed either with their choices."
4,"This place was amazing! Clearly the best kept secret in stl. The tacos were so flavorful and the drinks were delish, and the staff was so kind and helpful for it to be my first time there. Me and my friend had the Thai beef taco and the jerk chicken taco. Definitely exceeded my expectations and if you decide to go, the fried avocado is a must-try! I will most certainly be coming back to dine soon."
3,Great sandwiches and a charming place to meet friends for a coffee or light breakfast or lunch. The sandwiches are fabulous. The speciality items from other countries gives the perfect opportunity to try new things!
0,"I love MCDs but very disappointed at the service at this location. I went in yesterday to order three fish fillet combos. The associate seemed hostile and rude. He didn't greet me, didn't acknowledge my 10 minutes wait, didn't smile, or thank me at the end of the order. I didn't feel welcome at this location. Later I found a single strand of hair inside my fish sandwich. I have reached out to the manager to report the issue."
0,"Very busy on a Tuesday lunch. Disorganized service. Take out orders are clearly not a priority. Called in my order, was promised 15 minutes, still nothing 30 minutes later. Also incredibly difficult to wave someone down to see if they forgot my order."
3,I have been coming to this location for over 30 years. They never disappoint. Friendly staff! Delicious food! Great value for your money! Easy to order by phone to pickup. Keep up the great cooking and service!!' Thank you for the quality of food and service you provide our community edspecially during these challenging times.
4,"Nice place, nice people, great coffee, and the guy I talked to knew exactly what he was doing --- and didn't act like a complete douchebag."
3,The fresh fish and shrimp where awesome. The beer selection was on point and the staff are so friendly and helpful. Great visit!!
3,"At $18 it's twice as costly to get a car wash here than at one of the car washes at your local gas station but the wash here does a heck of a lot better job at getting the salt off your car. While you're paying a little more, your four wheeled baby is worth it, right?"
3,"I've been here about a half dozen times now for lunch. I find myself getting either a deep dish pizza lunch special or some sort of a toasted sandwich for lunch. 

My favorite though is the personal deep dish lunch special.

It's located in a strip mall with other businesses and a Starbucks, so there is plenty of free parking available."
4,The sushi was delicious. The service was excellent. I would highly recommend this place.
3,"Great lunch spot! My friend and I stopped by for lunch and shared two dishes. Everything was fresh and delicious. Greek salad with avocado was spot on and the dolmas were awesome! Lunch special was a gyro sandwich and fries. 

Staff were friendly, food was tasty and prices were reasonable. I would definitely go back!"
4,I am writing this review for my in laws who are not computer literate.. Jim Logan recently moved my in laws to their new residence in Downingtown.  He showed up with six men and two trucks and was able to complete the entire move under the given written estimate.  The entire moving crew were friendly and professional.
2,"Lovely happy hour with drink specials and some appetizers.
I love the dry run wings! They are very tasty and moist.
Pulled pork sliders are good, but they didn't wow me. Just regular old pork sliders.
Wait staff is nice and I just love the dark decor with lights and a big tree in the middle of the restaurant.
In the summer, they have outdoor seating. There's also a fireplace upstairs in the winter.
Great place to hang out. Never been for dinner, but I'd try it."
4,"SiBelle is wonderful to work with! As first time home buyers, my partner and I were overwhelmed by the complexity of the buying process. SiBelle was an invaluable resource and her help made the process comfortable and easy. She is an excellent communicator, consistently presenting clear and concise information that enabled us to quickly make informed decisions. She was patient with our questions, was always responsive, and was a pleasure to work with. We will be working with her again."
0,"Not one to complain often but I had the worst experience here this afternoon for lunch. I have been a number of time and had fairly good service, but great food. Service was very poor and felt as if I was just another number today but food was still good. Just very disappointing that it felt as if i was being pushed in the entrance and out the exit."
3,"Loved the food. We shared a couple of the ""bites"" and a couple of the tapas. Great atmosphere. Service was lacking but luckily I was with good company. I would definitely go back again."
2,The flatbreads were quite tasty!! Drinks looked good. Half priced apps and some beers during late night and happy hour (5-7). Great for fun late night good eats. Really cool vibe and seating. Service was ok. Parking is available on the street and in nearby lots and garages. Try it out!
4,Small brewery but had some great beer.  My wife and I really liked some of the darker beers.  They had some very high gravity beers.  We are not big into flavored beers but they had a really good tea beer that we both gave high marks.  This was a nice place to hang out a bit off the beaten patch.  Would recommend this place for anybody who likes good beer and not in the main tourist area.
3,"Great Place,   is soon as you walk in the friendly staff make you feel right at home.  The overall Decor is very comforting.  The food is good with several house specialty's.  I'm a big wing guy and I must say their's are very good (however like so many other places nowadays they sell the wings cut into pieces and only give the customer half a wing,  had to take a star off for that.  Utter wise this would have been 5 star place)."
4,"I created this yelp business page in the middle of my pedicure treatment because I was so impressed with the staff (knows customers by name, friendly, interactive) and the quality of the service. I've had pedicures at 5 star spas and the service here was better.

I have never been to the same nail salon twice, but this is my new go to"
4,"Quick and super friendly. Emily was super helpful with our order. The burgers were cooked just right and our order of fries and onion rings were just the right amount of crisp. Overall, this was a great experience."
4,One of the best burgers I've ever had! The bun is made fresh each day. I tried the elk burger with pepper jack cheese. The sweet potato waffle fries with marshmallow dip is a must order!!
4,The BEST hurricanes ever!!! Flew from CA just for these hurricanes and PoBoys from Verte Marte. No lye!!! 4 hr flight for these hurricanes then headed back to Ca
4,Cathy at the rental desk nothing short of amazing. Excellent customer service and will try to always use dollar when I rent thanks to this experience. Thank you!
4,"Excellent food, fun environment.  Daniel our waiter did a phenomenal job and management makes sure everyone is taken care of.  We have been here several times and they are consistantly good."
0,"Overpriced and underwhelming! They have good hummus (hard to mess that up though) and the corn grits are delicious. Other than those two items, the food is subpar. Chewy, dry, over cooked meats flood the menu, the service is slow as molasses, and the pricing is absurd. People seem to like it because it costs so much. I've had better meats at Bud's Broiler though! NOT impressed. Definitely not New Orleans' finest. With so many delicious options in this city, don't waste your time."
4,"My husband was on the search for the perfect Italian hoagie since we moved to South Jersey. No one got it quite right- the way he remembered growing up with Italian grandparents. Then we tried Pal Joey's.

From the bread to the fresh cold cuts and veggies to the perfect sharp cheese and the last sprinkle of herbs and spices - they hit the nail on the head.

Thanks to the great staff, this shop has been open for socially distanced walk in orders. We are thankful for them!!"
4,"The best! Subaru dealership in the Tampa Bay area, hands down. Make sure that if you have any service needs to check in with Brandon Bolden. Brandon is a very knowledgeable and courteous member of the Mastro team and will make your service experiences a great one. 

Check out his page: 
https://www.mastrosubaru.com/brandon.htm"
2,"Although the service staff was very nice and customer service oriented,  I will probably not use them again. Last two visits had longer than 2 hours waiting for simple services."
4,This place is a must!!  We had a great time wine tasting at this place our wine server Gretchen was not only very educated about the vine we were sampling... she was super cool and personable!!
4,"I absolutely love the chocolate raspberry muffin! It is a true dessert for breakfast... okay maybe I should just save it for dessert  my husband has had their cinnamon roll and blueberry muffin and both are really good as well! This is more of a pastry bakery than a breakfast one - the first time we visited we were disappointed they didn't have coffee drink options, but if you know what you're coming for then it's a great place. They always have people picking up orders or coming in for a few treats!"
4,Sunday brunch!  We had the shrimp & grits and vegetable frittata - this was by far the best meal we've had in NOLA!
4,"Dr. Delaune is an extraordinary dentist! I have been traveling for the last year and a half about 70 miles (one way) to see Dr. Delaune.  I have had braces, bonding, and several crowns under his care..  My experience with him has been nothing but satisfaction. His staff goes out of their way to make you comfortable.  They are very professional and very friendly. My husband had extensive dental work done and the results were so beautiful that I switched dentist! I can't say enough about Dr. Delalune. You won't find a more professional, kind person."
3,Great location and options at this KFT (your standard Kung Fu Tea) and drinks taste really good! I can't give a 5/5 though cuz the wait is kinda long and they've gotten my order wrong twice already in the 3 weeks I've gone but it happens! Great boba place.
3,Ive been to Emma's two times and both times we enjoyed ourselves. I went once for a girls night out and the other time was with a large party including children.  The food is very good and the fact that it is BYOB is just great. The whole staff was very friendly and they seem to wait on you as a team instead of just having one server (which some people do not like). The place is very small so I did not mind their serving technique.  We were not rushed at all. Food was paced perfectly. I will be back.
4,"Drove here one evening after work, I thought I was getting a cold and craving Pho. It was SO GOOD! Definitely hit the spot. Spring rolls were a hit too. Fast service and good prices, will definitely be back!"
0,Reviews of this place are scary. Wanted to try it.... We'll pass. Food poisoning more than once mentioned smells?  Wow. Way more bad reviews than good. Sorry
4,"The best and only (to my knowledge) vegan bakery in New Orleans! The live salad, scones, breakfast potatoes with aioli, and the house-made butter (on weekends) are just a few of the wonderful delights. Well-lit and clean, the service personnel are friendly  and knowledgeable. Also available is something I have never seen anywhere in New Orleans or elsewhere: coconut rosemary cookies! Good wifi so also a great place to study with plenty of seating. Breakfast and lunch only so they close mid-afternoon."
3,Nice old rustic philly location right off Rittenhouse. Service was very good and sat in bar area. My wife had the fish and chips and were cooked to perfection. Not greasy or cooked in old oil! I had the steak and it was fantastic! As good as any steak house. Could cut it with a butter knife. Nice beer and wine selection. Would highly recommend this for adults or older children.
1,"Disappointing for brunch. Had reservations but stood in line for quite a while because the staff couldn't seem to figure out what was going on (hostess seemed inexperienced and a bit frantic). Seemed to be a total of two menus for the whole restaurant (they apologized repeatedly for the lack of menus), so tables had to wait to see a menu. Pancakes and huevos were okay, but I found a long hair baked into my pancake, which ended my enjoyment. A comfortable space and a nice location, so was sad not to have a better experience."
0,EVERY SINGLE TIME I order from this particular Five Guys they ALWAYS get my order wrong. I was there two days ago and ordered a Little Bacon Cheeseburger and a Little Cajun Fry. They got it all wrong!!!!!! They did not even put ANY cheese on my burger AND they gave me regular fries. Not to mention in the past every time I would order a Little Bacon Cheeseburger they would NEVER put bacon on it.....I HATE THIS FIVE GUYS!!!!!!
0,"The floor in my room had been littered in tissue, needle wrappers, and caps. The nurses were not personable nor chipper. As im waiting an extensive amount of time for the Dr. To come back a friend had wondered back to see me. Catching me at a bad point. No one gave permission they just walked in... The only reason theres 1 star is bc the Dr. Was at least kind... Grandview is worth the extra 15min drive"
4,"We ordered latte, tea (kind of milk tea, I don't remember though), and key lime cookie there. Everything was good, and the place was nice, quite, and comfortable to stay. And people there were also nice!"
4,Good place for kids to burn off their energy.  Parents can just chill in the massage chair or bring their laptop and get work done with the free wifi.
0,"the Customer service was terrible the Employee that took my order in the drive thru was Jean The Manager of Krispy Kreme, she was really rube and rushing me to order . But the employee at window named Kate was really nice and was really patient."
4,I can't say enough good words about this nail salon! I was in a crunch to get my nails fixed before getting married and I was in and out in an hour with my nails looking fantastic. The salon even cleaned my ring for me!!
4,"Friendly staff, awesome Barista, very helpful staff who I notice tries very hard to remember their customers and what they drink. I have never had an issue with them, and I have been going here several years. I sometimes come to study and it's always very comfortable. Will continue to go here, as long as they are here!!!"
0,"This place is Closed !!!! 

 I decided to try the cheese steak. I drove there to find out they closed up and moved out."
4,This place is amazing. It's a great stop when touring the breweries on bridge street. Plenty of inventory of both newly printed and used vinyls.
4,"been here once for a birthday gift and can't wait to go back!  Staff is friendly and professional, salon is beautiful and spotless!  LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!"
4,Amazing!!! Can't say enough positive things about this place. Definitely need to try when you're in east Nashville. Owner operated. They clearly have an honest passion for their craft. Great atmosphere and delicious food.
4,"This place is a breath of fresh air in Plant City.  A modern concept in our historical town.   Good drinks, yummy snacks and nice people. The evening concerts are also refreshing with an intimate and fun environment.   Thanks for all that you do for PC."
2,"I have been there twice.  The first time was awesome, great food, good service.  The second time left me disappointed.  The bun on my burger was stale and the goat cheese spread was more like soup.  After we had finished eating, no one came back to remove our plates."
1,"Nice plants and related items, but difficult staff and inflated prices. Plenty of other reasonable options in the area with friendly and helpful staff. Save your self the money and headache."
0,I called and reserved a room at about 10 p.m. . Reached  the hotel at about 12am and explained that at reservation time. When I arrived at the hotel they had already given my room to someone else. They refunded the room without contacting me and were not able to provide another hotel referral. This is the most unprofessional place I've ever attempted to stay. I will never ever make a reservation at this establishment again.
4,"AMAZING! This was the greatest experience ever! We came on a mini family vacation with two 4 year olds and they had the time of their life! We all left  with so much knowledge of the Bayou! Our Captain was so knowledgeable. We got to see so many gators! If you are looking for a swap tour book here now you will not be disappointed! communication before the trip was always quick , easy and clear. We can't wait to go back. Thank you for such an amazing experience! I know this will be an experience we will talk about for years."
0,"Really gone down hill, and lies to their customers about what work is done and who is doing it."
0,Is this place ever open???? I tried a few times this summer and they have always been closed.
0,"Worst food I tried, and annoying music and decor were disturbing while eating bad quality food+ it feels like the food is really old"
3,Great food and great service. We didn't have to wait long for our tables. Service was excellent and the food was yummy.  We went there for lunch but kids in casino I know but we got a tables quickly.  We all had a variety of food. It was delicious.
4,Loved it. Food was great. Very cute place. Came for brunch and it was delicious and reasonably priced
3,"This food truck came to my job a couple of days ago. Normally I don't like brick oven Pizza. But it's free food so I'm not going to say no‍. I'm glad I chose to eat it because their Pizza is tasty! it's not too ashy on the bottom(which is why I'm not usually a fan of woofired/brick oven pizza).

 I chose the margherita style and it was delicious! 
My only gripe was that there was too much crust. I would have liked less crust/more sauce."
0,Personnel not helpful. They don't even respect the register lines even though they specifically ask you to stand in line and wait for your turn. We weren't sure when we were going to be able to pay since they kept telling us to go to different registers. Service is also very slow. What happened with the southern hospitality?
0,Food is OK here but last two times we have been here waited over 30 mins for our food and got luke warm obviously forgotten food.  NOT COMING BACK!!!
4,Extraordinary customer service and beautiful flowers. They have never let me down! The owner and the staff always go the extra mile to provide excellent customer service and top quality flower arrangements.  Thank you for being my florist for over 30 years!
2,"The food was good but, the kale is too salty. The crabless cakes were delicious as was the Spanish rice that wasn't rice. The strawberry banana pudding was not good. 1 way too sweet 2 the strawberry appears to be a crushed strawberry ice cream cone (junk food) and 3 there were two pieces of hair in it."
4,"Lafayette Park is a wonderful place to enjoy the Lafayette Square Neighborhood.  Walking around this park gives you views of some of the Painted Ladies flanking the park.  These Victorian Treasures help make the area even more alluring.

Lafayette Park was the first public park in the City of St. Louis.  In fact, many Historians believe Lafayette Park is the oldest urban park West of the Mississippi.  This 30-acre park includes a pond, wildlife, statues, cannons, bridge, a pavilion, playground, picnic benches, and walking paths.

Take time out to enjoy this Historic St. Louis Treasure."
3,Great sandwiches and a relaxed outdoor seating area near the SB Presidio . Pickles are awesome if you like pickles as I do.
4,"My wife and I love this place! From the staff, Atmosphere  &  Food - absolutely,  5 star across the board!  Worth the drive into Philadelphia!  Great date night!"
3,"Not the flashiest or glitziest lounge in Olde City, but if you just want good food, quick service, and strong drinks in a laid back environment, this is the place to go.  They have great happy hour specials as well."
4,Stephen is the best server! Food is great! Also free margerita with check in on yelp.
4,"Been wanting to go & finally got there for lunch today. So delicious & my husband also agreed! The roasted brussel sprouts were crunchy & tasty. Very generous portion too. The crab stuffed portabella with a panko topping was very yummy. As much as I love a good crab cake, I didn't miss it. Great coffee & green smoothie. Need to return since there are many other items I want to try.  Very friendly staff & a cool atmosphere. Highly recommend!!"
4,"Had a great experience here! Great prices and if you call and make an appointment they give you 10% off of your service. They use great products and are very thorough. Mei was such a pleasure to talk to while getting my pedicure and she did a wonderful job! Hot stones, warm towels, oil infused scrubs- I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in town..I'm happy I found a solid nail salon!"
3,"If you want ""fast food"" McDonalds can't be beat! I love the French fries! I see a lot of complaints but I have never had a problem here! It is set up more for drive threw service as the inside is small. I love the Frappe and Quarter Pounder.  It is usually a fast drive threw. There are times of the day when it will be crowded as people are getting lunch. I have never had any problems here. The food has always been hot and the staff is nice."
2,"Restaurant is beautiful on the inside - I was surprised at the beauty of the restaurant for a strip mall location!  Staff is knowledgeable and helpful but slow in bringing food to the table.  Chicken parmigiana is outstanding but the sauce on the side pasta is flavorless and leaves an after taste. I will go back for the chicken parm but I will get veggies or a different side. 
Their wine selection is unbelievable!  A little pricey."
2,"They told me to get there 30 minutes before the movie started. I did, and they made me wait till 15 minutes before the movie started to get in.

I ordered a beer, water, and dinner. I was already done with dinner and I still didn't receive my drinks. I asked her where it was and it came, warm.

The movie was good. The food was sub par..."
1,"Food was fair at best !  I had seafood gumbo it was cold and ok flavor. I was disappointed in our meal 
However, beer was very cold ! Best part of lunch"
0,"My husband walked in 13 minutes before closing tonight, along with 2 other patrons -- and they were told that they're closed!  
Bad business practice!
No one else was there but employees who were starting to turn the lights off, turning business away.
There should be a zero-star option."
2,"Standard Starbucks store. Nothing to stand above, beside great location. On the other side, as I pointed out earlier, more and more stores are lagging in cleanness. This store is one of them. Hope that Starbucks Managment will consider and make some changes in the near future."
4,"I was lucky enough to get an invite to their soft opening last night.  Eccentric and Westbank Special were both great.  Had an issue with one of the waitresses who was definitely lacking in common sense, but the issue was made right and not even worth the complaint.  
Seriously excited that I won't have to go to Magazine or Canal anymore when I get my craving for Theo's."
4,The food the service in the wine was phenomenal. Highly recommend it for a date night out or with a group of friends
1,Ole Bridge Pub has the potential to be a great place.  The location is great and the outdoor seating is really nice.  The service sucks though and the ginger vodka martinis tasted different each time  I tasted them.  The meat head bartenders acted  like making my drink was a burden and they act acted like they hated their jobs.  I would advise skipping this lame as hipster joint and walk to the tap house.  The bartenders don't under pour and they are actually happy to make a drink for you.
3,Open at all ridiculous hours of the night and the Gabacho is the best burrito I've ever had.
3,"Great seafood! I've been coming here for years just for the swordfish. But I was extremely disappointed upon coming here the last time, I was told they no longer have swordfish. So I ordered the Mahi Mahi cooked the same way the swordfish is, and it was delicious. As people have said, the dining area isn't ""pretty"", it just has nautical things hanging up all over, but who cares? It's not a fancy place. The food is good. That is what counts right? BYOB."
4,"Ahhh Chic-Fil-A where good Christians go to get the ""Original Chicken Sandwich"", not the O.G. (Original Gangster) Chicken Sandwich from the ""other place"". I like to order a chicken sandwich from here with a ""My Pleasure"" instead of having to dust off my bullet proof vest to order a Chicken Sandwich from the ""other place"". So be a good Christian and order a Chicken sandwich from here and leave the bullet proof vest at home."
4,Did a great and quick job repairing the zipper on our suitcase. Tony is very nice and helpful. It is a clean neat shop. I am really glad to have found a local Shoemaker in the area and would not hesitate to use them again. They also do custom orthotics and work with orthopedic physicians for shoe inserts so it's truly a full-service destination.
4,"I had a set of 4 new tires installed today. Great price and fast, friendly service!"
2,"Mehhh I had really high expectations for this place. It's essentially a version of pita chip but alittle less vast in options. The place was fine and looked clean but the food itself wasn't that good. It was fresh, but unseasoned. I just didn't capture that flavor I was hoping for. Perhaps pita chip set my expectations too high? I didn't think their hummus was as smooth as it could be as well. I cut some slack and gave three stars because it's pretty new. Hopefully they amo up the flavor sometime soon!"
0,Room was filthy. No amenities. The place had a fire which affected building power so no sports complex no laundry and believe it or not  no ice machine. The fire was 7 months prior to our staying but we were not informed that the main gate and the front desk were closed. Drove around for 5 minutes trying to find check in site. FYI it is the salon.
4,I LOVE homemade ice cream & water ice. The service is great. The next time I go back I would like to try the flavored water. I love the rum raisin and peach ice cream. My favorite water ice is Mango. Just in case you are indecisive you can't go wrong with any of those 3 flavors.
4,"Awesome new little juice/clean eating spot. My wife and I got Açaí bowls (pictured) and they were delicious! Plenty of fresh fruit and toppings. The atmosphere is great as well, very modern and clean. If you are in the area and want a quick refreshing lunch/brunch/whatever then this place will be your jam. 

The Juicerie is the juice for me! (Açaí what I did there?)"
0,"Being from Dartmouth I was very excited about this place.  
Came here a couple times during the day and the food was just like home (5 stars). 
Just left there tonight shortly before 2am to find the place trashed. The person behind the counter was more concerned about the music playing then serving customers.  
No pizza slices and no Donair meat on a spindle. 
Definitely not like the KOD from home."
4,"Incredible customer service.  Took my car in for an oil leak due to a Hyundai recall.  Even though The earliest service appointment was in May, John was able to get my car fixed and back to me within 1 day.  Entire staff was friendly and professional."
1,"Pretty pricey, at $1.49 per topping, but wanted a delivery.  An hour after I ordered I called back to see where it was, but arrived just as I called.  It was barely luke warm.  I called and complained and was offered another pizza sent (I was starving when the first one got here) or a free order of garlic bread next time I ordered.  I told them don't bother because I won't be ordering from them again."
4,Best place to eat Filipino food in Reno! Nothing comes close since Cafe De Manila closed.
3,"I really like this place. The owner and his wife don't say very much, which made me a bit nervous as I was having a bridesmaids dress altered and didn't really get feedback from them. Still, she seemed perfectly confident in what she was doing and, apprehension aside, I left it with them. It was ready for pick-up 4 days later and it turned out perfect!! They did a really great job and for only $27. I have found my tailor =)"
3,"Really great food, just so so service. Not busy when we went, but waiter seemed to forget us too many times."
0,"I purchased pralines at this store and I did not realize that they were expired since June!!! We realized it when we tried them and they madre awful. When we came back to get a refund they would not give it to us. They wanted us to pick other ones, but all were expired and others did not have expiration dates. We had to call the owner to get our money back. They told us at the store they were removing the expired pralines, but I did not see they were removing them. Beware!!!"
0,"Went here based on Yelp review and was highly disappointed. 
Venue:
Dark place,  most of restaurant is close off like for storage or living walk to the bathroom, you'll see.
Food:
Bland, taste less.  there sushi has no sauces of any kind unless you request it, and pay more. Limited menu. The only plus was its cheap, but you certainly get what you pay for."
4,"I booked Santa Barbara Classic Wine Tours for my birthday/girls wine tasting day & couldn't have been happier with the service I received. From start to finish, me & my friends had a fantastic time on our wine tasting tour!! Sherene made sure that we got to our destinations & that we were very well taken care of every place we visited.  I would highly recommend them & their services to anyone & would definitely use them again!!"
3,Went in to get free donuts with our vaccination cards and ending up getting a dozen delicious donuts and a very good caramel iced coffee.
4,"Best bakery in Philadelphia.  Always consistent.  Great to bring to any social gathering.  Lemon pound cake is always good. Most delicious breads in the city, amazing croissants, delicious soups, carry Little Baby's ice-cream. Love all their dips, spreads and salads too. Really can't go wrong with anything from this place!"
4,From the service to the food to the drinks to the dessert not one complaint can I find. Everything was amazing and this is a new to go to place for me. Loved it!!
3,"My wife and I have been here a few times now.  Solid beer rotation, bartenders are friendly and service is good.  The food keeps us coming back, top notch wings and the salads and burgers are so good for the price.  We live down the street and will be going back alot!"
3,"Adding back one star because their management showed cares by commenting my previous review, adding another star for taking customer's suggestion seriously."
4,"Merchants is a cool restaurant in an even cooler building.  This is the first place I went out to dinner when I moved to Nashville!  The atmosphere inside is cool, with giant booths in the front dining room.

The shrimp and grits are delicious!  It was my first time having this signature southern dish.  Cooked just right, the shrimp were big and juicy.  The grits were smooth and not too gritty.

It is in a great location downtown right on Broadway, which is great for a night out on the town.  Dinner followed by bar hopping, Nashville style."
1,"This review is solely on the food and not the bar.  We stopped after working up an appetite after hitting up the Broadway honkey tonks.  Unfortunately the BBQ here didn't live up to the great music we had heard earlier.  We ordered the pulled pork.  The meat was a little too fatty and grizzly for my liking.  The sides were the best part of the meal.  Decent coleslaw and onion rings.     

Tip: try the spicy BBQ sauce."
0,"Horrendous, I thought I was getting a bowl of noodles but instead I got a bowl of fat and greasy red sauce that left an awful aftertaste in my mouth. The quality of the food is terrible and too overpriced. Don't waste your time."
3,The waitress was really sweet to my babies and made them feel really special. I wasn't going to mention the well done steak that was supposed to be medium but she spotted it. She even made a thing of it and went to the manager to get it compensated me. She was very very nice.
4,"Seriously loving how there is another location nearby. I am one who loves Trader Joe's, so if I bring it up in every sentence just beware lol They have such neat food items and great prices. Everyone is super friendly in the two locations I've been here. The parking lot is much much better in the meridian location but I assume the Boise location doesn't have as much traffic, now that the meridian one opened so parking might not be too bad now."
2,Definitely would not recommend any steak entrees . The oyster soufflé is the only item I have had served as soon as cooked and nice and hot at the table. All steak dishes I have had were room temp with nothing special for taste. Definitely a great place for unique fish and shrimp dishes. They pay a good deal of attention to the guests and the musicians are great. Unfortunately every time my main entree is not very hot when served.
0,"Hello James!

I don't know what further details I can provide. I pretty much spelled out exactly what occurred.

Thanks and good luck."
0,I asked for my salad on the side and they proceded to put white sauce and then vinegar on my food instead of hot sauce because i inconvenienced their conversation. The only reason this place is open is because its the only place in philly open 24/7 after quarentine. I called and they laugehed in my face.
2,"I wish I could give them 5 stars because the nurse that came out to pierce my daughter's ears was friendly and did a good job.  However, I must deduct 2 stars based on how unprofessional the owner is.  I had to call her to find out my prior appointment had been canceled (I thought it was supposed to be the other way around).  They also have you schedule a time on the site but still give you a 2 hour window so the time you choose isn't set in stone."
1,"After many years of positive experiences our recent visits have left us bewildered. Took our X5 in for oil change and anti-freeze leak. Car continues to leak after taking it back twice and having paid $1500. Told us today it's a different hose and would be $800. 
We counted on their expertise to know which one was leaking. It appears as though we paid them to change non leaking parts?
Not sure what's happened with them but certainly not the standard of care that we had previously received."
0,"No guest food trays for any family member(not even one). No decent coffee pots, no amenities at all for families who visit or must wait hours for procedures. Surgery check-in has a volunteer working instead of a paid employee. VERY INAPPROPRIATE to have a volunteer working in this type of capacity.  CHEAP SKATE HOSPITAL."
4,Always a good time here. Weds special if meatloaf is amazing and big enough to split! Best wings in town by far and best Moscow mules ever. Bar staff is always entertaining too!!
4,New Orleans' best poboys. I almost always get their roast beef poboy with fries and a Barq's. Their fried seafood poboys are also stellar. Their bartenders are also great and the decor is wonderfully nostalgic. Visiting Parkway to fill up before parades or Voodoo fest is practically a family tradition.
0,The service at this bar is horrible. Everyone who works there is rude and actively avoids customers when they are speaking to them.
4,Could become my new favorite restaurant in Media.  A bunch of friends and I have had a few dinners here and we've spent sometime at their bar.  It's really come a long way in a short amount of time.  The servers are super nice.  Bar tender is fun and very fast.  The food is excellent (they must have a new chef).  I'm planning on trying a Sunday brunch soon since my parents keep telling me how excellent it is.
3,Great local place with some neat pizza combinations.  The Chicken Bacon Ranch pizza is fantastic.  The Mac & Cheese Grilled Cheese is tasty.  Not a huge fan of the giant glob of Mozzarella on the top of the pulled pork mac & cheese though.  Delivery is super smooth and the delivery people are always really nice.  The staff inside the restaurant are also very pleasant.
4,Lindsey saved Christmas for me. Squeezed in a last minute framing job. Lovely shop and she is a pleasure to deal with. You won't be disappointed.
0,"I placed a simple order this morning. Three bacon egg and cheese sliders, three sausage egg and cheese sliders and a large diet Coke. The order was correct on the screen except it said regular Coke, so I had to correct that. I am lucky that I noticed, because I can't handle sugar and would have had to throw a regular Coke out. When I got home, I was very disappointed to see that I had six sausage egg and cheese sliders.  Too much trouble to return them, so just lived with it. I guess I'll go to McDonald's from now on."
4,"I can honestly say that the meal I had here was one of the best I've ever had. I went here for my graduation supper and was lucky enough to experience a custom menu. Everything was perfect, from the sweet pea soup to the fresh halibut. 

I've only ate there once but this is by far one of my most favourite places to eat."
3,On this night I Yelped 'best Mediterranean cuisine' for the Indy suburb I was in. This place has great reviews and now I understand why. The food I ordered was fabulously fresh and delicious.
3,love the food and the landscape. Sweet potaro fries are awesome. The only thing a little bit 'disgusting' is the sauce pots
2,$2.00 slices for lunch. Can't beat the price. Crust is crunchy. Italian sausage could be a little spicier. People are friendly. Quick stop on Route 77.
4,"Had dinner here Sunday night and had a great experience. Sat with Alanis, she took great care of me and my friends! Food was delicious and the drinks were ice cold. She has an awesome personality, I will definitely be back there to see her!!"
2,Maybe it was an off night but found the food average. Onion rings were horrible. Tried the tenderloin and it was average. Shake ok. Friend ordered malt and tasted like a shake. To be fair my dad will drive an hour to get a cheeseburger from here so next time I'll order the cheeseburger.
2,"It was ok but pricey.  Avoid the home fries which are weird little spongy potato cubes.  This is also not a place that feeds you, the two of us ordered 3 breakfasts.  Which we never have done that before.  Her eggs looked and tasted like buffet eggs.  I ordered eggs Benedict.  They were tasty but no potatoes.  One nice thing is the gluten free options are extensive compared to most restaurants.  Not a place I would rush back but, it was ok."
4,The best brisket I've ever had! My wife and I came here for a late lunch and had a nice surprise! Everything was excellent! The brisket was super tender and hardly had any fat on it! All of the sides were absolutely delicious from the collared greens to the corn bread. Would definitely recommend!
4,"The best pho I have yet had. 

There was something different about the broth that I have not yet experienced with any pho in Sacramento and I've tried SEVERAL.

Which makes me all the more sad that I DO live in Sacramento. Thanks, St. Louis. You'll always hold the pho-place in my heart."
1,"Good service overshadowed by so-so quality food.    

Service was very good, polite and timely.  Drinks good as well.  Cherry butter was not-so-good. Brandy Burger was overcooked and tasteless.  Scallops Diablo had only three scallops and was far from 'diablo'.

Would go back for drinks, but maybe not dinner."
4,We never have a bad meal here! My favorite are the sygoons and any menu item with the sybergs sauce on it! The wait staff is always extremely nice as well! Definitely one of our favorite restaurants!
4,"Great service replacing battery on my old IPod Classic, fast and friendly.  Five-Stars for sure."
4,"super unsociable chick running the front of house.

Bad day or not, handle your biz.

food rocks!"
3,"This is a case of you get what you pay for, we tried a number of dishes and everything was perfectly cooked and original. This place is definitely for the adventurous pallet but you won't find more interesting meals or a larger selection of spirits and beer in the city. It is a tad small though : )"
3,"Acme is a classic Nashville venue. It has an amazing rooftop patio where you can grab a drink and look at the Cumberland river, Titan's stadium and all down Broadway. They have a wide variety of drinks-mixed drinks, canned, and draft beers. Sunday Funday is always a good time at Acme-and you can hop around to the many other attractions of downtown since they are so close. Be sure to Uber!"
4,Siiiiiii siempre voy a este lugar con mis amigos para darles una buena experiencia!  This place has wonderful baleadas (a typical food from Honduras where my mom is from) and they also have good pupusas and horchata!  The staff treat us great every time. Each time I come they know how to make me happy and are always doing little things to add to the experience--whether it's for me or the guests I bring. I saw they will be selling paletas there soon too.
4,We took our Axle there yesterday Dr Maloney and his staff were amazing and friendly.  Highly recommend them
4,"This is a good Mexican restaurant, clean, good food and great service. Prices are fair and some dishes are exceptional like the Mazatlan Seafood Salad, Ceaser Salad, Carne Asada Rib Eye steak and the Fish dishes.  I highly recommend this restaurant.  I go there few times a year when I travel to Reno/ Sparks area for business."
4,"Fantastic food, good drinks, reasonably priced for the quality. All of the upgrades have improved the experience massively. The parking lot is convenient and the new bathrooms are well placed and thought out. I can't wait to see what they do next!"
4,"The tour was well worth the money! The night tour was fun and romantic. People were very friendly and kind as we went around. Tom was excellent, very knowledgeable and kind.  I would recommend asking for Tom and Luke (his horse) for your tour. He kept us safe moving in and out of the streets. He has been doing this tour for a long time!  It showed in his knowledge of the area. 

Thank you Tom for a wonderful experience!"
4,I had a great experience with these folks. My rep was very knowledgeable and even gave me a nearly brand new car (less than 1K miles) even though I was returning it to Orlando. Service was fast and she even gave me a few tips on great places to see/eat while I was there. I was completely satisfied all around!
1,"Very expensive.  I prefer Panera Bread but it was good for what you got.  

Kinda miffed that I didn't get my carrots and when I asked about it, they said that they ran out....  But then the next people to get their order got carrots?  The waitress walked right by me with the carrots on the plate.

What was that about?

Definitely not going back."
4,I have worked for Courtesy Hyundai for about 5 months now. It has been my most favorite job now career. The management team is very helpful and they truly care about the customers and the associates. We have a family here and it is called the movement. I would recommend this dealership to anyone and everyone. So come on down and see us at Courtesy Hyundai of Tampa
3,"I think McDonald's coffee is great--reasonably priced and available everywhere.  With the McDonald's app, I paid just a buck even at this airport location.  The service was efficient.  You'll do much better spending your money here than at the slots in the Reno airport!"
1,"We felt like we were in the Tenderloin but wouldn't have cared if the food was good. This is not New York pizza. The crust is too thick and tough and it's too goopy, not the proper balance of cheese,sauce and crust. The table was greasy and had crumbs on it."
4,Fantastic dinner out with my wonderful wife. Atmosphere was perfect especially with a delightful piano playing nearby. Food was great we enjoyed the the shrimp cocktail appetizer. We will definitely be back but maybe we'll try sitting out on the terrace to appreciate the beautiful AZ sunset.
4,"Best Venezuelan food since I left Caracas. The only thing is that the restaurant is so small, but omg it was amazing. Great food."
1,"We ate here a second time because it was close to where we were and they had an after game deal for our little leaguers.  The salads were good, but the food isn't anything to write home about.  Server was indifferent. Pasta House is much better, if that says anything."
0,"Guess this place is ONLY for the young People as I read all the other comments, they talk about the decor and the bar! I guess if I spent enough money to get tipsy I would of liked the place also!! Still I find them expensive!!!!"
0,Been here before. Food and service were 3 star. I only went back because of a gift card. They are not accepting gift cards in spite of continuing to sell them. When I asked why the server mumbled out a few excuses that didn't make sense nor know if when they would be honored. I think it is for all Baileys Restaurants. They must be desperate to do that.
4,"I love Starbucks in general, but I particularly like this one.  Mel is knowledgeable about products and externally helpful.  She is a pleasure! 

My only complaint is the small parking lot and narrow drive thru, but it doesn't stop us from going there."
0,"Food is nasty and the service is poor, food is always cold and never made right avoid at all costs!!"
4,"Delicious and I have enough left over for dinner. I had Oxtails , yellow rice and cabbage. My friend had fried chicken, Mac and cheese , and potato salad! All very good!"
4,Amazing drinks - full of personality and just a great spot for Whiskey enthusiasts and people trying to get over a rough time.
4,"This place is fantastic. Delicious food, beautiful outdoor seating, great service, reasonable prices, and a slice of cake the size of my daughter's head. I found my new favorite spot."
3,"Bobbys Burgers is a great addition to the University City area scene for a good lunch or dinner. Their servers are always kind and enthusiastic. While it is a little pricey, the food is always delicious. May want to avoid it when it is super crowded though, because it can take a while for your food when it's packed.

I usually like to go with the Buffalo burger w/ provolone. One good tip: always order your burger a little more well done than you would like it... their scale seems to lean a little on the rare side."
0,New owners. Nice as could be. But as he bragged about his great food and excellent service we were totally ignored by his bartender. And she seemed annoyed that he was talking to us because he was in her way. Food was okay but the bartender left a bad taste in my mouth. Good luck to the 25th owner.
0,They're closed today for whatever reason even though online it says open and there were no signs and a drive thru line wrapped around the building that we all had to slowly figure out. No sign on drive thru at all indicating they're closed
0,"The downtown location left me cold, literally. Went on New Years Day and the basement was freezing. Service was mediocre. Even commented on how they didn't want to be there due to their long night. Freshness was lacking. My rolls were sloppy and falling apart. Flavor was as mediocre as everything else. Won't go back. 

Having said that, I have had the exact opposite experience of their bar at Lulus Pizza."
1,"This OG was on Rt 38 in Cherry Hill, NJ not Philadelphia!"
4,"I had a caramel cookie ice cream in a hazelnut chocolate cone. Definitely some of the best ice cream I've ever had! A little pricy, but worth it! I want to come again and bring my boyfriend so he can try. He loves the Lightning and there is a Bolts cone."
3,"When we visit my grandma in the West Bank and are craving some Viet food- we come here. On this visit we were conflicted on whether to order family style (com phan) or the grilled beef that you cook and roll at the table. We did both. 

Everything was delicious and satisfied our craving. Food comes out quickly. We also had the sweet and sour fish soup, shaken beef, a veggie plate and pork chops. 

Family friendly place. Easy and good food."
0,"I thought this place looked like a good option at the airport. But I was wrong. The Caesar salad had wet, previously frozen lettuce and the cheese had no taste. The hummus veggie sandwich was soggy and it 0 flavor. Stick with prepackaged snacks like jerky. This place wasn't worth 30 bucks."
3,"I recently went here with a girl-friend and had an awesome night of wine and sushi! 

We ordered a bunch of rolls, wakame and sunomono salads. SO GOOD! Our waiter was super friendly and informative about the menu.

Now, we did have to wait maybe 20 minutes for a table because they didn't have any more menus, I think there were quite a few large parties that had recently came in. It was worth the wait.

Can't wait to go back!"
4,Shrimp Fajitas are the best I've had in the new orleans area and the staff is very friendly. Carolina G is a great waitress and a beautiful smile. I'll be back again.!!!
1,"We wanted to like this place as it is a block from our house, but the pedicures are not great. The massage is done without much care, and the paint job was sloppy. The place is very clean and the decor is nice."
0,"Walked in to get coffee, noticed about 10 customers in the small store, all at the counter or around it, none-- not one!-- wearing a mask. Maybe Franklin is just so dang cool it's immune to Covid. Didn't stick around to find out."
1,"Customers are required to wear masks, but out of the three employees I saw none had masks including the cashier."
4,I am usually not a big fan of pizza Hut. But this location serves really great pizzas. All the toppings were fresh and tasted great. $14 for 2 medium size pizzas(any number of toppings) is not bad at all. Way way better than $12 for 2 medium 2 toppings pizzas that dominoes offers. Totally worth the 2 extra bucks.
0,"Woowwww totally underwhelmed.  Brought my daughter and a friend to have a good time right before Christmas.  What we encountered was rude employees, the longest lines and just the sense that no one cares.  A security guard actually called my son a ""punk a$$ b---"" as we drove out of the self parking lot.  An employee at the gingerbread decorating room was so rude that I had to talk to a manager.  Not the experience I expected."
4,"This airport is one of the BEST in country, from the TSA Agents, ground crews, police, facility management, cleaning crew, and so on. It's very clean l, well organized and top notch customer service. Thank you TIA for making traveling fun again and enjoyable, you guys are the best!"
4,"This is a young relaxed cafe, with a really great atmosphere. Went here for brunch on a Sunday morning, and there was a long line but it went quickly and was worth the wait. The food was delicious, I had the Satsuma Cuban which I highly recommend for those who love pork. They also make freshly squeezed juice and you can choose the ingredients."
4,Love this place. Always have a great experience coming in. The staff is always friendly and ready to answer any questions that you might have. The selection of empanadas is wonderful and they're all delicious.
1,Amazing venue for a wedding. Food and Bev were on point. Excellent service and great chow by the chef. Problem was the DJ. He was....let me see how I put this.....a DOUCHE. My father asked for certain music because the family had practiced dances for the wedding. We choreographed a fun wedding dance and he kept saying he would play the music but never did. I asked him 3 times. I should have just kicked him out and used my ipad. Too bad a wedding experience got ruined by a long hair hippy douche dj.
1,"So overrated... Burger was decent, but small (not much bigger than a slider). Float was lame, very little ice cream. Large fountain drink was $3.09; everything was overpriced. Really disappointed after a bunch of hype."
4,We always enjoy ourselves at Cavanaugh's especially when Jake is bartending. He is a great mixologist that can make you laugh. Make sure you stop by for a good time!
4,"It is clear to me, this dealership appreciates their client base. I had a problem and they worked hard to address my concerns."
4,Our daughter was married last October and we were so fortunate that we had the opportunity to have Jess from We are Wildflowers create the floral arrangements for the big day! She really captured the vibe of the wedding beautifully through her use of unique and stunning florals and greenery. We had so many people comment on how beautiful the flowers were. She is a talented artist who creates such a magical environment for the wedding. I highly recommend Jess and her team if you're looking for something beyond the average wedding flowers!
4,"We hosted a night event here, everyone had a great time. The beer lines were never terribly long and the beer was fantastic."
4,"great new restaurant for a quick bite! We here for lunch today and LOVED IT. Super affordable with a diverse menu of simple plates. I had the turkey crepe - phenomenal! Also I had the triple berry smoothie, super yummy and not heavy and processed junk (14$ for all that!) Service was fast and the owner is very kind!! Highly recommend, killer spot right down the block from Whole Foods on Callowhill. Open all day long (7AM-7PM), so great hours too!"
3,Nice place for a group who likes to play golf. It's a bit pricey and the good is not great but if you are looking for something to do in Tampa and relax with friends go check this place out.
3,"Pizza.

I have started to go to the landing during the day more and now am sure this pizza is addicitive.   I have ordered this at 2 to sober up, but now I must admit I think it is better when I am sober."
1,The taste is a little too bland for my palette and the waiter kept annoying us with random anecdotes when we were trying to have a nice quiet dinner
0,"Came in and were instructed to use the kiosk to order. ONLY the kiosk, no ordering at the counter. Kiosk would be fine if it worked properly and quickly. As we were entering our order, looked over and there was the same person TAKING ORDERS AT THE COUNTER! We could have had our food by the time those people in line even got inside if she had taken our orders instead. Very frustrating to not have the choice of how to order."
1,"Stopped by with friends on a Friday the place wasn't that packed but service was extremely slow, ordered a veggie burger and my stomach was sick for a good 24 hours."
3,"Our waiter was great, excellent service!
Restaurant is nice.
Chicken n Waffles Platter was Huge and the presentation was on point. The Nashville Chicken was very spicy but good. Regular Chicken was good too
The waffles had bacon in it which was different but they were a little dry.
The Fried Green Tomatoes Stack was different w the Chicken Salad in between layers also very nice presentation.
The Deviled eggs were not good and very rubbery! But the Candied bacon was good!"
4,"I had a truly amazing experience with the 3 man team with ""two men and a truck!"" I've seen the trucks all over and I see why now, they are awesome! Hard working, very careful, extremely patient and on time! Thank you so much! We really appreciate the experience, made moving a lot more tolerable."
4,"Honestly, the oysters were absolutely out of this world. And the food wasn't even the best part. Casey and Mikey  - the two adorable male bartenders in the front are the life of the party. It might be a wait for things but it's well worth it."
2,"The coffee and the sausage biscuit I ordered were both very tasty. They were also both expensive. It is quality coffee, so I excused that one, but my sausage biscuit alone was $8+ tax. Altogether coffee + biscuit+ tip ended up being around $15 unfortunately. They have a unique thing going, I just wish they could get their costs down a little. :("
1,"I absolutely love barbecue. This to me is a clearance Salt and Smoke. I got the pork platter with Mac and cheese and the pulled pork turnovers. Meat-unflavorful, BBQ sauces- mediocre, Mac and cheese- dreadful. Turnovers- no taste of Gouda as described on the menu-these were decent but not GREAT. Super unimpressed. Won't be returning. Going back to my Salt and Smoke lover"
4,Came to get my tires rotated. They offered to put my new hubcaps I bought from Amazon on for free!! There wasn't a long wait: 30-45 min on a Friday. The staff was super nice and friendly.
1,Had some fritters here which were hard like a rock and were told that's how it should be. The plates served in were filthy. Staff is unfriendly and not open for feedback. Felt like this place might shut down soon.
0,"You see that manager wrote ""Oh we're sorry just call us and we'll help you""? I called them 4-5 times, left msg.s every time. They never got back to me. Dear(!) Lithia Reno Subaru manager, please don't bother commenting here and trying to look nice. I read other reviews since I posted mine, you didn't do any better even a tiny bit. Subaru name should be ashamed for working with people like you over there!"
0,"Missing items, a big crew in the back just looking lost. Cant see why its possible to miss a customers item having many people back there. Guessing they other reviews were right and they do have the brain of a child."
4,This newer place in Soho was delicious! We had the bowls and chips and they were fresh and tasted great. The service was very friendly and they even brought it out water for our dog. We will go back!
0,"Please listen to all the reviews here - particularly is they say don't use Pack and Load services. Our experience was just awful in a recent move with a POD. The team they sent out had absolutely no experience and so much of our furniture is damaged after the move from Philly to LA. It's actually shameful that PODS recommends them as one of the pack and load services on their website. Just avoid at all cost, we are now trying to work through the insurance claim which is also painful."
1,"VIOLATES TAX LAWS. I bought a sandwich. They charged, along with the regular sales tax, a tourism tax. According to the city's site, ""This tax is a business license tax, not a sales tax."" So, not only do they have meager sandwiches, they violate the law and you pay."
4,All of the food is great but the fried green beans are my favorite! Super great atmosphere and the staff is very nice and welcoming. Great for a social night with friends!!
2,It was OK here. Ive had better food. The staff did a great job. I'm sure I'll give it another shot one day.
4,I love that East Side Bahn Mi has such a variety of vegan options. The Impossible Xiu Mai is spot on with flavors and textures. Adding this East Nashville option to my list of vegan gems for a hearty and flavor packed meal.
4,"Not only is the food here amazing, but the service and the owners are as well.  Where to start...
Maybe with the ceviche.... it was amazing.  I took it home to my husband and ate it for lunch the next day.  It is easy to see that everything here is homemade right down to the tortillas, and it shows in the look and the taste.  I highly recommend checking this place out as soon as you can."
2,"For the second time our togo orders have been wrong. The first time we were told its the fault of so many ""grubhub"" orders- not sure how this impacts a correct order. Today I leave with two $20 salads with fried chicken and neither had chicken. I love the place, but I don't believe the customer should have to adjust to the impact of home delivery, especially when we're ordering drinks while we wait."
4,"Great place! I went to one in Tennessee, and we found one here in Tampa. Great waiter, great food, and great wait time. As you'll see in the pictures, we totally over ordered for 3 people, but didn't even mind because the food was so good that we would have left overs. 10/10 recommend! Awesome decorations and atmosphere as well."
1,"Its on my way to work. The service blows, the deserts are always dry and crappy. 

Why do I stop here? Because its not a gas station. Because I commute 50 miles one way a day and it gives me a chance to get out of the car."
4,"My aunt asked me to find a great brunch spot for 6 people and this was it! While they didn't take reservations, they did seat us right away. We had an amazing waitress- Liz Ann who was very friendly, and on it! The food we ordered was delcioussssss! I had the cowboy egg wrap with potato pancakes. My friend had French toast and it was also amazing. We topped it off w a cinnamon roll and it was sooo good- get it grilled. Yum 5 stars!"
3,"Our family of six had a nice time at the FI. We paid the normal admission price, but did not pay for any of the many extra things you can do. My kids skew a little older than the target audience at 17, 16, 14, and 10... but the exhibits were fun to do together. Highlights included: the planetarium video 'Dark Universe', the train exhibit, sir isaac newton's loft. Overall, worth a visit, did not blow us away."
3,"If you got the free giant sub coupon in the mail, use it. Then come back to this great sub shop.  Meat and cheeses sliced to order, fresh baked bread and crisp veggies in this truly huge hoagie. 
The staff is friendly and very helpful. I will definitely return."
4,"Great atmosphere.  Lots of beers on tap.   I've only been in town for the weekend, but it's the only bar I've found that cares about good beer."
4,I like going to this location for My eye care. The staff was courteous efficient and very helpful. Also I like this location it is very close to home. This has been my eye care place for the last couple of years.
3,"Had the standard high quality meal at the crossing when in town recenty.  Elected for one of the tasting menus where I had the duck, the pasta, and tiramisu.  All of the items were well prepared and tasty. 

All in all the attention to detail and variety of choices on the tasting menu make this a solid (though not always spectacular) choice in st louis"
0,"We already know that Target employees don't have the best reputation when it comes to providing the Funko Pop exclusives to their customers. They do not care for the collectors at all. Inventory shows this store has these items in stock and the employees just can't seem to ""find"" in the back. It's always one excuse after another. Don't know if they're being truthful, but after waiting for an hour after an hour, I realize they just don't care...SMH"
4,"Authentic Louisiana food for a great price! The servers were welcoming, kind and attentive. The food was delicious! Pictures is the spicy jambalaya which is a Friday special. Also highly recommend the sangria!"
4,Best coffe great atmosphere and the friendliest employees
4,"Such a great museum for such a small state. We were staying in nearby Philly for a work conference and decided to take advantage of the museum on one of our free afternoons, and boy am I glad we did! The interior is so modern and sparkling clean and the cafe and gift shop are great as well."
4,"I can't stress enough how much a genius Nicole J. Is with hair. I trust her so much! I literally go in and just tell her do whatever she wants with my cut and colors! Also, Ammo is doing temp checks upon entry and limited appointments so that def makes me feel more comfortable during covid haircuts. Thaks again Nicole J"
4,Excelente sabor con el toque auténtico. It is a small place off of Ulmerton Rd but very familiar and best of all great food.
4,Totally delicious and worth the wait! Great small bar known for their burgers and duck fat fries. They have a great selection of seasonal pickled items. We had the turnips with black kale and also the beets. Make sure to try some of their specialty drinks! Everything is always a great experience when we come here!!
4,"absolutely love the ""graham crackers in milk"" flavored froyo, amazing work."
4,"Good , excellent service perfect food, thanks for everything, I love the place, I'll see you soon"
4,"All I can say is AMAZING!!!!!! The food was delish and meeting Aaron Sanchez was the cherry on top! The service is great and the music, oh the music is GREAT!! I ordered the pork torta with eggs and it was the most perfect poached egg! The torta was delish and the fried plantains with the salsa was awesome! My son loved his asada tacos and the Mexican street corn is to die for!! Totally worth the price!!!"
0,"I arrived to my hotel room and first thing I come into from a long days drive is a room that is filthy and covered in white stains on the lounge chair, a floor that needs to be vacuumed and a dirty night stand counter. I'm starting to wonder if they even washed the bed sheets. Definitely not a good first impression."
3,"The staff was super nice and inviting, the food was reasonably priced (and it was pretty darn good and filling). My only critique was that my everything bagel was a little saltier than I'm used to. But it was still super tasty!"
4,Love this place. Everything looked delicious; hard to decide what to get. I went with the wherever spaghetti as I've been craving it for 5 years. It really hit the spot. So good.
1,It's just bland and below average. Nothing flavorful here. I get the concept but I had better like Choolah to compare. This place doesn't make the cut. Even I tried it ... just blahhhh
0,"The smog inspection portion of this business is dishonest operation, especially when it comes to senior citizens. I was very specific in stating I did not want the facility to do the car registration for an additional fee. When I went to pay they had done the registration which I disputed. The totally dishonest manager kept saying because I gave him my credit card I thereby authorized him to complete the registration. This is a total falsehood. While the fee is not large the nefarious way this business operates should make everyone think twice about dealing with them."
3,great place for learning and healing alike...its not a 5 star hotel  but gets the job done.. has gone through Renaissance of sorts in taking on Drexel and trying to move away from the tenent name..
3,"Bourbon Street Love was phenomenal! Waiting area, both inside and outside was a bit sketchy but the food made up for it."
4,I love the ambience of this hotel. The outside reminds me of the castles in Ireland. I have a thing for clock towers as the one in Boston was right by our apartment. Anywhere I was I just looked to the clock tower to get home. I stayed in the clock tower! The Christmas decor and atmosphere is phenomenal. My co-worker had a Christmas tree in his room. I fly in and out of St. Louis all the time and the metro goes right there. I will be back!
3,I had a good experience at Ortho Mattress because of their manager Carmen. She helped me with my every need and concern and even went the extra step to fix my order that got messed up to ease my stress. She was so kind and welcoming on the phone as well which convinced me to go to Ortho Mattress in the first place. All around great experience and customer service and made my upcoming move easier.
4,"If you are a vegan, go here, even if you're not, go here. Fast service, great food.

The vegan cheesesteak is unbelievable, it's delicious. The seitan wings and cheese fries are divine. I wish I could eat here for every meal."
3,"The food was very good, and the service was very good. The wait time was horrible 45 minutes for a table, and another 30 minutes for the food. I would recommend this place but not every weekend. I would give 5 stars except for the wait times. But I don't blame them. It's a good sign of a restaurant is busy."
4,Staff is always extremely helpful and genuinely friendly.   Plus it's always gorgeous girls behind the counter.   Hit this place up you won't be sorry.
0,Worst meal ever. I got the mango chicken and it had no flavor at all. I don't know if it was missing sauce but it was almost inedible.
4,Texas Roadhouse is nice!!! Their bread is to die for! But they got my mom's order wrong by adding cream to her sweet potato. And every time we ran out of something they would bring an extra :( Like they brought me an extra ice tea and extra bread as an default appetizer. But the staff were very helpful like our waitress Kimber guided us through the menu which was very helpful. And even a ballon master came and made my child a ballon ! Which was extremely kind!
0,This used to be one of me and my girlfriend's favorite Sunday morning breakfast spots.  We often grabbed lunch take out from here too.  Their food is great but this all ended this past Sunday when a big brown mouse ran across my girlfriend's foot and up to the hostess station.  I hope this was just a fluke occurrence but sadly this place is now ruined for us.
1,Food and service have gone way down hill sinceReally sad to see this place settle into mediocrity.
0,Went last week and it was awful! The place is bad and they don't use fresh food!!! Looked in the trash on the parking lot when i left!!! Won't return and won't recommend!
2,"As I prepare to do some reviews on yelp this week, I had a lawn care treatment this week that went great. I asked the tech to hit some weed prone spots on the hill behind our pool that are hard to hit on the rider thing they use. He hit the spits with a hose that is attached to the rider. Very pleased with the service."
3,"Cute little neighborhood cafe, we set outside and it was pleasant and quiet. Super nice waitress and service. Ate their house burger which was the special due to them celebrating an anniversary, and it came with both salad and fries! With many other options around this little gem should be visited, a local recommended it to us and we were not disappointed!"
0,Dummies..terrible service..Got my order wrong..Perfect job for u.Maybe in 5 years you can move up to fries..Its Dirty too
0,This place is over priced and food is only decent. Spend your money at nearby staple Jackimos or Boucherie.
2,I am regular here. Front cash register staff are friendly.  Guys making your food not as much. I love Panera in general though as I feel like I am able to get healthy good quickly on the go. I am getting to the point where it is getting harder to tolerate fast food as delicious as it may be sometimes!  Getting old ain't no joke.
2,"The Brass Monkey was located a short walk from my hotel in Pass a Grille, FL. It's on the second floor across the street from the beach, the view is as nice as anywhere in the area and the food was pretty solid.

The service was a bit slow and the menu is a little overwhelming but our orders came out just as we asked and the sandwiches we picked were basic but just what we wanted to soak up the Coronas we ordered with lunch"
4,"This place is delicious! The food is different without a pretentious flare of being different. They used to have one of the best chicken tacos in town and took it off the menu. Wtf? That was one of our main reasons for, well every return visit, after our first experience! Come on Americanos we need that taco!
The bartenders are awesome!"
4,"I'm assuming this place was recently remodeled. Room was very nice and spacious. Breakfast was great plenty of options for everyone. The exercise room is basic but I mean it's a hotel. Staff was very kind and helpful. It's right by the train so it's a quick commute to the city. Overall, I was very pleased with my stay here."
3,"Excellent brisket and smoked turkey sandwiches. Sometimes meat can be so dry but this wasn't at all!  Unfortunately they were out of onion rings which I really wanted to try so I got the baked beans. Good but not my favorites.  Anyway, I would definitely recommend this place!  Fast, friendly staff too!  Note that we're picky since we're from Kansas City where we have lots of excellent BBQ."
4,great atmosphere.  Lovely little cafe.  I had the special crab cake egg benefit.   I personally not a big fan of fried items but they did a pretty good job
4,I was surprised by the bad reviews. I love impossible burger and the two dollar cheddar is worth it because it's really good cheese. My friend had the chicken in waffle cone and liked it. It is expensive but spruce street harbor park has expensive food only.
2,"Like everyone, I must agree that the chicken here is amazing. Try going on a night that's not busy, for your chicken not only will take longer than usual but they rush the process of making them too. Meaning the glaze on the chicken will be partially dipped as oppose to being fully dipped :)

Pretty pricey for the location it's in, $20 will get you 20 wings. I love the mussel soup they have, it's spicy yet very fulfilling! Service isn't bad, they can use some improvement. Try it!"
4,"They had the lowest price. Their installers were very cooperative with the specifics of how I wanted the air handler installed. Friendly, professional workmen. Gave good service after the install. (Came back and made some minor adjustments.) Manager went out of his way to get us the emblem showing the model number. Topnotch all around."
3,"this place is great, in the heart of Philly. Great beer and food what more can you ask. You must try the seitan sandwich, it is crazy good! I had the a fish meal, but I was starring at my boyfriends meal the whole time. I took on bite of his and wanted to trade! Great place and in walking distance to all these cute shops. A must go, if you go to visit Philly!"
3,"Tasty food, fair prices, fresh authentic Mexican food. I will visit again. I tried Sesina tacos and al pastor. Delicious, didn't disappoint. I have traveled all over United States and I have tried many Mexicans restaurants. This is definitely one that I will visiting more oftenz"
1,"The food is absolutely delicious, but the girl who was putting toppings and wrapping subs was also running the cash register (while wearing the same gloves!!!). I wish I had noticed this before I ordered.  I would have asked her to put on clean gloves before touching my toppings."
0,"First of all, we were waiting in line and a guy offered us a ""fast pass"" to go straight inside. Turns out this ""fast pass"" was $20. When we went in we ordered 4 kamikaze shots and the total was $48!!! These shots aren't worth the $3 you pay at a normal bar. The bartender didn't care to tell us the outrageous pricing before making the drinks or swiping the card. Never will go back, nor the other 20 people walking out with us complaining of no AC and high cost drinks. This place is a no go."
4,"This is our go to Chinese restaurant at work. The restaurant is small but is cleanly. I have never sat in for lunch but it never seems too busy. Ordering on the phone is easy and they usually have the food ready for pick up. 

I typically get the general tso chicken lunch special and it is delicious. Just the right amount of spice, chicken and rice. I have also had the California sushi lunch special :) I will continue eating here and would recommend it to others!"
3,"In my opinion one of the best restaurant in town. 
Some dishes change on a regular basis = They keep it interesting
The staff is knowledgeable and passionate on what they do.

Interesting dishes salads. Last time I had a vegetarian ravioli. It was fresh and super delicious!

* its packed during weekends so be ready to wait! or get there early"
1,"The food was excellent, but the service was terrible. Appeared that staff was having fun in the upstairs room. Left us alone in the restaurant. Waited a looooong time for entree to arrive. No one came and asked if we wanted desert, etc. Finally had to go find someone in order to pay."
3,"I like small airports. Makes it easy to get in and out. 

It has a Spanish style decor and was very clean. It's very small so no need to rush to get to where you need to in time. It's really tiny :) 

Staff was all very nice and kind. I'm pregnant and need to opt of security screening and this airport was super fast with providing someone to quickly pat me down."
3,"Great burger and fries. Love that the fries are fried in olive oil, it makes me feel less guilty. Service is excellent, the people are super nice!"
3,The staff here is always so nice. And I always enjoy a Jersey mike sub any dayyyy. The veggie is the only one I get yummm
4,"Coming back for sure! Good seafood, good service and good drinks! A bit pricey but I expected that with seafood and cajun. So good!! The bisque is so good! We had the lobster alfredo and bf had fish n chips. All so good!!"
1,"Went here on a recommendation from a friend. Wasn't really impressed. The service seemed to be okay; however, the food was mediocre."
0,"We went in to buy a Puff Bar. The first one had completely leaked out into the packaging. We went back and were told we could exchange for another one, which was kind as they said they usually do not do this since we left the property. Then... the second one had absolutely no flavor and died within an hour.  Not sure if it was a bad coincidence or what happened but disappointed."
4,"Great location! The station is still perfectly intact as if you are stepping right back in time. You get to see and understand the seriousness of nuclear weaponry. The engineering, math, science and technology all play an important roll in the building itself. The sheer size of the missile is hard to grasp especially standing directly above it. I'd recommend going during the cooler months as we got dehydrated and overheated pretty fast."
4,Beef tenderloin sandwich is awesome.  Food came out quick and hot and just great quality and taste.  This restaurant offers the area a little variety.  I highly recommend it.
2,Great spot for a quick breakfast or lunch. The eggs Benedict were great!!!  Ask for your potatoes well done because they come out a bit undercooked.
4,"Got some sweaters, one top and leggings here that have become my fave! Very affordable pricing too! It was actually hard to choose what to get as I really liked everything! The downstairs area had a couch where my SO hung out while I tried things on. Very happy with my purchase here especially with the vibe because normally I don't feel comfortable enough when shopping to try things on in the dressing rooms. Will be back!"
0,Whoever answered the phone messed up not only our call ahead but the guy in front of us. Neither hostess could understand mix up. When you call ahead for six you expect to get seated in a reasonable time not forty five minutes later.
3,Zen is a good sushi bar with drink specials.  The hot entrees are Korean inspired I would recommend the short ribs. Tuesday is the best night to grab sushi here because that is when the fresh fish comes in.  The avocado and spicy tuna with wonton chips is an amazing appetizer.
4,Went to Spinners with my Wife for drinks and appetizers. Michelle Carlin made and served us our Cosmos to perfection! The appetizers were delicious and the view from the Rooftop Grille was amazing. We highly recommend Spinners Rooftop Grille!
0,"My dad has been working to recover from a ""simple procedure"" at Barnes that gave him MERSA (staff infection) and after all sorts of positives and negatives, they were told today that discharge is Sunday. Except that he can't discharge home. Absolutely unbelieveable. Send people here only to die. They do not, DO NOT, give a damn."
4,We ordered the squid ink calamari and parma and the margarita pizza. Everything was delicious. The calamari was my boyfriend's top 5 of all time and the pizza was the best I've had in a long time. Yum!!
4,"What a fantastic spot. If you've never had Ethiopian food there's a good chance you'll like it. The flavors are unique, very palatable, the atmosphere here is great, and the service is wonderful. Highly recommend stopping by and checking this out. They even offer you options which include samples of many of their dishes so it makes choosing what to eat easy!"
0,"Worst experience of my life. The man who did my manicure argued with me because I don't like gel on my nails. He filed them into a sharp square, painted so thick and lumpy, they chipped immediately. His nails were disgusting and dirty. I didn't want to be touched by his hands."
4,This is my favorite Mexican restaurant. Now if I can just get them to add tres leches to the dessert menu it would be the perfect Mexican restaurant.
1,The tour was a little lame.  We learned some history but not so much on the ghost side.  The guide was okay but way TOO loud.
3,Nice intimate setting. The grilled cheese was just what I was looking for and the service met expectations.
3,"Seriously good. Way better than Ritas. 

And you can't beat the price. A kiddie cup of custard is something like $1 and is pretty substantial. 

Love that they are open year round so I can't get my ice-y fill all winter long!"
4,"Best bagels around!! You have to try the jalapeño cheddar  Great people, great place!"
4,When you're in Nashville and you're a county music fan this is a must stop.  The tour was just the right amount of information and things to see.
4,Had the chicken shawarma and it was fantastic! All the ingredients were nice and fresh and the food was so cheap! Great place to grab takeout on a week night.
0,Fcking service! Don't ever come here. They set me an appointment and they are not fcking following it. They just wait me in line for fcking 30mins. Wth? I don't recommend sprint to any or whoever wants to switch carrier.!!!!
4,"This is the second time we have called this company for a mini move.  We had to have storage boxes moved to a storage facility nearby.  Kyle and Elijah were very courteous and professional!  The move went so smoothly and our belongings were lifted carefully.
We will definitely be calling them in the future for another move!"
4,My second time at Salon Solei did not disappoint! Kailah is amazing . She has picked up where my stylist of over twenty years left off and added her own touch ! I am so glad I picked this salon. All the girls are great My daughter had her hair cut by Tianna and was also happy . I have found my new home . Hope Kailah like me
4,"Came here first with a friend who showed me. It's so cool, you just order a pizza and you can pick out all your toppings from their selection. Tastes great too and not overpriced !"
2,King State was recommended by a friend for the pastries. Specifically the sticky buns. The sticky bun was everything the recommendation said it was! Warmed perfectly with crispy edges. Goes great with coffee so you definitely wanna add that to the mix The parking wasn't great. They were super busy! A good problem to have. I had to park in handicapped space to run in for my order. There was also a long wait to have my pastry warmed but it was worth it. Enjoy!
3,I went to Umai Desu with my bf today for the 2nd time in a few months and I loved every single bit of it! We always get the Regular Party Boat which consists of 10 rolls and 4 sashimi. All this for $39! The quality of the sushi is really good and the service is always great!
4,Gladiator slice is unbelievable!  It takes a minute to get thru the line but it is worth it.
4,"Word is bond. I went in, they helped me find exactly what I wanted. Fast and friendly. I'm super happy with my 213 and the price was right."
3,Service was great. I sat at the sushi bar and my sushi chef was very pleasant. The food was good especially for an all you can eat.
1,This place was meh.  Seating was quick but the service definitely was not.  Our server never checked on us after taking the food order so thank the lort that atleast the food was decent.  I ordered the garlic bacon oysters and sautéed crab claws.   Pretty much not memorable enough for me to visit again though
4,"Champs has got the good cuts and good vibes on lock! 

Just got a fresh touch up for the gram. You already know Sergio is gonna knock the ball out of the park when you sit down in his chair. 

Champs gets 5 stars all around for quality and friendly atmosphere!"
1,"Came hoping for the definitive Philly cheesesteak, but left disappointed. The meat was bland, bread was chewy, and my sandwich was $10 - which was too much to pay considering quality of the sandwich and the hassle it took navigating narrow streets to get there!  Really, the only positive thing I can say about it is: the service was quick! Honestly, I have had far superior Philly cheesesteaks from cheap chain restaurants."
3,The servers are friendly and helpful. The cheese fondue is so good that its worth a visit all by itself.
3,"We love this place.  We have been eating here for years. The tacos are huge and delicious. There are so many choices from bowls, tacos, burritos. Then seafood , pork, beef,etc. The chips are homemade but not hot but the queso or guacamole is delicious. they are friendly and have a few craft beers and great sodas also."
4,My husband and I absolutely love The Poki! The ingredients are high quality and always very fresh. The employees are always friendly and help me build my bowl. They are also very accommodating of my soy allergy! We also love the music they play in the store.
3,"Back in November, I came here for brunch with my bridesmaids and my mom before we went shoe shopping. The food was absolutely delicious - I had a beef brisket served with potatoes and I believe a pineapple salsa (I think it was pineapple). The beef was really tender and the pineapple salsa was a nice refreshing touch to the dish. We will definitely be coming back here for brunch, and I would love to try out their dinner menu as well!"
3,"Always a good meal here.  Service is efficient - the line moves fast and folks behind the counter know what they are doing.  Pleasant atmosphere for eating-in with a really decent soundtrack played at a comfortable volume.  And reasonably priced, too.  Tables are kept clean."
0,This is already a homophobic place of business. However my treatment at orange Grove was terrible. The manager said I was intrusive!! Why because I am gay?? Horrible service!!! I'll never ever step foot in another hobby lobby again! I know many people in this town don't worry they will steer clear from shopping here.
4,"All I can say is wow! This place is fantastic. Five star, worth the money. I'm a hotel snob and from the second we stepped on the property I felt like I was treated like a queen. The rooftop bar is gorgeous, the rooms are clean, nice linens, and I cannot say enough about the staff. Everyone so nice and accommodating. Splurge! It'll be worth it."
4,"Dined here with a couple of friends during their lunch buffet, the food variety was delicious and fresh. The options you receive are different from a lot of restaurants around the area, and all at a great price ! I have also dined with them for their dinner service, just like the lunch the food was exceptional and I forgot our servers name but he made the experience feel like going to my mothers house. As well if you have a sweet tooth this is the spot to be, try their desert sampler  you can thank me later !"
4,I can't express how amazing her cakes are. She did my daughter's first birthday cake back in 2009 and everyone at the party was blown away. A few months later she did my son's cake and it was equally incredible. I am so excited she now has her own bakery shop. I look forward to ordering many more.
2,"Staff was friendly. Nice atmosphere. Booth cushions are torn though and hurts your legs. 

Shrimp tikka masala was delicious but the butter chicken masala was only decent. 

The portions are extremely small for its price. It would fill you up if you order more carbs like their garlic naan, etc."
3,"Located smack dab on South Street, Lorenzo's is a hotspot for some pizza after a night of drinking. Even without drinking, you can't pass up their huge slice of cheese pizza for just $3.50.

The pizza is pretty good for what it is. It's your standard cheese pizza that is relatively thin. Top it off with some parmesan and hot sauce, and you got yourself a great deal for a solid slice of pizza."
1,"The appetizers were good, atmosphere is good.  Mixed drinks are ok, some are pretty watery. 

Waited about 40 minutes for our entrees After our appetizers had come out.  Salmon was dry and felt like it was frozen even though it said it was caught fresh from the line.  Management comped all of our salmons afterwards."
3,"Stopped in for some lunch.  Nicely decorated and great atmosphere.  I ordered a kale beet salad which was delicious but small.  My kids ( young adults) ordered the fried chicken on biscuit sandwich and could not finish it, it was huge and flavorful.  The options available for coffee and teas was outstanding adding as well.  Food took a little long but I think no it's because the food is freshly made."
4,"Excellent staff; they keep things moving. The clientele can be a little snobby, but whatever. I like how friendly the staff is. I am usually here killing time before doctors appointments, so the location is perfect for me."
4,"Loved this place.  Nothing in particular, just great service, friendly bartender, good drinks.  Wasn't looking for food so can't rate it the place itself seemed great.  Very friendly bartender, didn't get his name, and a generally comfortable atmosphere.  Highly recommended."
4,"The lady at the front desk is WONDERFUL! She will explain everything if you don't understand it, they are very respectful and kind. 

Best repair place I have been to in a long time!"
3,"I have gone here a few times for some celebratory drinks, nice back patio, nice staff, friendly atmosphere, I like."
3,"Ordered delivery and it came in a flash.  Not only was the service quick, but their menu is very extensive.  I got the brisket tacos, which were just the right amount (3 tacos per order).  They were super flavorful and not loaded with condiments either.  My husband enjoyed a burrito, which was literally the size of his head.

We've ordered from a few good Mexican places in the past, but El Sabor is not good, it's great!"
0,"Avoid this location, very under staffed.  30 minute queue to pick up and no one in the return queue to check out."
3,This is the only place I ever order take out pizza. Fantastic pizza. Wings are also good. Not much of a place for dining in. There are tables but not much atmosphere. I've had people visit who picked up uncooked pizza so they can enjoy it out-of-state.
4,"Collision repair is something you never want to have to do, but Church Brothers made it painless and went above and beyond. When my insurance messed up the claim, they even took care of calling to make sure everything was right. I was never in the dark about the status of my car and their response time was impeccable. With service like that, I won't go anywhere else - not that I want a reason to go back to collision repair shop."
3,The food is very good here. I loved the freshness of the toppings o the pizza. The only downfall is the portions were small for the price
3,"Still love this place. But our last visit was not as perfect as the others. Two factors: crazy loud music that meant part of our order wasn't actually heard; and the order taking being interrupted by calls for take-out orders. I tried to speak to a manager, it took longer than our food prep and my complaint recieved a shoulder shrug and an eye roll.  

Good food but staff needs some training."
4,The service was really nice. Very fast no wait at all hardly. I also had to purchase 13 5$ gift cards for a business event and the cashier made my experience so pleasant she was so kind! I appreciate this level of service.
1,They charged me a cover a cover to get into this terrible place...that alone gets you 2 stars
4,"I can heartily recommend Zander Insurance. First of all they only offer insurance from highly rated, established and secure insurance companies. Also, their customer service is 2nd to none!

I recently had the pleasure of being assisted by Rebecca Jobe, Associate VP of Customer Experience at Zander, and what an amazing experience.

She personally assisted with answering my questions -- always in a timely manner -- and walked through the entire process with me to completion.

As a result, I can say that I am a satisfied customer and will be recommending Zander to friends and family."
4,I have been here three times in the last week and I was blessed to have Courtney 2 of those 3 times. She is charming and warm and always suggests the best things. Her personality is bright and so genuine and sweet. She is my absolute favorite!
3,"Beautiful building with so much character.

The facility serves as a TRUE diverse hub of the downtown community.

Not just a gym - it's honestly ..truly.. a gem! Lol"
4,Great Boars head turkey sandwich.  Sat out back and watched the wildlife.  You can't beat the view.  It was reasonably priced and was exactly what I wanted!
4,"I love the Twin Dragon. Best crab Rangoon and egg rolls ever. The service is good, it's always consistent, and the prices are great. We always come back after trying other places. The vegetables are always fresher and that makes a big difference to me. Plus, they know how to do tofu right!!!!! Thanks Twin Dragon!!!!"
4,"This is a very nice McDonalds. It is brand new, has two drive thru lanes, has a nice staff, a clean facility, and high tech menus. I usually don't eat at McDonalds, but I sometimes come here for the breakfast and the T because it is so convenient and it is such a nice place to go for a fast food place."
3,"I really like this location and the food that is served here. I always get the Baja shrimp tacos, chips, and tamales. I absolutely love all their dressings and feel that the recipe keeps close to its Mexican roots. I appreciate that very much as it is difficult to find good and authentic Mexican food around."
2,"Nice website, great prices, and good pizza + salads.  Only thing is, my online confirmation said my order would be ready in 20 minutes.  I showed up 20 minutes later and had to wait an EXTRA 30 minutes for my food.  It was my first time ordering from here and the lady in front of me told me she orders there a lot and has never had that happen before.  But seriously, how does that happen?  My wife was seriously grumpy..."
4,"I came here for a manicure and pedicure first and had a great experience! I thought both technicians were wonderful. I loved my nails. And they lasted a long time. I did regular polish on the toes and gel manicure. 

I was impressed the first time so I came back about a month later for some waxing. I did full legs and Brazilian. The owner did it and she was thorough, clean and respectful! I am very happy with the wax job. 

I think I officially found my new place for nails and waxing! 

Plus they give a cash discount."
4,"Complimentary hotel shuttle to and from airport and locations within 3 miles. Small mall with movie theater about 15mins away (walking). Target and whole foods grocery 20mins away (walking). 

Beautiful lobby area with lush folaige and stream. Nice but small gym overlooking indoor pool. Rooms have sitting area with flat screen tv, desk, and microwave, and fridge. Bedroom has additional flat screen along with door to sitting area for quiet sleep."
4,"Went here during a Bachelorette brunch, awesome and worth the wait! Try the mimosas with French toast!"
4,Had my 6 mos old pup in daycare on Saturday which is a godsend to people who work the weekends!  Everyone was pleasant and gave good feedback on my dog. Thanks Pit Stop. She'll be back
4,"This place deserves five stars for their professionalism. After giving them only two stars, and venting my complaints they promptly called me the very next day to see what they could do to retain me as a customer. I appreciate that excellent customer service and need to address it publicly. Running a business is not a walk in the park and it won't always be perfect. Thank you for that proactive response Soak, cheers to you!"
3,"I went in looking for a new vacuum cleaner, and it turned out I just needed a $25 hose - they saved me a lot of money!!!

I would give 5 stars, but I found the person at the register to be a bit cranky.  I'll give him the benefit of the doubt because he did what a good business person does.  So thanks!

By the way, I saw an old Electrolux vacuum cleaner!  It was just like the one my parents had in the 1960's they had acquired used.  Lots of old vacuum cleaners!"
2,I had the chicken and waffle and I asked them to put the chicken on the side so the juice/sauce wouldn't be on the waffle but that wasn't done. The chicken was ok. Slightly dry and the waffle was good but a part of it had the chicken sauce on it. I doubt it I'll order it again when I'm back in town visiting my hometown.
4,A really cool place to hang out in or get some work done. I'm here all the time and the staff is always super friendly and welcoming. The coffee is great and they have lots of different pastry options!
4,"First bite into that chicken and a friend said,  ""this is a fat girl's heaven.""

Waited about an hour on line and figured out we could place a ""take out order"" on their site so that our food was ready at a given time. 

Let me tell you, worth the wait! And get the banana pudding! Came with two friends and got the jumbo tenders in medium and two chicken breasts in mild. Just the right amount of hotness, in my opinion. The flavour was good, chicken skin crispy, and the chicken tasted awesome. 

Would definitely recommend and return."
2,"Very ""meh"", food was standard bar food that taste pretty standard. Not bad, not great..The service was okay but not great. The waitress was texting on her phone sitting at the bar most of the night. But she was tentative from time to time. Beer selection was lame and lacked in the craft beer world. This is the place to go if you expect ""standard"" everything across the bar, and they can because they are right across for Bankers Fieldhouse."
3,"From out of town and find Ristorante Al Freesco to be a very nice restaurant.  The service was great and food was good.  Most customers seem to be regulars.    This trip I had the 2 pork-chops which had great flavor, but was slightly dry.   Would definitely come back for another meal."
0,The owners/management have total disregard for people and are only interested in herding people through like cattle. Should've known by all the bad reviews not to try them but lesson definitely learned!  STEER CLEAR!  Don't learn the hard way like all before you have.
3,"Tried this today after they brought in food for one of my coworkers to sample. The owner is incredibly nice. 

I had the gazpacho (very good) the cush salad (good) and the vegan chorizo stuffed peppers (amazing) 

I can't wait to order lunch from here!!!"
4,I went for my birthday last year and the food was awesome it was eight of us and we had a private room so we are going to have a girls night out and go again for dinner awesome.
4,This place is extremely underrated! I got a gluten-free pizza here and it was AMAZING! One of the best GF pizzas I've ever had. Highly recommend!
3,"Just for the station where they stir fry your selections, I would give it 5 stars. Ample variety of fresh meats, seafood, veggies and herbs and condiments. Best in its class! Unfortunately, the sushi and the desserts did not come up to par, disappointing. Service was very good overall though"
1,Love the Mafz on 12 South. This one in Franklin has consistent bad service and subpar pizza. Not sure why the 2 locations are so different.
0,"Used to love this place!!  No more, gave it three more tries!!  DIRTY, silverware is gross, food is cold.  It used to be great, we were excited about going here for great food and drinks but don't bother now.  Very sad but again gave it three good tries and each were a complete failure.  I don't know if there isn't management on staff but it's clearly apparent things have changed for the worse."
4,"Pizza here is actually pretty damn good. Besides the place being pretty classy and clean, the price wasn't too bad. I had a personal pepperoni and a Cesar salad with a drink and I payed like 12 bucks. I'm a truck driver that delivers to all the sears stores, so I'm lucky enough to try out countless food places and check out their malls. Will definitely try this place again."
3,A wonderful place for gifts and house stuff..Like the vibe and the staff.  Its pricey..its the main line..
4,"Excellent place for vintage items that are chic and beautiful. Many fine items from purses to fur coats and even lingerie. The basement has been decorated to feel like an upscale boutique. Definitely check out all the items as some may be tucked away in drawers and cubby holes. 

Will check back frequently"
0,"Save your time and money. The same as Taco Bell but, without as many choices. 
They do put more mystery meat then Taco Bell but that's it.
If you want a good taco go to the food trucks."
2,"I can only give this brewery 3 stars. while their beer choices are many and the two samples I had were actually very good their food was not that pleasing. I was highly disappointed in the sandwich I had. It was dry and not very ""tasty"". There was a band there the night I was there, which was a nice addition, but the place is so small and the acoustics so poor  that I had to literally scream to be heard by my friend sitting right next to me. Go for the beer and go before the band starts playing."
3,Love their apple pie a la mode!  Yum!!
3,Wonderful vet and staff and he NEVER tries to sell you stuff. GREAT PRICES! BUT hours and communication accessibility are TERRIBLE! Voicemail if you ever get it always has wrong dates. Impossible to get a human. Hours on business card never match phone accessibility. I would give 5 stars if I could get hold of them 9 out of the 10 times I call. When I do though it is well worth it.
0,Love the food & the servers but the owners are pompous. I hate that I love the rolls- otherwise I drop this place like a hot bag if dog poo.
0,"DO NOT BUY A GIFT CARD OR VISIT THIS SPA.  

First, this place is over-priced.  I have been to other spa establishments that have better facials/massage than the place here for much more reasonable price tag.  I would not recommend the service.

Second, I wanted to cancel a gift card that I bought less than 24 hours ago, and the person said there is no cancellation allowed even though the purchase was by accident.  

They must really need the money because their spa sucks and that's why they cannot afford to refund gift certificates that were made less than 24 hours ago."
0,They messed up my order and put cheese and spicy sauce all over my tacos when I didn't order it. I don't eat dairy so I wasn't happy at all. And then when I took all the cheese off to try and not waste the food I had I found a hair in my food. Not cool. Not happy. Completely ruined my food.
3,"The donut options are very creative and beautiful. Also, they taste great! You should try them if you're in the mood for a donut."
4,"Simply put, this is an excellent pizza. 

Now on to the review...pizza pie can make of a good meal or a bad one. 

Magazine pizza is delicious and with every bite you want more. 

Good pizza has a tasty crust, fresh ingredients and baked well.  Especially the cheese, so fresh. 

In a town where you can find 100 different great restaurants, Magazine Pizza is amazing."
0,"Submitted a plan ahead pizza at 10:50am to pick up at noon.  Got here at noon and stood around until12:45. I understand they were busy because we had a snowstorm that day. But if they can't have the pizzas ready when the customer requested them, then they should let you know so you're not standing around for 45 minutes."
4,"Perhaps the best vodka selection I have ever seen... And reasonably priced. A very modern atmosphere that can appease all crowds. Go there for the drinks, but order a snack and you won't be disappointed."
1,"I've given this location a couple more tries and the drive thru wait is simply too long - 21 minutes today and probably as long last time. Other locations in Franklin can handle as much traffic in half the time. There were also items missing from my order. I wish I could report a better experience, but Chick-fil-A can do better here. This Highway 96 chicken shack needs help!"
4,People are stupid but this place isn't. Anthony is a beast at customer service and repairs!
0,"The staff is really rude, the kitchen appears dirty, and nobody who works there wears a mask."
2,"Great service even though she had pretty heavy tables. The live music was great. Super small portion for the fried green tomatoes. My wedge salad was okay, the lettuce had so much water that it tasted bland. My boyfriend had the burger with small pieces of pulled pork on it, he thought they ran out. Overall I'd probably just come for the drinks and music."
1,I went here for a private party upstairs in one of their rooms. The food wasn't very good. The drinks were ok. I did like the open space though.
4,"Best pub in Boise, great beer, great food, great experience. Great location in the heart of downtown, normally always able to go and sit right down. The outdoor seating is particularly good."
3,Great Food! Nice calming atmosphere.Decor was very unique and comfortable seating.Prices were affordable.I will come back here again!!
4,"If you've never been to this location, make this your next lunch or dinner date!! Even the president has dined here!

Save room for dessert, which lovingly is first in line as you make your way through the cafeteria style line. The roast chicken is to die for and don't forget to add a cup of matzo ball soup!"
4,Service was amazing and food came out hot and flavorful! The green curry was so filling and satisfying. Definitely recommend!
4,"Y'all. I have dreams about this place. When they reopened after COVID, my husband and I were there the next day. We love the poke bowls, bento boxes, and acai bowls. Everything excellent. The place inside is pristinely clean. Joe and his staff are awesome. Joe makes his own rice wine vinegar for his rice and it is the best white rice that I've ever had. He also makes his own Chinese pickles for poke bowls that are fabulous. If you haven't tried it yet, GO! You will not be disappointed."
2,"For a late night burrito or carne fries, this place isn't too bad. I gave it some stars off for the crappy salsa & guac. Also, don't expect decent customer service here.
The employees could definitely use a crash course in manners. However, it's only a block from my place so it will do for the late night Mexican munchies."
4,Their customer service is unmatched and their food is delicious. Didn't take long for my boyfriend and I to become regulars. I personally love the shrimp udon noodles !
4,"This place is awesome!! Second time here and I feel like a regular. Tasty food, great drink specials and awesome staff!!"
4,Ate lunch here a couple of days ago...we had fish tacos with pico de gallo and a tuna sandwich on marble rye bread with lettuce tomato cucumber and onion...tacos and salsa were excellent...the marble rye bread for the tuna sandwich was super fresh...great lunch...friendly staff...highly recommend.
3,Very delicious burgers. It's a must visit. Table setup is. But strange but there's plenty of television sets to watch whatever game is on at the time.  Food was great service was great given the crowd and the ambiance was relaxing
2,"We stopped in & bought a couple boxes of cookies, cupcakes & other goodies to take home to our family; nothing lasted long. Everything was out of this world delicious and memorable! However, the gal who works there could use a class on friendly service 101."
4,"here for my 1 month touch up, happy with my results so far cant wait to see how my eyebrows look once completely healed"
1,"LOUD OPEN KITCHEN: because the noisy chef yells his conversation to the baristas;
NO REFILLS on coffee; apparently these people don't know about lagniappe;
DELICIOUS BREAKFAST BURRITO with a bowl of fruit and iced coffee: a hefty $17!

I'm glad the atrabilious & taciturn faux-lenians have this comparably rude & disquieting establishment to frequent.  It keeps them out of places prefered by locals."
3,"Great barbecue, great environment, great service. Loved the ribs. Didn't care for the vinegar based sauce on the pulled pork, reminded me of NC BBQ, but loved the rest of it."
4,"I Love This Place its my favorite restaurant.  I can eat here every week. The soups are always amazing. I love them. Whoever makes it knows what they're doing. The garlic bread is soft and delicious.  The pasta specials are always very creative and treat the palette. I usually get the specials.  
Great service,  the food comes out quickly and they keep your drinks filled.  
I love this place."
3,"My daughter loved...loved...loved this place and made me promise that this would be a monthly ritual.  Okie dokie by me!!!  A little unconventional, but that is what I love about Indy...totally surprising :-)

Since my DeKalb daughter will be visiting in a couple of weeks, going to try and schedule a time for her to experience Foot Finesse.  After having given birth 5 weeks ago...she could use a little pampering...if her daughter can part with her for an hour that is."
0,"Stopped by to satisfy my craving for Sarku Japan at South County Center in St. Louis a couple weeks ago and was so disappointed to find it had closed, even though it still says Open on your website which says it was updated today. I guess it was due to lack of business as there are only 3 places left in that food court. I wonder if that will happen to other mall locations. I hope you do a better job of updating your list."
4,Really really good ramen!! The service was great and cocktails were good too. Officially obsessed
3,"This place is adorable and a definite Newtown attraction! Without it, the main drag would not be the same. A great place to stop by with your kids or pets or whatever (not that they would let your dog inside but you can still ""hang"" in front of the store), do some people watching, run onto someone you know, etc. etc. The staff is friendly and efficient, the place is funky and neat, the choices are overwhelming, the ice cream? ... it's OK and overpriced, ahhhhhhh, it's a perfect Newtown experience!"
4,I had a lovely trip to Treo on Saturday. Tyler was awesome and made the best Sazeracs. The lamb meatballs and roasted cauliflower were delicious.
4,The food is nice and it's very dog friendly! We have two corgis and we sat outside. The service is A star! They got all our request even before we say. Appreciate their attention to details! Love the place the make us love Santa Barbara.
4,"Love Bookman's, Traded in Books at the Grant location took my Bookman Trade in to the one on Speedway and bought hiking and camping gear.

I love taking that paper ticket from the Bookstore to get a card at the Sports one. It makes it extra convenient because I lose my paper a lot while cleaning and its sturdier so I can wait a season to get more of what I really need. 

Thanks Bookman's"
4,"Susanne is AWESOME! I found this grooming store from the app Nextdoor. A lot of people recommended her, so I decided to give a try. My little dog is a pain in the neck. She is super hyper and a troublemaker. Susanne definitely knows how to deal with dogs and very experienced. My dogs came out super cute and well groomed. And her price is very reasonable!"
0,"This place was a huge disappointment for Thanksgiving dinner.  They served overly breaded/fried oysters that were bland and tasteless.  Isn't that a crime in NOLA?  And, their 'turkey' was really dried out turkey roll - and you didn't even get a choice of white or dark meat.  The serving staff was mediocre but the price was outrageous! I will never recommend or go to the Rib Room again.  Terrible experience."
1,"The guide was funny and nice but he fed the animals, although not the alligators, to lure them out. Feeding the wildlife is wrong on so many levels. Clearly, this is what the swamp tour companies do, but it's sad. If I had known, I would have looked for a company that prides itself on respecting the natural habitat of these animals and the animals themselves."
4,"Absolutely the best selection of frames and lenses in Tampa and an extremely helpful, friendly, and professional staff."
4,Fabulous!  Just finished eating here with my wife.  Our server Michael did an outstanding job! So fast and attentive! If the service wasn't enough..the food was out of this world! Definitely will be going here again! Great food and great service!  Highly recommend this restaurant!  Great experience!
4,"Katz Foam and Fabrics is the place.  I have all my foam cut here and come here for commercial fabric that they sell. 

Yo whiny people just go and buy on line. Save yourself now from a business that has been serving the greater Philadelphia area for decades. 

 Katz is an institution in philly."
4,I've come here at least 20 times since moving to the area. The staff is warm and inviting and prices are reasonable. My husband and I love the salsa bar.  Son loves the fountain RC cola option.  Among our favorites are the tamales with green sauce when you can get them. But I believe they have them more consistently now.   We always count on this place for good food and folks.
3,"I go for the burritos!  Paco's has the best fast food burros (as I call them) in town.  The tortillas are homemade, if not at Paco's, then someplace local.  The fillings are always tasty, and boy are they affordable!  My favorites are the breakfast burritos.  All of them!  I seem to remember trying other meals at Paco's and being underwhelmed, so I will continue to stick with what I like.  Give them a try."
4,I could eat here everyday!  Huge portion sizes and authentic Colombian food!  The staff is super nice and speaks English if your Spanish is as bad as mine. Can get pretty busy on weekends.
0,"Horrible custumer service, the staff doesnt really pay attention to the customer and their clenliness is pretty bad. I took akmost an hour for us to get our food after ordering and our server wasnt as nice as a server should be. The food is ok maybe a  7/10 i really wouldnt recomend this place to anyone."
3,"Amazing breakfast biscuit sandwiches and coffee beverages. Reasonable prices, plenty of seating inside and outdoors. Will be returning next time I'm in St. Pete!"
4,Follicle's Francesca Rivetti is a world renown colorist and stylist though remains (for some unfathomable reason)  a hidden gem in Philly. Book an appointment with the master for a truly fresh look. And they now carry Déva products for no-frizz curly hair. So much more natural than Ouidad stuff and perfect for our famous humid summer!
4,"This is a must stop for the craft and import beer fan. Great world class Belgians you wont find in most beer bars...great craft selection, and the mussels are a great choice.
Overall, these guys are great. Great."
4,"Fantastic food, great service, fairly priced and their margaritas are outstanding! This is definitely one of my favs and it's Mexican good with a slight twist! You have to sample the ribs upon visiting and the corn fritters are amazing..... love this little gem of the south city St Louis area! 

Priced reasonably 
Great parking
Exceptional service 

Best of all GREAT FOOD!"
1,"I had no cash, so I asked when I came in if I could just get a coffee and pay with debit card and was told 'yes' . 
Coffee was good by the way, but when I went to pay I was told there was a $10 min for using a card or a .75 surcharge.  Next time I want an expensive coffee I'll find a Starbucks!"
1,"Shane the cleaner was very nice but. ....
There were two very pronounced dark spots left in one area and this morning I had to clean them and  my hardwood floors as he didn't us the protective booties and there was a ton of dirt where he was walking back and forth."
4,I have been using this restraint since it opened and I always had a great experience. From the show of how they cook the food to the taste.
4,"What an incredible gem  in the middle of Reno! Probably one of the best restaurants I've eaten in the last 10 years including in Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco. 
Our waiter was Travis and he was outstanding. At our table we had seafood, pork and steaks, all were cooked to perfection."
3,"I have never stayed at one hair salon for very long. That was before Bree started coloring my hair 3-4 years ago. I won't go anywhere else for color. My nature hair color is dark brown which I like to keep light brown/ dark blonde. Every where else I've been to....the color would turn out brassy. Not here. Bree is great! Hair cuts are pricey especially if you are just getting a simple trim.  Coloring, on the other hand, is affordable and fair."
1,"This place can barely handle the appointments let alone walk-ins. Speaking to the other patients that had an appointments they stated that they still waited 30 to 45 minutes.  Those of us that did not have appointments, it's has been an hour and a half to two hour wait. I haven't had experience with the staff yet.  To be honest I'm a little scared to talk with them since they come across rude and abrupt with their communications with other patients.  Trying to keep a positive attitude."
4,This place is amazing especially if you have kids with you! Parents can enjoy adult activities and drinks while kids are very entertained with many amenities for kids.
1,"*BE WARNED, NOT A TRUE DINER. MORE OF A JOHNNY ROCKETS STYLE DINER. ADDITIONALLY BREAKFAST STOPS AT 11AM*

Service: slow and lacking effort. Service is definitely not a priority. 

Atmosphere:   Cheesy 40s theme that's again more Johnny Rockets than authentic. 

Food: You aren't a diner when breakfast ends at 11am. Food was mediocre but came quickly. 

Only giving it two stars because I should've put more time into researching the place.  I'm assuming all the Google reviews are paid for."
3,"Saw ""Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat"" here in 1999 with Patrick Cassidy as Joseph and Debbie Gibson as the narrator,  then came back in 2005 to see ""Hairspray.""  Both productions were great, the technical setup of the theater allowed for all the light effects, etc. (especially the ones in ""Joseph"") to come through at their full capacity, and our seats weren't so bad either.  Would definitely come back to see another production."
4,"So I've been here a few times on my lunch hour and the pizza is pretty good, right... Today my husband brings me an eggplant parm ... I was just in the mood. Madddddonnnne this eggplant was soooooo good, yet soooooo bad. Fried to perfection, smothered in cheese. Never again - but if you're looking to experience heaven, order that! Oh mannnn."
2,Place has always had awesome pepperoni bread. My favorite when I am not making my own but they seem to have changed how they are making it. I am not sure what the difference is but it is not nearly as good as it used to be. Don't get me wrong bagels and crumb cake are still great but they have been known for their pepperoni bread. This is the only reason for the decrease in stars.
0,"This Starbucks is on my way to work but I'd rather go anywhere else. Takes absolutely forever and the staff will literally ignore you in line or at the drive thru, no acknowledgement that they even know you're there."
3,"Fun facts I learned about Mill Creek last time I visited:

- They've got wifi (just ask for the password)
- The manager is a really cool dude
- They're licensed (what's up, coffee and Bailey's?)
- They serve weekend brunch!

And here I thought they were just a random cafe kinda far down Whyte Ave. The more you know!"
4,I love this nail shop. It's very relaxing and the staff is very personable! The atmosphere is great. I am planning a pamper party and the rates I was given were very reasonable. This nail shop is a must!
1,"This was not a good first experience. The tots were good but the breakfast was quite disappointing after such a long wait. However, the waitress was nice and they did apply a discount on the bill for the problems."
4,"In college, Dominoes pizza was terrible!
All dough and nothing else.
This Dominoes is actually really good. 
Most important , they are consistently good!
Very well managed and run there."
1,"Service: the service was quick and friendly which is always good inside a busy market. 

Food: the menu offers multiple different items in a wide array of classic Cajun food. The fried catfish was overbreaded and had very little meat inside. The fried Mac and cheese was good but it deff could of used a better sauce to go with it to make it take the extra step. The blackened chicken po-boy would have been completely elevated if they used better bread. The chicken was also slightly over cooked and tough"
1,"Love chik fil a, but unfortunately it's known friendly service is not really included in this location. As well as getting the orders right. This is my closest one, but I would rather go to the Brentwood or Mt Juliet location. Smyrna's location always seems to give me the wrong order or they forget to complete my order. And the rare times they do get it right, my chicken isn't well cooked. And to top it off, most of them are rude. Mt Juliet's location has always given me the best service and well cooked food!"
0,"This place has the worst service I have ever experienced. The one server refused to acknowledge us for 30 minutes until we called her out for not taking our order. She then went to every other table without any intention of making our shakes. She was rude, irritable and overall unpleasant. We walked out. Unacceptable, do not go here."
0,"Kiddie world all the under age employees at chickie's and Pete go there 
After there shifts food is awful just waiting for them to get raided"
0,Let's start off with the amount of flies that landed on my food every time I looked at my plate. Absolutely a nightmare!! If that's not enough the waiter never came to take my order after 15 minutes I had to asked a manager to help us. When our food arrived the $15.00 salad had maybe 15 wilted Rotten leafs of what probably was arugula. Just disgraceful considering lettuce is a 1000% profit. Real disappointment !!!
4,Great Local Restaurant! Off the tourist path with delicious Italian food. Definitely a welcome respite from the craziness of the French Quarter. I had their lasagna. Delicioso!
4,"I have been here several times and am always delighted. Whether it be for a nice night outside on their picnic tables or inside the energetic dining room it is always a great evening. My most recent venture there really stood the test of time. We had a huge group for our Thursday Night Therapy and it kept growing. They were very accommodating to us and tolerable. The service was still great as was the food! Later on we went downstairs and enjoyed live music, which I think something Indy is largely lacking. So that made my night even better. Only good things to say about this place!"
2,Drinks were good and food is ok but wow is the service slow! It wasn't even very busy and it took 20-30 minutes to get a drink
4,"Suffice to say if you dont know what Taco Bell is all about at this point in life, you are most definitely missing out.  Crunchy tacos, soft tacos, mexican pizzas, and double deckers are the only way i go.  the place rocks, and the hot sauces are a Mexican fast food staple.

Wash it all down with a Mt. Dew for maximum satisfaction!"
4,"This bakery is amazing, from the decor to the quality of the service.  Come to the frosted fox for friendky service from thr owners and then try one of their delicious desserts.  the prices are incredibly reasonable. The biggest problem is figuring out what you want to order. I recommend the giant snicker doodle cookie or the m&m cookie. Both were amazing and you really can't go wrong!"
0,"This place is disgusting, even by Steak 'n Shake standards.  It is filthy inside and out, even tabled that were ""bussed"" were still covered in crumbs and drink rings.  Service is slow, slow, slow.  Quality of the food is iffy.  If they didn't have my absolute favorite chili in town, I would never come here.  It takes me months to get back the courage to try them again. Corporate ARE YOU LISTENING?!?!?  S 'n S used to be THE BEST but now all your locations are dirty and filled with surly staff.  .  :-("
2,"Yikes. Well, to begin this store is gorgeous and full of beautiful items and a few novelty items that are super cute. The only thing is you will break your whole darn piggy bank into a million pieces if you purchase anything in this shop. I love my mom for instance but she would kick my butt if I spent over $200 on an oil burning wick candle for her no matter how gorgeous it is."
2,"A little over priced but good work, my tints look great. I even put my window down on accident right after and looks totally fine."
4,"A hidden gem. The food is fantastic and above traditional bar food though it's not fancy. The Hank Jim sandwich is my favorite as well as the Chelsey chicken ranch. The brew city fries are awesome and definitely get the cheese sauce. The service is great whether you sit at a table or eat at the bar. Good beer selection, great prices and excellent neighborhood spot. Very casual and fun atmosphere. No pretension, no bullsh*t just a great place for great drinks and amazing food."
4,Kim Campbell is the best ! We purchased a mattress and she honored the One Time Exchange indeed. She is really a superb store manager and so kind and professio nal! The quality of their mattresses ais just great and nobody can beat their prices and service!!!! Thank you so much Kim...
3,Had a quick breakfast with my son. He had the monte cristo and I the omelette. Great portions and very flavorful. Our server Heidi made two of the best lattes and cappuccinos we've had. Great spot in West Chester.
0,Greeted by rude staff at the entrance. Old beat up interior that needs repair immediately. Not high expectations for a diner but food tasted old served in dishes still wet from dishwasher. Finally it's way overpriced. $15 for bagel with cream cheese with nova... you can get that for $8 at Manhattan Bagel and it will be much better quality.
3,"Amazing view of the beach and surf good fast service, great food,  nice place to go for lunch"
3,"The foods pretty authentic and the lemonade was delicious! If you are craving guacamole, you must try theirs, soooooooo fresh lol. All in all I'd keep this as a go 2 spot, and it's cost efficient!"
0,"Walked in around 2pm. We were a little nervous being the parking lot was empty and it was Xmas eve. The shopping plaza next door was mobbed but this Sonnys couldn't get more than 3 customers. There is a smell of mold in the dining area and the tables are sticky. But wife and I sat down anyway and got drinks pretty fast but after waiting 30 minutes for our ""lunch special"" sandwiches we lost our patients. So we walked out and drove across the street to Bob Evans. Had a great lunch there."
3,"The Ribeye was cooked to perfection!! The drinks were strong and delicious, our hostess and server were so attentive and always made sure our water was filled.  It was a bit pricey, but the food is certainly worth it.  
I would suggest making a reservation on the weekends.  We had one and were about 15 min late (due to local construction) and they release your res after 15 minutes. Luckily, the hostess was a pro and made sure that we were seated very quickly.  This is a great local spot with a comfortable bar and energetic atmosphere."
4,"Read all the positive reviews and decided to come here to have my brake pads replaced.  Happy with the service, quality, and customer service.  Definitely will be back!  A+++++"
1,"We were underwhelmed. The service was very good, as was the ambience. The food left a lot to be desired.  The tortilla espanola was left on the plate, it was that bad.  The merluza was just ok. Too much salt on the pimientos.  

Amada really did not live up to it's yelp reviews.  It was our first time in Philadelphia. Maybe I am being overly harsh, or maybe the kitchen staffed was stressed because of restaurant week.  Either way, we will skip Amada next time."
4,We have ordered pizza twice. Each time we got quick service. The pizza is really amazing. We plan to visit often.
3,"Never had a reading before but have always wanted to. I was visiting New Orleans and ran into this place looking for another store. The reader was a very nice older gentleman and the reading was very thoughtful and open. I truly enjoyed coming here the only down side was the lady at the front desk was a little if putting but I was so excited to get my reading done, it was an after thought."
4,"We had a great experience. We went in looking for a prius, mostly based on the knowledge that we wanted to save money on gas. We were greeted and worked with Jay Alex. He was fantastic and really knew his stuff. He gave us so much information about the prius and really made us feel comfortable with what we were purchasing. Please ask for Jay if you are in the market for a Toyota and want someone who really knows his stuff! Great selection and matched online prices!"
2,"As others have said, service is quite slow and ""challenging"", but once you get past that, the food is pretty solid.  I had the Hot Chicken - it was very good. My wife had a cheeseburger.  She said it was good but not great.  Music is good, It's a fun environment, but be prepared to wait."
3,"Go early and you'll get seated straight away! Great variety of stuff, but by far my favorite bit, being a tea drinker, is rather than those dinky little nyquil cups with a handle that pass for a 'tea pot' in other places, you get an actual tea pot that yields at least 3 cups of tea-- if only all restaurants got this!
Thank you, Yolk!"
4,"This is the best place to go for a haircut for me. Abe does a great job every time, been coming here for over 5 years! I would recommend him for any guys looking for a great haircut.. My girlfriend now goes to him exclusively as well. We are always happy with his work!"
4,"It was so good. We really liked it. I had the Vista. We had one of each of the ramen at our table, they all had such different flavors. Delicious! We waited a while to get in, but it was worth the wait. We didn't know, but you can use the app Nowait to get in line before you go."
4,ALERT! I repeat ALERT!!! This small spot packs a big punch. If you are looking for great food with great flavor. Look no further. I am not from STL but I will be coming back and recommending this to everyone who comes. Whoever is cooking in the back... keep doing what you're doing.
2,"Stopped in for a late dinner snack. On a busy night in town, was quiet enough to calm my sensory overload from a day in the french quarter. Had the Jambalaya and hush puppies at the bar, and my service was excellent, and the food was just what the doctor ordered. Would love to check out more of the fare! Will be back. No complaints, but the place could have used a bit more attention to cleaning."
3,"An unexpected find in a strip shopping center in Ewing. Ewing itself is always a turn-off, a town waiting for an economic revival. This place, though, is worth the trip. Old-style Italian cooking well-prepared and reasonably priced. Service was friendly in an old-fashioned way. Nobody seemed scripted and trendy would never describe this place. The decor is just fine and everyone in our party of 8 was pleased with both the food and the ambience. We will be back. BYOB's are less common on the New Jersey side of the Delaware river, making this spot even better."
0,"This spot is the slowest most complicated Taco Bell I've ever been to. First off the wait to get to get to the drive thru just to order was over ten minutes. Then to order took 10 minutes because the person didn't know how to place the order. Then gave up and muttered ""this thing be confusing"" and went silent. A few minutes later another lady came on and had to take our order. When we got the food they messed up our order and left out some food. I DO NOT RECOMMEND! Find another spot and save your time."
0,These people are the worst. They ruined my dress and refused to pay AND they charged me! .
0,Ordered online. Drove 15 minutes to pick it up. Got there and was told they were out of bread and would refund my money. Couldn't figure out how to take my tip off. Recap: drove 15 minutes each way. Got no food. Paid $3 tip. Good times.
1,"This place reinforces masks pretty heavily. Great for those who are worried about covid! However, I did not see ANY employees whipe down a single machine during my stay. If you're going to reinforce masks, please complete the job and ensure that the machines are whipped down. This is unacceptable and just ironic."
2,"Sure the sound wasn't great, but unless you're at the Winspear, you really don't go to concerts expecting great sound.  The location is ace for parking and pre-concert eats.  The venue itself has options for sitting and standing (and crowd surfing, as necessary).  The staff are top notch.  I'd go again."
0,"Please don't plan on staying at the Ramada Airport Hotel, very unprofessional approach to customer service or "" lack of any service ""  After confirming my reservation, our room booking was deleted and sold to another customer at 1am . ExEnjoy the evening sleeping at the Indianapolis airport. Save yourself a huge headache and stay away from this place. Worst Ramada customer service, I have ever experienced ! One star isn't diserverd."
4,"Love this place! Came with a friend for her birthday, and neither of us had been before. We sat on the patio and there was a fire going in the outdoor fireplace. Service was fantastic, and we went with recommendations. We had a great bottle of Malbec and tried four small plates. We loved three of them, and the fourth was good, but just not our personal preference. We were really pleasantly surprised because it was a very small place, yet service and food was top notch. We will be back!"
3,"The food here is wonderfully vegetarian and vegan and always fresh and tasty. I have had lunch here more than a dozen times in the last six months. I love the falafel salad deal, it  is great. I also love the broccoli and cauliflower mix although that can be oily some times. None-the-less, if you want inexpensive and tasty in a clean, welcoming environment, have lunch or dinner at Maoz."
3,"I like this place pretty straight forward in my opinion. So I pretty much ordered a Fried Avocado Taco, a Chicken Taco, and an Elote. So an Elote is a delicious version of Corn on the Cob on crack I call it. The tacos here are delicious and will definitely hit the spot if you are in a taco mood, which I pretty much always am in that type of mood. Oh and on top of it the prices are very reasonable. Please note they only accept cash."
4,"I love Pantano! I love the music, I love the pastors! It's a large church so don't let that scare you. Get involved in small groups or volunteer; that's where I made friends. They have plenty of small groups and volunteer opportunities. I feel the sermons are always very relatable to life. I wasn't very religious before I came here and now I am becoming closer to god since coming."
3,"A New Orleans classic, you have to at least stop in for a drink. Just a little bit down from the main drag of Bourbon, but still pretty close. Lots of history here if you care about it, and generally just a good place to chill."
2,"Pros: No wait time. Great server. Perfectly seared scallops and asparagus. Great mango salsa. Decent coleslaw, not over sauced. Key lime pie tangy. Whipped cream real. Food well presented. Decor pleasant. 

Cons: Mojito was watered down. Steak was over cooked, waiter put in a new one, and then undercooked. Was told, ""They were probably trying to get it out in a hurry."""
0,"I would stay away from this company. They do not take care of their vehicles and they don't care about your time.  As a result of not taking care of vehicles, they were stopped by Truck enforcement and told that their vehicle was not fit for the road. This delayed my move by 3 hours. The owner did not care about the impact on me as a customer. Its a shame, because the moving team was great and took very good care of my move. I would find another company if your time is important to you."
1,"The service was awful. Took forever  for us to get our food, which would normally be fine, but for an empty fast food restaurant, no. There is barely any seating. Only 2 seater tables and one massive table. Smells like sewage in the entire restaurant but worse in the bathroom. The food was average. I would only recommend going through the drive through if you want cheap average food."
4,"This is the perfect place for inexpensive good japanese food. Especially when your tired of greasy burgers, pizza and other processed foods. 
The large bento boxes are packed with crispy vegetables. The salmon is always fresh and delicious. The short grain rice is nicely prepared.
 The ambiance is fairly minimal and utilitarian. The bathroom is large and clean but you need to get a key. Perhaps that is the key to how they keep it clean.
This great little lunch place is not Morimoto, but of you want fresh delicious Japanese food quick at a great price this place is a nice little secret"
4,"Fresh mozz, best in philly. I wish I lived closer to 9th"
4,"First and foremost, The groomer Chrissie is simply fantastic! She absolutely knows her stuff, and gave my lil rescue mutt an excellent hair cut. Also, in an area where everything is overpriced, Chrissie is amazingly affordable. Could not recommend her more. The rest of the staff at this store is very, very friendly and very helpful. Again, nice change from the awful customer service that seems prevalent on the main line. If you have a furry friend, this is the place to go!"
3,"Thin crust, wonderful toppings.  I got the Scallopine chicken pizza, which had chicken, mozzarella, portabello mushrooms, and San Marzano tomatoes.  The only problem was that there was not enough cheese on my pizza, and the crust was slightly over-cooked/burnt.  The staff was super friendly, and I loved the cozy feel of the shop.  I would go back, but would probably need to order it with extra cheese."
4,"Brickers is one of our favorite places! We love their Southwestern Chicken salad, Southwestern chicken wrap, and BLTA wrap with sidewinder fries. They are doing curbside during the stay at home order so you don't even have to go in! They always provide great service and delicious food. I wish we lived closer and could go more often."
4,Bomb breakfast burritos served by real Mexicans! Authentic small taco shop experience. Lunch is also great. Great enchilada sauce. Can't beat the potatoes on the breakfast burritos either. The staff always remembers my order and are kind and in a great mood every time I walk in.
4,"Fantastic Aussie brunch spot! Great service, coffee, tea, baked goods. Absolutely delicious!"
3,Sorry to read the bad reviews as we loved this place.  We stopped on our was from Santa Barbara and we we not disappointed.   The shrimp enchiladas were amazing and we will definitely stop in again.
3,"Fun specialty drinks, good comfort food, and great service. We enjoyed the drink specials too. I will be back for sure!"
4,Arrived in town late and looking for something on a Thursday night. Came across this and so glad we did!  I had the Redfish and it was perfect. Also recommend the shrimp jambalaya. Highly recommend this place.
4,"Being a Real Estate agent, the home inspection process can be the most stressful part of the transaction for both the Buyer and the Seller. Mike is so thorough and takes the time that most inspectors won't to answer ANY question either a Buyer or Seller may have during the inspections. He helps our clients feel comfortable during this high stress point of the transaction. I refer all my clients to Mike, weather they are buying a home or looking to get their home ready for the market. Trust me you won't be disappointed in the Hardest working Inspector out there!"
3,"I added two stars from the first time I visited here in June. My girlfriend and I stopped by late one weekday evening and the kitchen was almost closed. However, the staff didn't make us feel rushed other than encouraging us to at least get our order in. We decided to share three appetizers which were all huge portions: barbeque nachos, chicken quesadilla and fried pickles. The quesadilla was good but we really loved the pickles and nachos."
4,"They call it the best because it is very good food the 
Rice is buttered as well the chicken is very fresh 
I love it everytime I'm in town"
3,"Good Pizza, good service
However very difficult to find with the road construction going on.  I found this place through an advertisement in my hotel room. Might be a good idea to put signs on the through streets so people unfamiliar with the area can find you."
0,Do not come at lunch if you are on a limited time frame.  What a mess!!!! 15 min to order and 20 min to get food. Never again for me
0,I came down with toenail fungus after my last Pedi there.  Doctor says that I will be dealing with this now for about a year for it to go away. Will not go there again.
4,There were three of these places we considered while in the quarter the other day. We chose this one by chance and glad we did! My friend got a chair massage for 10 min and said it was perfect. I chose the 20 minute foot massage and it was incredible. Great prices!! Will definitely be going back.
0,I have to say I was shocked to pay 14 dollars for lettuce. The portions were also very small for the price. Not worth it.
0,Went to this restaurant today for a Lg stewed chicken platter and it was horrible. Everything tasted as if it was cooked days before and just reheated. This is the 2nd platter that I've had that tasted like this. I will not be returning.
4,Amazing and family owned so I met the owners and they are kind and explain everything so well!!!!!!!!!!
0,"This place has 3 months to live. It has been a stricken by a horrible disease...complete lack of character and differentiation. Actually, if you like a really quiet place with a subpar wine and beer list...this is the place for you. The Bulldog next door has a better selection of wine and obviously beer. If the owners happen to read this, I strongly recommend investing in some unique wines and not the stuff you can get at any local grocery store."
0,"Contacted Samsung about a service request under warranty. Service assigned to Mr. Appliance. Mr. Appliance never contacted me to arrange an appointment. Samsung contacted me today and informed me this company canceled the service request. Shelby of Mr Appliance was very rude to me on the phone and told me I should wait to hear from them. Well, that call never came. Very unprofessional.  At least show some courtesy and tell me you don't want to repair a fridge under warranty."
3,The employees are super friendly and the store is very busy. The produce is average. They have a nice cheese selection.
1,"The sushi really is NOT GOOD. I've eaten here more than once, trying to give it the benefit of the doubt. The krab rangoons and mochi are pretty good, but when it comes to sushi, it will most likely DISAPPOINT."
3,This is close for us so we order carry out a lot.  Service is so friendly and the atmosphere is very cool.  The food is very interesting.  If you are a basic eater this place not for you.  Menu serves up a twist of ingredients in every dish.  Look close and ask a lot of questions.  Booths by the bar need foot rest.
4,"My wife and each had the Whitefish last night and it was 
excellent as were the green beans."
4,Well run business that cares with friendly staff! Affordable prices and great people!
4,"Great buying experience, everyone was very friendly and attentive. See Jake for your buying needs, he goes above and beyond to please. I can't speak to the service dept yet, but we'll see!"
4,"Had a quick birthday lunch here for my fiance. We ordered the salad special: shrimp and strawberries with lemon vinaigrette, the pistachio crusted chicken tenders and a braised beef sandwich. All excellent. The salad was gigantic, made for 3 meals! I always love coming here."
3,"I haven't returned to DiBruno since my last visit, but I received a message from the manager, who assured me that he spoke with the employee and hopes the situation won't happen again. Given the excellent customer service and my happiness with their store and products aside from this experience, I am happy to up my stars."
3,"Very comfortable. Great service. Exceptional food and drinks. 
I recommend the calamari and skirt steak tacos on the appetizer list. 
Very clean bathrooms and kitchen."
4,"We always give restaurants a 2nd chance, and I'm very glad we did!  Our server was very attentive, and aware our previous visit hadn't gone well.  That said, the Giggle Melt's amazing reputation was well lived up to, and I've been craving another, ever since.  Not a margarita girl, but this one was fantastic!  Will definitely recommend, and return."
4,Excellent service and breakfast . Fairly priced too   Crab cake Benedict was fantastic !
2,"nuthin-ta hate,
nuthin-ta like,

between Havana and the local bar, 
if you asked me what kind of paradise this was, 
this is about your average weekend when you wake up to the sound of gardeners and their weedwackers."
4,"We had an amazing birthday meal that brought me right back to my Asian travels. The Satai was great, and all dishes were served with details that u would only find in Asia generally. Great authentic drinks as well. For desert we had Kaya toast, which is the Jam that I miss terribly and have friends bring every time they come to visit. But best of all, the customer service was impeccable , waiters competent and friendly, and the owner was at the restaurant connecting with her customers and making sure all was going well. Looking forward to returning."
2,"Some days this is worth four stars. Today it was worth three stars.
I used to eat at Black Bear Diner a lot more. I went in today and got the $7 New York Steak breakfast. 
The steak wasn't bad, but really you could tell it was part of a $7 New York steak breakfast special. And I think they cooked it in A-1 Sauced. The eggs and potatoes were standard eggs and potatoes. 
Service was good."
2,Breakfast and lunch food are good. Good also for wifi. Parking is off street and decent.
3,"Awesome joint right on State Street that will give In-N-Out a run for its money any day.  The burgers seem fresher, larger patties, and the FRIES are golden-brown crispy.   And as in some of other reviews, the onion rings are AWESOME.  Overall a cheap, quick, and great tasting burger joint.

Keep in mind The Habit in SB is outdoors only (like you wouldn't mind the awesome weather in SB)."
4,"Well, you know the mantra, New Yorker visiting Tucson and there's no better pizza than in Brooklyn but Pizzeria Bianco is right up there.  Incredible crust, ingredients totally first
class, and an  awesome staff.  We had Jason, the manager give us
the run down on the Bianco story  along with Marlene, consummate bar keep made for an excellent night out.  ps-  desert a must!!  Sidenote=  bathrooms, which in my opinion will tell you right away how a place is run, were spotless!"
0,"The website states that walk-ins are welcome.  Not the case.  Some lady was very nasty to those of us in line, and said they do not take walk-ins. They need to get their information right.  Also, they have appointment times listed, and they are always full, no matter how far out you go.  Over the years, we have used various Quest locations, and never have experienced this type of treatment."
4,"They have wonderful vegetarian tacos! Get the burrito, with beans as the protein, and you will absolutely love it. Everything is so fresh and hot!"
4,While in New Orleans for JazzFest we asked around about finding the best seafood.  Acme oyster was always everyone's first response.  After getting back from the fest on Saturday we decided to give it a try.  The line was already back to Bourbon St but we stuck it out and about 45 min later we were eating the best chargrilled oysters ever!! So glad we didn't let the line scare us away!  We will be back!!
3,"She did a nice job on taking in a couple shirts and hemming some pants. Nice lady, nice job. And the cost seemed pretty reasonable too. Next time I have some alterations, I'll be bringing it to Rita's."
4,"Shamrocks is the one place I go to every time I fly into Florida! The best burgers, wings, and vibe in town. Everyone is friendly, the food is great, and the drinks are perfectly made. Always a 5 star in my book!"
4,"Some of the best tacos I've ever had. They have a good selection that you can have in a taco, burrito, salad, or bowl. All ingredients are fresh and they put your order together quickly. People who work there are really friendly as well. Every time I'm in the area I make a couple stops here for tacos."
4,"WOW!!!! Found this gem from my GF app, as we are in from Illinois. The atmosphere, food, baked goods and of course service from Hector ""The Protector"" was over the top! Pricing was very reasonable, and the quality of the serving was outstanding! Even if you're not GF, this is the place for breakfast! I haven't had a ""real"" breakfast burrito in years, and this one took the proverbial cake!!!!"
0,Your drive thru window girl just handed me my bag without even looking at me then shut the window in my face!!!! All i wanted to ask is if i could have a sweet n sour sauce! Ive never in my life
0,"We were referred to Solar via Samsung for our washer repairs. It took 3 days for them to come out and 5 minutes to read the error code and order the part. One week later they come back, install said part and the same error code and alarm continue. We are now being told that the ""wrong part"" shipped and that it will be another week. When I initially called, I told them the error code that was being displayed. I am extremely disappointed in the service and attitude that we have been shown, and will sell the machine before calling them again to repair anything."
4,We were driving in from out of town. On out way to another breakfast spot we come across this little place. We decide to circle the block and enjoy out breakfast here. So happy we did. The atmosphere is friendly and inviting. The $5 breakfast deal including coffee is perfect. Don't quote me on it but I believe that deal is only until 9am. The prices of other breakfast items were also reasonable. What sealed the deal for my return? Out waiter asked if we wanted a to go cup of coffee at no charge. Yes please! Definitely returning on our next visit to Philly!
4,"Michael did a great job, very informative. Walked away with lots of knowledge about the history of the city."
4,"My dryer stopped heating just as I was trying to dry my second load of laundry.  I immediately called Aviv Appliances, since I had  used them before. The kind and efficient service man was there the next day, quickly diagnosed the problem and, because a part had to be ordered, returned the following day to install the part. I have had to deal with rude and unprofessional repair services before. Thank goodness for Aviv. They are kind, very professional, reliable  and know what they are doing. What a breath of fresh air!"
3,"Who doesn't love a good lemonade stand?! These have the tastiest lemonade in the city. Mmm.... It's perfect on a summer afternoon. They also have smoothies and food there as well. If you're thirsty, check out Lemonade Parade!"
3,I love all the Los Agaves locations but this one seems to be a bit less busy and staff is very friendly and competent. Love the beef chimichanga!
3,"Cool spot to grab some not-so-overly-priced but still good drinks with friends, very backyard bar vibe, games & picnic tables--nothing fancy but cool spot to just hangout with friends and be outside"
3,This is my standard pho place in Chinatown. I love how fast and reliable their service is. Great place to come for a quick dinner/lunch with great pricing.
4,Craving a hot dog and came to the right place.  Came to the right place! Tons of options with quality dogs. Friendly staff. TVs going. RC cola and Diet Coke in the fountain. Corn dog was awesome.
4,"Great pub food - a variety of all types of offerings from unique salads (I had the Greek shrimp) to pizza to burgers and more. Good quality, portion sizes and an amazing selection of beers!"
4,"Waited in line awhile (~45 minutes) on a Friday night, but the food was worth it. Hot chicken was delicious - tender, juicy, well seasoned, very crisp skin. I was skeptical - figured ""hot"" chicken would just be fried chicken with Texas Pete dumped on it, but it's prepared differently (in a good way) than Buffalo wings. Sides - collard greens and beans were awesome - traditional Southern style.  Super busy place, very crowded, but the service was great. I forgot to order a side, but was able to add it without any hassle."
2,"This popular seafood stop has the cutest parking lot that I have ever seen! It has bistro lights strung throughout the trees! Unfortunately, the parking lot was probably my favorite part of the whole establishment. I had P.J.'s Super Combo which included a lobster tail, snow and dungeness crab, broccoli, garlic bread, and french fries. The lobster was a little overcooked and rubbery but the crab was good. The service was good but nothing outstanding."
0,"Had a problem with pocket gophers.  They said I had to contact a state conservation guy to get a trap permit.  They acted like the gophers had Ebola virus and didn't want to get near them or talk on phone.

So I solved the problem myself.  I had a mole and gopher problem.  Would have been nice if they were more helpful."
4,Let me tell you about this wonderful father and son team! Lee and Christopher they are the top Jolly Holiday chimney sweepers that brings a smile to your face and warms your heart with giving top notch quality care of their customers. You guys are the BOMB! Highly recommended!!!
1,"I'm sure the furniture they have is very good.  However, most of what they advertise on their website is not there.  I went looking for a futon (mostly because I need a small couch for my very small living room).  Browsing on line, it looked like they had a pretty decent selection.  Going there revealed that they had two: a metal frame or a wood frame.  Which is fine, but not the selection I was expecting."
4,"One of my favorite Mexican places in the area. Best frozen margaritas, enchilada chipotle is my favorite dish! Been coming here for years. Highly recommend!!!"
3,"We have ordered take out from Thai Square several times, its super quick and tasty. Its been a wonderful addition to our neighborhood, I look forward to actually dining there because the atmosphere is super cute!"
4,"I have been going to this cleaner for years and do not have any complaints. I have brought them clothes, bedding, and tapestries, and everything has been returned clean and on time. When I read about people having their $250 shirts ruined at this cleaner, though,  I do have to wonder about the logic of bringing a $250 shirt for a $2.50 cleaning. That being said, I have never had any issues."
3,"Yar
Yar
Yar!

Our friends had a suite, it was suite.

Rooms/Decor, absolutely amazing.

Drank at the bar, good service, I would consider staying here next time."
4,Good beer good food good service. I will be back! Great stop after riding the trails at Avimor!
4,"Stopped here tonight on a whim and so happy I did. This salon is so pretty and clean, and my nails are perfect. Everyone is so friendly and makes you feel comfortable. I don't live in the area but I will definitely make a special trip, it's worth it."
4,"Harvey's is a hidden gem!!! 

This adorable mom and pop deli is hands down one of my favorite places to go for subs/sandwiches. My favorite order is the ""BIG DADDY"" which features roast beef, ham, and turkey. They do not skimp on any of the ingredients, leaving you full and satisfied! Their potato salad is also some of the best I have ever tasted! 

They offer free delivery to the local area and their take out service is so convenient. There are a few tables inside for a dine in option. Harvey, I will be back!!"
4,I am very satisfied with their service. Always very fast. I love the online ordering. Place is clean and in order. Patty and Stephanie have given good suggestions on their best selling foods. The fowl play salad and chicken chipotle sandwich are some of my favorites. Thank you ladies! Keep up the good work!
4,"Best sandwiches I have ever eaten! My new favorite is the Buffalo chicken!!! I don't know how she does it, but every single drop of food there is mouthwateringly delicious!!! SO worth the wait! Great friendly service and very clean!"
4,"This was a surprise! As soon as my husband spotted the huge grill out front loaded with Tri-tip, chicken and ribs, he couldn't pull over fast enough!! 

We ordered the tri-tip along with corn on the cob and a side of rice with pico de gallo.  We sat at the tables provided inside, WOW it was cooked to perfection, the pico had a little kick! Everything was delish! 

Nice country market with a good variety!"
0,"This location never gives you the right food. I've given them numerous chances to get it right. They even told me the grape jelly was 'discontinued', which is not true because it's available at other locations. This is on top of always  treating me snobby. Today I got home only to realize they didn't put my chicken sandwich in the bag. I'm done at this location."
0,"I got the worst brazilian waxing. My strip of hair i chose to keep is about an inch to the side on top than the bottom. And it is also much thicker on bottom than top by half an inch. Choppy, not a straight strip,no even lines anywhere. She did not even try to make it even or straight. So disappointed i had to go home and shave it off. Will not be returning and will keep my waxing to local businesses like i should have started with."
4,I really liked staying here.  It is very clean and the staff was friendly and professional.  It's nice that it is near a grocery store and coffee shop.  The only negative thing that I can say about this place is that it is too expensive for economy lodging.
4,"Always my go to when I need a sushi takeout night. The service is amazing, the staff is very nice, and the food is delicious! Don't judge this place based on its exterior - I promise it won't disappoint!"
3,"Went here after reading about them on Yelp. Walked in and waited way to long to be acknowledged at the counter. After we placed our order the service was better. Food was good, fried were awesome, kaboom sauce was HOT but so good.  Wish they had fried onions on the menu, but lots of other things to choose from. Average place but will go back, hopefully will get the service that others on here spoke of."
4,"My husband and I decided to head over to the city for a late lunch. It was Saturday and we wanted a salad and a nice glass of wine. When we yelped nice places for lunch that had a decent wine list every restaurant closed at 2pm or 3pm. Couldn't believe it! So we decided to just yelp wine bars and hope that they had something to eat. Well, we hit the JACKPOT! Good wine, nice salad, great plate of cheese, wonderful customer service and awesome music. We will differently be going back."
4,We love Sans pizza this place is like home. Being from the North finding his location was a blessing. Bring all my friends and all company any chance I get. Would rate this a 10 being excellent. Also my wife loves the lasagna he also has other meals. Awesome.
4,Another very good meal Salmon was perfect and the spagetti & meatballs always good. Bartender Neal is a trip. You have to stop in and ask him to show you pictures of his son. Lee and I love going there.
4,"Displaced Bostonian here, best pizza I have had in over 40 years....outstanding.  Looking forward to my new favorite pizza place."
0,"This used to be our go to spot for pizza, wings, cheesesteaks etc. However, they will not get another dollar from me! Ordered chicken tenders on Halloween before taking the kids trick or treating, got home and opened them to find burnt chicken! Called to tell them and to get another order and received a hard time. Was told that they would send out more, which never came. Thanks for the horrible customer service, from a family that used to order at least once every two weeks! NEVER AGAIN...I'll be sure to tell all my neighbors also!"
3,"Great location right on state st. 

Food is pretty average. What you would expect from most any Thai restaurant. However, I tried the crispy garlic tofu and was blown away. A garlic lover's dream. 

Service was very quick , but the ambiance isn't all too exciting. Reasonable price for reasonable Thai food."
4,Lovely place with great service from a family operation. Moncef acts as maitre d' and Jamlila cooks lovely dishes. Good on street parking with seating inside and out. Would go back in a heartbeat.
4,"Awesome spot for all types of food. They will go out of their way for delivery if it's out of their area. They take care of any problems or concerns you might have. I can't say enough good things about them. Have been ordering takeout and delivery for over a year and never had one bad experience. Hard working, dedicated, determined, and committed describes these guys. Generous amounts of food for fair prices! Highly recommend! I have my family and friends hooked!"
3,This is a great local seafood place. The mussels marinara was great.  Tasty shrimp and crab.  They also have Philly cheesesteaks.  Don't miss the salad topped with French fries.
3,"It was some of the best service I have encountered.  They were very busy and everyone did their best to help each other.  The food was very yummy., authentic, warming and well apportioned.  I would return here with my family anytime.  The salsa was delicious.  The kids ate their dinners right up. I would recommend!"
3,"Great new place. Atmosphere is excellent on the inside. My kids seemed to enjoy the food. Mine wasn't bad either. It seemed like they need more staff, but maybe they were just trying to get the hang of things. I'll be coming back to try out more food from this place."
4,Incredible poke-- very fresh and tasty! The wood fired pizza had great flavor. Highly recommend!
4,Ate breakfast here this morning.  Food amazing.  Staff wonderful.  Love this place and will keep coming back!
3,"I thought it was very good. We had a group of 7 and we got two combo A's. This sufficiently fed all of us. One thing to prepare for, if you're bringing a big group that plans on paying separately, you'll likely have to split up the bill yourselves. We had one friend get the 100$ bill and we just had to Venmo her since the checks weren't split. All in all, the food was good, it's a good experience for a special occasion, but definitely a big over-priced."
1,"Overpriced decent wine. They're charging top dollar for 'ok' wines you can't find elsewhere. Not good enough.   If I'm going to pay $18-$20 a glass I want to see some Cru Classe Bordeauxs or 1er Cru Burgundies, not a Syrah from St Joseph or a Cabernet blend from Provence.  Won't return unless they start incorporating wine flights. ONLY way to make it if you plan on competing in a sea of wine bars that offer such."
3,"What a great place this was to watch the total solar eclipe on August 21st! Laid back on the expansive uncrowded lawns by the Mansion and watched nature's most spectacular show unfold. It was totally (pun intended) awesome despite clouds threatening briefly to ruin it.  Carriage ride was a lot of fun, liked the guide. Only gets four stars because there were no souvenirs of the Eclipse on sale in the gift shop. If you guys have a marketing Dept. fire them all for the missed opportunity!"
4,"i was invited @ the old location before they even opened
the Rolling Stone magazine said there was more hugging there than back stage @ the Academy Awards
if they had started with reality shows here, it would still be running!
you'll meet the most interesting people here"
4,"We have had our two rescue dogs cared for by Dr Quartuccio for about 8 years. He is exceptionally compassionate as well as being very well up to date in veteranary science and medications. He will search current reseach findings on particular problems to arrive  at a thorough diagnosis and always considers the psychological effects it may have on the animal. He's smart, compassionate and he takes time to listen. You can't ask for more"
4,"These guys were awesome. Katie answered the phone was super nice from the get go. Very pleasant and laughing. Especially considering I was calling with an insane request for them to do a last minute engraving in less than 10 hours and overnight. Like a lot of blockhead husbands, I waited to the last second to finish my anniversary gift and these guys helped me take it over the line. Totally awesome service with a smile. First rate!"
4,"Hands down this is my favorite day spa. I've tried their massages, facials, and medical treatments; all have been blissful experiences. The sauna in the women's changing area is an added bonus. Dr. Perkins and his staff are extremely friendly, professional and talented. I would definitely recommend Evolutions to a friend."
2,Clean and easy to navigate.  Not a whole lot of amenities. The only real way to get here from Center City is via cab which can be a pain.
0,Stopped in PDQ and the drive up line was arouud  the building.  Popped inside and saw this in the cooking area.  If PDQ stands for People Desire Quality I would have to say you failed. Maybe not so much the dirty condition but buns on the floor!!??  Seems like the employees or some of them are preoccupied with their cell phones or something else.  Manager needs to take note!
4,"Amazing, fast food! Their sopas and tostadas are good but their tortas milanesa are amazing!!!! Horchata is great, a little too much cinnamon but great all around."
0,"We bought all our kitchen appliances through Lake appliances, way before the pandemia, it took them over 5 months to deliver a hood that came defective, their service is more than slow, the hood and range we received - high end supposedly - both defective-, they lied on the repairs they said and the compensation they'll make, very unprofessional, unreliable. I would not recommend them."
1,"Save your money and find somewhere else!
I've never posted a review until today. 

We ordered curb-side via very nice web order process. After driving 20minutes home:
Missing side
Missing potato toppings
Received Rare steak when ordered Medium Well
Chicken dry over cooked 
Kids fries were scorched burnt 
Baked potato way over cooked
Hair in salad topping cup. 

Manager was super nice on the phone and refunded the price of our meal. The reason for 2 stars."
2,"Mediocre service, very slow with food and unapologetic.  Alleged spicy Korean ketchup with tater tots tasted like Heinz straight out of bottle.  Not bad, but not special.  Blue crab spaghetti was almost inedible to saltiness; only ate it because late service left no other dinner options.  Five menu items not available.  Based on other reviews, must have been an off night.

After I posted my initial review the restaurant reached out to make things right, which I appreciate."
4,Yummy! Yummy! Yummy! The strawberry pancake is to die for!!! The Biscuits and Gravy are really good too!!! We go here for breakfast every time we are in town.
4,SUSHI FRIES ! that's all I have to say ... also they have out door seating staff is friendly and try the Ybor cali roll wow they have a forever customer
3,"Came here for my fiance's birthday so she could get her free grand slam breakfast.  This Denny's was great the staff was very tentative and always there when you needed something.  I got the make your own grand slam, which is more than enough food to eat.  I tried the turkey bacon and it was delicious  it tasted just like regular bacon but it is more healthy for you.  If I go back to a Denny's I will definitely come back to this one."
0,Poor service. Front counter young person is very rude and have poor demeanor. And didn't even washed hands to prepare the food after handling register and broom/dustpan.
1,"Disappointed  delivery was over an hour so the food ordered was extremely unappealing ""COLD """"."
4,"City house was amazing. Staff is friendly and helpful, and the hostel nightly events are free and a great way to meet people to be social in a city that you are visiting. The facilities were clean and everything we expected. You could tell that the staff genuinely wants everyone to have a great time and does their best to make sure it happens"
3,"My boss is a big Triple D fan so he was aware of this place from a previous visit. Blackened cat fish was good as well as the jambalaya. The frog legs tasted like, well you know, and their service was quick."
3,"This long, narrow restaurant serves up some wonderful dishes. I would have given it five stars except for one thing: a Ketel One martini cost $12--unheard of!"
0,Absolutely horrible.  The people are extremely rude. Do not waste your money on these ass holes.
2,"I liked this place, never been here before. The food was good, a little overpriced but the waitress was very kind. Will probably go back but not real often. They are relatively new (6 month old) I had a Mac & Cheese lunch it was good! I would say try it at least once!"
4,"Tijuanna flats is my favorite place, so I was happy I found this hidden gem thanks to Yelp! It was great service and the food was awesome as always! You get a lot of food so be prepare to eat yummy food!"
0,"Ironic that this is posted to their menu. As an executive who is focused on best in class service, they are not living what they post. When asked if we could order prior to our group showing, due to having to attend my fathers funeral, our server rolled his eyes and asked if we knew it was the weekend. When the manager on shift was approached, he had the similar attitude. We simply asked to begin the order. 
If you print ""tell a human not a follower"" truly make it your mission. Simply printing it doesn't stop a bad social review."
2,Decent donuts but honestly not the best in town. We had a variety dozen and the donuts were good. The ones I had you could kinda taste the fat or grease honestly don't know. But considering donuts never go uneaten in my house and I threw away 4-5 donuts it says something.  I much prefer Doughboys or Donut Bistro
0,"Ordered takeout about 30 minutes before closing, got a burrito and the green enchiladas both with shredded chicken. Despite being very hungry, we did not enjoy the food. Don't know what happened here but the food was awful. Worst mexican food I have ever had. I recommend El Comalito Mexican Taqueria if you are looking for something close to town"
3,I'm from CA and our nail salons have not yet opened so I was really happy to hear I could get a pedicure when visiting idaho. We were able to make an appointment and only waited a few minutes after arriving to be seated. The salon was clean. I opted for a gel pedicure but wasn't given an option on what type of pedicure. It wasn't the best massage but it was good. $45 later I am happy with the outcome.
2,"Chilis is chilis, the nice thing is you know what to expect. The burgers here are solid, I like mine with bacon and cheddar cooked medium. Somehow, they always manage to cool the burgers perfectly which is why they taste so great. I also like the desserts like the molten cake, warm chocolate cake with caramel, fudge, and ice cream. The bad thing is service can be hit or miss depending on the server."
4,"Best ribs I've had hands down. They were at BNBNBBQ this year, first time I actually tried them. Love the Texas hot sauce, Mac and cheese is fir. Not only will I be coming back but can't wait to!"
3,"I really enjoyed my experience at Liberty and looking forward to getting back. I came from NJ to check it out and it was well worth it. Great selection at the bar, friendly staff and good food."
4,"Anthony's crew showed up promptly, and were very time-efficient. They did a great job repairing repairing some water damaged plaster in my home. Pricing was fair, and the whole team was honest and friendly."
4,I absolutely loved having breakfast at Clear Sky Cafe. The menu truly had something for everyone. I got stressed out at one point because too many dishes sounded good. I settled on the Seafood Crêpes. They were phenomenal. The chef drizzled mornay sauce on top. Everyone in my family loved their meal. I will certainly return whenever I go back to Clearwater.
1,Not a big selection of different types of beer. Dude behind bar had no personality- maybe that is his personality. Oh well- it was Octoberfest when we were there. Not crazy busy inside. Maybe better when there isn't an event.
4,"Just arrived Tucson to visit family for a week. Delicious food! Carmen our server was the best and so fun, she knows the menu well, the Salted Spicy Chicken is the best, it was all really good. Enjoyable atmosphere, comfortable seating. Thank you Carmen for an enjoyable dinner, we'll be back before we leave"
3,"I have lunch here a couple times a month and it's good. Friendly service. I was shocked to see another reviewer found a caterpillar in their food! OMG!

I have never found anything foreign in my meals there."
4,"I ordered take-out sushi with my brother and boyfriend and we tried more rolls...everything was phenomenal and the boys were both impressed with the quality and flavor of the sushi. We tried: the sweet potato roll (HIGHLY RECOMMEND), blue crab roll, spider roll, lobster roll, bagel roll, Tokyo roll, the Ladies roll, Key West roll, and an order of the blue crab Rangoon which was delicious and flaky! If you are looking for excellent sushi in the area, this is it!"
4,"Me and my wife love this spot. Can honestly say we haven't had a bad meal, they have an amazing selection of beers, and their cocktails are can't-miss.

Highlights: Wings, fries (angry or sexy), and all of their fish entrees (salmon, swordfish, mahi mahi, etc.)

Great service, talkative bartenders, and never too long of a wait, no complains here!"
0,"Pizza good, wait time atrocious. You could walk to New York and come back with food before this dominos would deliver yours."
3,"This post office is in a great location!!! The people are friendly and "" human "" very nice pleasant experience. I'm talking about the boutique on Lakeside!!!"
3,"Made fresh everyday.  Cupcakes are good, and the frosting isn't too overly sweet.  The champagne and wedding cake taste similar in my opinion with the only real difference is the frosting."
4,This was my first time coming to Ferino. Such a cool distillery. We came on a slow Sunday night but we had a great time talking to the bartender kevin. He was super nice and very knowledgeable. Our drinks were great and also got to taste the three things they distill. My favorite one was the cinnamon one. We will be back soon to try other cocktails and bring our group of fiends.
4,They have a coffee stand at Curtis HU on waterfront park. Good prices for large portion! Friendly staff
4,"My boyfriend and I were visiting from Connecticut and found this place on line.  We decided to go in to get some cupcakes after dinner.  We were greeted warmly by Camille who described each cupcake.  Needless to say, we bought more than expected and the cupcakes and customer service did not disappoint.  We bought a house in the area and this will be our go to for cupcakes and ice cream.  YUMMY"
4,"First time in Nashville and we got very lucky. It was Tuesday and we only waited 10 minutes, without reservations. 
The cocktails were very strong, but good...very good. Atmosphere for 10.
Service was even better....but the food...WOW!!! I ate at Michelin restaurants, but I never had a meal as delicious as here. 
Had to come back a week later for more. 
Very highly recommended"
3,"Parking can be a bummer sometimes, but the Flying Saucer is the place to go to when you're looking to try something different! The interior is so interesting and different from other bars, and their pretzels are a must. Seriously."
2,"Went to Spyce 28 for dinner this past Sunday, the food was OK the happy hour drinks and appetizers were OK nothing great. We had the chicken stirfry which was tasty and a fairly generous portion."
3,"i like spicy food, the shrimp cocktail was the megalodon of spicy food. However, its not habenero spicy more like wasabi spicy.. if you know what I mean. My shrimp cocktail consumption involved me eating a shrimp, crying for 1 to 2 minutes... repeat until it was gone. Maybe best to share this with someone and eat one or two shrimp. 
Filet was also very tasty, not a huge fan of the creamy spinach, however, if you are sick of chain restaurants this place is great."
4,"This place rocks for pizza, burgers and beer.  Everyone is nice.  We triedbit out of the blue and will be back. Indoor and outdoor seating."
0,"They will take advantage of you every chance they get. They give you sales men that do not know much bought what they are selling. I would not recommend going here. They told me everything I wanted would be on the Jeep I payed for. Told me it had to be delivered from another dealer ship had me sign all the paper work then when it go here it did not have everything we agreed on.  They then told me it is what I agreed to. 
Bate and switch big time."
4,"Great little place. Seafood i got was super fresh. Best crab cake I've had in a long time. And just a great atmosphere, it's exactly what i was hoping to find in santa barbara!"
2,"All I ever want when I stay at a hotel is quiet, comfortable bed, and cleanliness. This hotel was clean, but the pillows were bowling ball shaped and oober uncomfortable. We also heard a lot of street noise through our window. The temperature in the room also did not adjust properly. But it was a good location."
4,"My family has been regulars here since they opened, and I have been going there since it used to be called Peking. The General Tso Chicken is the best around. It is my favorite dish and I have tried at many other Chinese food places, but there is no other Chinese place that I have found yet that makes it quite like Tokyo does. Great staff, service, and food."
4,"Visited Freret Beer Room last weekend and will definitely be back. The staff/owners were top-notch and the food was reliably notable. The beer selection was just right- something for everyone, and the bartenders were incredibly knowledgeable of the options. I was fortunate enough to try several items on the menu and everything I had was amazing. Highly suggest ordering the mussels. They were some of the best I've ever had. Check this place out. You will not be disappointed!"
4,"never had thier drinks, but the burgers are amazing! btw they cook them infront of you!!"
0,Extremely salty. I really like salt but yuck! It wasn't just the rub they use. I had the brisket and ribs combo. Couldn't eat it unfortunately.
4,"I brought my 2014 Elantra in because I thought the rear end was out of alignment, because tires had worn prematurely.  Turns out if it was, there would be a tremendous cost to fix because it is not made to be adjustable.  The service department did alignment measurements and road tests, did not find a problem.  Previously, I had been told the test would cost be $125 and I could apply that to a repair if I had it done.   After finding nothing wrong, they refused to charge me anything.   This really made my day!   Any future repairs I need will be done at Ray Brandt!"
3,Ramen sho is the most authentic Japanese ramen I've found in Idaho. After spending 4 years in japan it was really refreshing to have a nice hot bowl of ramen. They also feature a variety of authentic and unique Japanese flavors of ramen including curry ramen (one of my personal favorites). The only downside was that the pork they serve didn't fall apart in my mouth. It was a little bit too chewy for my taste and slightly below my expectation but it was still delicious.
4,"Superlative. Such a hidden gem and well worth the drive from Princeton. Will be back often. Great food, wine and music."
0,Came into the dealership with hopes of purchasing a vehicle and possibly even working as a technician here. Was greeted with a rude demeanor. As a potential customer I did not feel welcomed. Will not be shopping here in the future.
4,I read reviews before came but those reviews were right!! Best beignets ever!! Flaky beignets like croissant and buttery and creamy praline stuffing inside.  I would say better than cafe de mondo beignets.  I was there Christmas Eve so I didn't expect they were open but they were.  I got yummy praline and best beignets.  I should get savory one too.  But maybe next time
4,"This is my ""go to"" spot for lunch.  Easy online ordering and pickup.  The custom roll option is awesome and the sushi ingredients are always fresh.   Very friendly staff as well."
4,"Been here only once. Good transaction, no issues, etc. (Was for my vehicle safety inspection.)"
2,"The decor is super dope. The food is over priced for what you get, in my opinion. The tacos are fairly tasteless. However, the cheese dip and the nadarita are both bomb.com. Would recommend getting reservations over the weekend!"
4,"Had the calamari, cornish hen, and Nutella cannoli. It was all on point.  Service was excellent. Byob just added to the experience. I will be back."
4,"It was my wife's birthday last week and she wanted to do something fun. SB Art and Glass was great. Saul is a great host and teacher. He is patient but also encourages you to ""go for it"" and push yourself. The funk zone style studio was inspiring and we learned a lot. I'd recommend trying a class in a second. We were (are) complete novices but with his help made 2 really nice pieces each and some great memories."
4,"We stopped in this quaint little place for drinks and what a gem! The staff was so friendly! The owner came over to our table and gave us tons of different suggestions for places to visit in Nashville while we are here. We didn't have the food, so we can't comment on that, but the drinks were great and the staff friendly!"
0,The kids have fun skating but when I'm sitting in this place I break a sweat. I'm NOT skating. It's like 80 degrees inside. It's ridiculous!
4,"Overall, this is the best Indian restaurant in Tucson(and I have tried each of the others over the past 8 years I've been here!). I have dined at tamarind a few times now, and they have been pretty consistent in their food quality.

Pros:
Ambience
Full Bar
Food quality
Buffet (on Sundays)
Service

Cons:
Little far(especially if you are in the east side of the town)
Little pricey 

Their goat biryani is nice(especially the presentation). But, everything else on the menu also tastes good."
4,Best tattoo artist ever and I love Jesse and family we're always around the area supporting the small businesses definitely check it out
1,"Sushi Haru is very cute and pleasant on the eye.    The decor is great!   

The sushi isn't the best I've ever had.   On a really good day, it's ok.  On a bad day, it's awful.    Due to the price and quality, I can't justify returning."
0,"Was harassed by one of the workers. did not get his/it's name but he was a heavy set dude that kept calling me ""partner"" like some cowboy."
4,"Absolutely love Tupelo Honey! The vibe is so laid back and the food and drinks are delicious! I especially like their mimosas, and the sweet and spicy chicken sandwich. Their biscuits and potato cracklins are also worth mentioning (yum)!"
0,Visited this establishment bc I had a Groupon. Service was slow but the server seemed to have bar responsibility and about five tables. Ordered a burger w onion rings. It took forever  to be delivered and it was cold so I sent it back. It came back and it was obviously microwaved including the lettuce and the onion rings had been placed back into the fryer so they were disgusting. Now that was unacceptable!!! My husband never got his sweet potato fries redone as requested so he couldn't eat his burger. We ended up leaving. Never again.
3,Lunch service is very good. Easy menu. Excellent choices. Terrific service. Love the French press coffee. Our group was happy with the experience.
2,Darn good bagels.  Substantially cheaper by the box--consider your options carefully since a schmear (LOVE it) doubles the cost of your delicious carb-indulgence.
2,"Stopped by for a quick coffee and snack. A typical DD with Baskin Robins inside. I do love glazed blueberry cake doughnut! Cold brew was average, regular coffee was better. Good for quick stop of in a hurry, not very personal. They have putting green outside but looks like the ball would go in the road."
3,"Footlight Musicals is a community theater organization producing around 4-5 main stage productions, a smaller cabaret show and a couple youth productions each year in the Hedback Theater.  They have a real commitment to American musical theater and present mostly well-known classics along with a few recent surprises."
4,This is hands down my favorite restaurant in Boise. My family has been coming here for at least 10 years and it never disappoints. Anything with shredded beef is a good choice and the fajitas are awesome. The staff is always so welcoming and they make an effort to remember you and your order every time.
3,"Really freaking good! Great crust , smelled delicious, and sufficient amount of toppings. Pizza was ready real fast too."
3,"The meat was very delicious. I tried the pork, hot pork, and brisket. Again the meat is bomb. The sides were okay. The sauce was good. Picture is hot pork."
4,"From the excellent service to the great food IDK where to start with this hidden place inside of a hotel! A must go to if your in the downtown CBD area! I found the place on yelp but it need more recognition... IJS! My fave so far is the buffalo frog legs, and they redfish (sum10)! Just go check them out. You won't be disappointed!"
0,"Tried this place for the first time. Very disappointed. The staff was fairly nice, but the food was awful. Too expensive for the quality."
0,"I love their pizza so much. I wish they'd get better service. It takes so long when I go in to get food. Last time they ""forgot"" to put my pizza in. This time they gave it to someone else!! I literally had to wait for them to remake it, SMH!! Come on, I only get an hour for lunch. Ridiculous!!"
2,I'm seeing a lot of very negative reviews about this location sheesh. But I'm here to give you my experience.  Honestly my visit went pretty good. The food was good. I love their spicy chicken and it did not disappoint. The buttery biscuit was delicious mmmm! The only problem I had was the inside looked run down. Like they started to make renovations but then gave up half way. Weird.
0,"Had an appointment for tile cleaning between 8am and noon. No one ever showed up or called to say they were running late. When I called customer service they took my information and said someone would call me back. No one did.
I took an unpaid day off of work for nothing. 
Anyone know of a different tile cleaning company that actually has customer service?"
0,"Horrible! Do not go here.  Had an appointment at 1:40pm and still was waiting at 2:30! It was for my 5 month old, and waiting that long is not good especially when you have an appointment for an infant!  Place was extremely dirty.  I wasted my afternoon and will never go back there again."
0,Double the price of all other estimates- weird attitude very different from other professionals
4,"Good fresh tasting food. I had the chili verde enchiladas- loaded with pork. But the best part of dinner was the sopapillas - hot, light and delicious with just the right amount of honey and powdered sugar. This place is my new go to Mexican restaurant, pity I didn't try it sooner!"
3,The BEST chocolate chip cookies! I love get avocado toast too! Did you know that they also have a key lime daiquiri?
1,Took a detour here last year on a road trip and was very underwhelmed.  For the largest (debatably) mall in America I expected something awesome.  It actually looks like two fairly typical malls side by side instead of one huge mall.  Nothing about the architecture stood out to me which is a shame so my visit was much shorter than planned.
0,What a disappointment. Travelled a pretty good distance to try their pizza and couldn't be more disappointed. The two dolts behind the counter could not have been more ignorant and uninviting. Pizza average at best. Save your money rather than spend it on this sub par service experience.
4,"They do such an amazing job. So detail oriented and above and beyond with their aim to please. The Norton family is so great and relatable. Such a pleasure to work with. It's also so nice to support a small, local family business. I can't think of a single reason to go anywhere else!"
4,We had a very nice experience at this location the food was great and management and staff were friendly and awesome they switched out my soup for me when I didn't like the first one. I would definitely recommend this location.
4,"We enjoyed chips, salsa, chicken chimichanga and wet burrito.  The portions are huge, and super tasty!!! We dined inside, where there is bar seating, and tables along the wall.  Service was fast and friendly."
4,I love the Gumbo shop! I have been here 5-6 times and it never disappoints. The service and food is always outstanding and it seems to be a little quieter than most restaurants in this area. I love their seafood gumbo and fresh bread. I can also recommend their strawberry daiquiri. My husband had their red beans and rice and thought they were great. We also had their corn and crawfish soup and it was amazing. My uncle doesn't eat seafood and said the grilled cheese was excellent.
4,The best meal I've had in awhile. Service was great too! The surrounding area isn't the best but can be overlooked by what they got going on in dat kitchen.
0,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. Place is terrible. I ordered one simple thing. When picking up my food the lady behind the counter had an attitude. Get back to work. My order is completely wrong so I call back and get more Attitude from the same lady. Do not waste ur time
0,This venue is requiring vaccine passports or PCR tests.
3,"My boyfriend and I wanted to watch Everest and this was the only one with a late night show time... The bathrooms weren't very clean and also the theatre seats were DISCUSTING. There were white stains all over the seats which grossed me out to the point that I didn't even want to be there nor touch anything. The movie was great though. I will Def reconsider before returning here.. Westshore is way cleaner, so is Ybor Muvico..."
4,"Food, music, and the ambiance hits all the marks. 
Desiree was our dedicated sommelier. She nailed what we wanted. I can really say thanks to her, my birthday was wonderful. 
Wynonna Judd was just as impressive, lol"
3,"Amber ale = best beer I've had in my life. Excellent burger. Plenty of space, good music, and great staff."
4,"The massage was very good. I did 60 minutes for $50. You can't beat that! The ladies there are friendly and the rooms are clean. I highly recommend this place, and for the price, it's a steal!"
2,"Food was mediocre, not super expensive, but the 45 minute wait for two pizzas and a sub really threw us off. The server was very nice, although visibly annoyed when we walked up and asked to sit outside. 
Not hateful but wouldn't come back."
4,"Don't even live in Florida, my myPanera account was hacked unfortunately but the swift management at this location made sure the money was never debited from my account and canceled the order as soon as I called them to report fraud. Awesome team! Thanks for looking out for your customers!!"
1,Catchup is sour and the dogs are overpriced and the fries have too much artificial seasoning on them.
4,This place is a small and private restaurant that they can personalize your every need. I love this place so much! The owner is super nice and enjoy serving the freshest seafood. He made sure we are satisfied with the food and the service. Every slice of fish was cut with precision! Never frozen that's most important! This has just became my favorite Japanese restaurant. The prices are very reasonable and considering that it is located in center city. A must visit in my opinion!
4,So delicious. I had the fish special. Beautiful outdoor seating. Will definitely go back. Good service too.
0,"This company must water down there pesticide because Stinkbugs came  back the next night, after they sprayed , I called and they came back to spray outside and 2 days later bugs came back and tonight a bug is walking on TV, I better get up a kill it
Good job Pioneer"
3,"Great pizza. System you would think more efficient with all the volume they do. They have to cross over each other too much. Making it slow and jerky. Good price, friendly and quality."
2,"I've heard a lot about this place as I am a UT student. The food was not very good. Me and my friend took a whole pizza, and it was huge! Never seen something so big ! If you are very veryhungry and in a hurry, this might be a good place to eat at. Other than that, it is not worth the try."
3,"Nice, relaxed atmosphere. A nice place to come for pool and drinks with your friends."
4,First time here. The Restaurant is super clean and tidy. Food is so good. I will definitely come back again.
1,Unfortunate experience today. They got too busy and ran out of food. We were the last customers and the owners were obviously frustrated. My father in law went behind the counter to put ketchup in our bag while we were waiting in one more thing. The cook came out to yell at him and I watched him throw something against the wall. Super unprofessional even though he should not have went back there. Won't be back.
0,"This place is run by the most obnoxious group of management I have ever seen
I am not going to go on and on because everyone else did
Elizabeth who rented to me is plain nasty. The current property manager could care less
It has to start at the top
DONT RENT HERE"
1,Very disappointed. Oysters sucked ass. Drinks we good but I won't be going back. Can't believe they have as good of reviews as they do.
4,Great selection. Knowledgeable and friendly staff. Slushees!!  Don't go to Giant. They have enough money and their selection is crap and you are on your own in terms of service. Support these great guys.
4,"Maybe it's because I've been starved for good Asian food for so long, but wow.  Delicious!  My only gripe would be that they really drown the food in sauces. Next time i go, I'll be asking them to take it easy on the sauce. I like to taste the ingredients. With that said, still awesome."
4,Shells was wonderful!  We had their seafood cheese dip which I was skeptical about but turned out very tasty. They were very helpful and accommodating for my husband's celiac (gluten free) needs. They even have gluten free pie coming which we are VERY excited about !  The food was really yummy and fairly priced. Servers were kind and made me feel at ease. I have high anxiety and came at an odd time of day (4:00pm) but the friendliness of the servers and nice clean atmosphere with a wh
3,My new favorite restaurant on warehouse district.  My goodness the cured meats are delicious and the glazed pork belly is to die for. Definitely will come back again. Yummooo!!!
4,"I didn't even like cupcakes before I had cupcakes from the cupcake collection. That's how good these are. Light delicious flavors that send you into a dreamy bliss, rather than a sugary fever. Get there earlier in the day, because they will sell out. EVERY style is delicious, but my favorite is the sweet potato."
2,"I am hoping that items on their ""special"" menu will be available always!

delish drinks, delish turkey burgers, and all around fun
who could turn down a blood orange margarita????
most people rave about the fries-and make it their destination of choice for them"
4,"OMG . I have one thing to say and one thing only , their donuts are amazing and they have such variety  . I got 3 different kinds and all of them were great and fresh . Cheap prices too and excellent customer service . I would definitely go back and I know I will lol"
4,They did a very good job on my eyebrows. I'm pleased! I plan on returning for other services. Not to forget the prices are very affordable!!!
4,"This place is Fire!! We're from Santa Maria and my wife and I were impressed with how the food looked, tasted, it cooks right in front of you too! Such a great experience Kyle and the teams customer service is on point! Great job Uniboil.c"
4,"Great atmosphere, great staff and great prices!  I organized a meetup group here that was supposed to be about 40 people on a Thursday night. They were extremely accommodating and reserved several bar tops for us. While the group ended up being much smaller, the Plough helped us have a great night 

I absolutely recommend this place"
0,"Tom Kha with chicken, Pad See Ew with pork.
The chef doesn't understand meat, both chicken and pork were cut ""With"" the grain, not against. Making the meat impossible to chew and eat.
A lot of money, for a horrible meal"
2,"Place is a little hidden off the Main Street. The beef could have used more of a marinade to season it up  and was a bit tough to chew. The fish taco was good but it didn't haven't the same taste as many California fish taco do, the fish was a thin cut not the full fillet as most California taco shops serve. The chicken taco was alright but like the beef it could have used more marinated to season it's taste. 

The tacos are filling with lots of meat in each one something you don't see very often."
2,"the hair cuts here aren't bad. ive been here once for a trim. they do a decent job.

DONT get your nails done here. i was trying to save time by getting my nails here but it was a bad idea. the institute charges the same price as anywhere else, but my nails were so poorly done that i just left after complaining to the person twice. seriously. dont even consider getting a manicure here. NOT worth it."
0,"Rudest staff ever! They literally don't want to work!. Awful staff, awful owner. Horrible experience, don't come to this awful place."
1,"Going to avoid this airport in the future when possible. Bathrooms running out of toilet paper, multiple restaurants running out of food, flight delayed 2 hours with a changed gate and no notification, intercoms that you can't hear from more than 20 ft away, plane loaded / ready and then we're told that the plane is too heavy to take off. And it's a Monday afternoon!"
4,And just when I thought it couldn't get any better-we now have a bike share program along the Cultural Trail in downtown Indy!! It seems B-Cycle-which was in Chicago a few years before I moved to Indy is now here via The Pacers! While I will probably not use it myself as I own two bikes-it will be great for friends and family that are visiting us! Another reason to love The Cultural Trail!
0,"Terrible service actually got up left , the place was dead and waiter acted like it was a bother to take our order. I paid for the drinks and left went to Kobe steak house and had a great meal."
4,Best bar anywhere. The cocktails are extraordinary. Just tell them what you like and they will create something beyond your imagination.
4,"Every town needs a toy store, but we're lucky enough to have to have the BEST toy store EVER! Unique, super cool selection and FANTASTIC staff!"
4,"This is the best diner for miles. The staff are pleasant, and the food is good. The decor is dated but charming. There is extra parking out back. Look for the big cow statue! Everything is homemade. Can't go wrong."
4,I came here for my birthday! Having never been it truly was the best experience Iv had dinning out in a long time! This restaurant sets the bar for hospitality! Quality! And atmosphere! Was given a birthday card on arrival! Given plenty of information about the menu! They even took our photo and printed it out as a thank you card for our farewell! Came to the table with a tower of delectable sweet dreams in a shot glass! What a perfect way to spend a birthday dinner or for any dinner for that matter! I recommend this restaurant 110%
4,They have good prices and great sushi. Definitely recommend. The dynamite roll is one of my favorites
0,"Walked through the store several minutes and not one sales person, that were standing around, asked me if I needed help.  Hello Raymour and Flanagan!"
3,"A nice stadium with some solid food options (particularly the addicting crabfries). I really love the view of the skyline as the stadium faces toward the central city area. But, parking or finding your uber can be an absolute pain since there are so many venues around and limited parking. Though there is a septa station relatively close by which makes for a pretty easy transportation option."
4,The Bonati Institute was a God send!  Dr. Wolff was incredible as well as the entire staff. I cannot express the life changing difference it has made.
0,The service is here is horrendous. I continually try to give them second chances but they mess up the order 30% of the time. They will sit there and argue with you when it was clearly their mistake. So frustrating. I give up. I advise you not to go there.
4,"We took the Ghost and Vampire tour during our bachelorette trip to New Orleans. Emily, our tour guide, was awesome!! She was very knowledgeable about the history and a great story teller (we loved her blue unicorn outfit too). :-) The size of the tour group was awesome... only like 14 people. Wish there were more vampire stories though!"
4,"Katie who teaches 4:30 bodyworks Tuesday nights ROCKS!!  Motivating, safe and tough.  Pushes you but in a good way"
4,"You know damn well what you're getting when you order from dominos, so this 4 stars is for the service.  Consistently on time, never fuck up my orders, and when I actually tried out one of the carryout deals, they were fucking friendly as hell.  Even let my 2 year old come around back at watch the pizza being made."
2,"I went there today. I feel like it's too over priced for what is there especially the fact that you have to pay for an entrance even if you aren't the one going in the sides. Also, you have to rent ice skates aside if you want to have the chance to ice skate. The slides were pretty fun but for the things they have I feel the prices are too high. There is also a time limit for you to be in there for which I think adds to the bad things. But overall it was an okay experience."
0,"Wow so overpriced, portions are tiny, and takes forever to delivery via Uber Eats. 30 minutes late from said ETA. Expect to pay $17 for pineapple rice! This place is a total rip off. Lots of options for Thai so pass this one by."
4,Definitely is happy with all facets of andys diner.its an excellent place to get a meal
4,Good massage!! First time and I would come again. They welcomed us and took us right away! The foot massage was awesome! I would come back.
4,"Amazing menu, awesome service, delicious beer, vibing atmosphere and (even) kid-friendly! When in town, this is a ""must try"" for true craft brew fans! Five thumbs (stars) up!"
0,"Holy Moly, worst jambalaya I've ever had.  Tasted like rice and tomato sauce.  I should have just gone to the grocery and bought a box of Zatarain's.  Ugh.  Prices aren't particularly expensive, but paying anything for food so terrible is too much.  The bartender was nice enough, but drinks were extremely weak.  In a city of amazing food and strong cocktails, there is no reason to set foot in the place if it isn't four am."
4,"I went for Restaurant Week. I got the steak and tres leches cake. Everything was amazing. Don't get tripped up by the happy hour, though. It does not apply to the dinner seats."
3,"It is a grocery store - I really do not have much to say but I read some negative reviews and had to at least say something.  I have never had anyone be rude or mean to me.  They have always been helpful and incredibly nice.  There are times when the store is busier than others, guess what, it happens.  I shop at ""off times"" and have never had to wait in a long line.  We got my son's birthday cake here and we were super pleased with it."
3,"Update

Still overall a good pizza place, but the food quality has gone down a tad and I've run into a few ordering snafus, so I'm updating my review to reflect that."
4,"YUM! Such a cool place for lunch or dinner, love the atmosphere and the food is great! Staff is friendly!Shrimp and all other seafood is always cooked to perfection! Can't wait to come back :)"
4,i came with a couple friends near close and we were treated really well - the food was good and the hookah was smoother than most. the place was clean and the waiter put up with us not knowing what we wanted. the lounge was really comfy and clean and we'll definitely be coming back !
3,"Portion sizes are large, prices are low, food is decent. I would recommend Zaytoon Grill if that's what you're looking for. I enjoyed it."
0,"Actually didn't eat there - because after waiting in line, we were seated RIGHT at the entrance to the bathroom 

Sorry, but even casual restaurants should do better than that"
4,"I typically don't write reviews and honestly only write them when I have positive experiences. Tonight I could tell the staff was busier than normal and was working hard. I had some difficult questions about a new diet my veterinarian had suggested for my old pup. Lauren, one of the managers, dropped everything she was doing to stop and answer my questions to help me find exactly what I was looking for. Hard to find in big stores like this anymore but don't worry about finding a little personal attention at this Petsmart!"
0,"terrible service. tried to charge me for premium had to go back inside twice, employees standing around with long lines.  16 minutes for a gas  stop, with grocery's in my car. Stick with quickstop or anywhere else"
4,This is one of the best auto repair shops in the area not only is the staff friendly and professional. They look out for your needs first. The knowledge base is amazing such a pleasure to work with.
4,"Wayne did a great job and was very quick and efficient at repairing our AC and also installing our Nest thermostat. No pressure, no sales ploys, and no bs. Just came to get the job done and make sure we were happy. Thanks Wayne!"
0,I didn't like it as much as jimmy John's. The bread was soggy. Meat tasted processed. And just overall gross.
2,"Grabbed a Morton's Prime Burger at the bar the other night. Came as ordered, well done, with a good amount of shoe string fries. Very satisfying. No complaints."
4,Love watching the boat come in and out of this pub. Good food and nice staff. Enjoy anafternoon here.
4,"Had the Le Pig Mac . 2 all pork patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickle + onion on sesame buns. Delicious !"
4,"First time here but definitely there will be more to come , the atmosphere is like a time machine that brings you back to good ole days , the service is amazing because they are all family
Members who have been here 43 years , the food is amazinggggggg. Had the brisket and my friend had the chicken and we both ended up with chocolate cake and key lime pie which was amazing. All this with very responsible prices ."
2,"Ordered takeout from Saritas Grill since it was recommended by the bartender at the Publiq House as solid and satisfying.  Cool big yellow box of a building steps away from .... everything on Freret Street.  10 fast minutes later, I picked up the food from a very nice waitress and went back to the bar.  Would like to dine in next time as the indoors has a different vibe.  The food was, indeed, very solid and delicious.  Beans and rice and meats and cheese all good - two different hot sauces included in the bag!  Will be back again."
4,"I've eaten here twice and both times the food and staff have been exceptional. The quality of food is extremely good for the price and the staff is friendly and attentive.  The bone in ribeye, the black and blue salad and crab cakes were all very good and I would order them again but I'm excited to try out what else they have on the menu. I'll be back!"
3,This is such a cute place! It had a quaint feel and the food is so good. It's like eating at a relative's house and getting a home cooked meal while there.
3,The perfect place to open up in Broad Ripple. This is the type of bar/restaurant they were waiting for. Crack fries are delicious and the beer selection is top notch. If you can't find a beer you don't like here then that is unfortunate and you are probably not a beer drinker.
4,"Any time we are in the St Petersburg area, we stop here. Their food is so delicious and fresh! We've tried other taco places in the area but nothing compares"
4,"Incredible experience all around: great food, awesome cocktails, cute decor, safe protocols, terrific staff"
0,"Went over the weekend. This place used to be our weekly hang out. Man, did they go down hill. Bartender was rude. Atmosphere is just blah now. The beer was flat, btw they tell you it's drinkable even id warm or flat.  It is sad when you get better service & beer from a Metairie bar"
1,"Nah this ain't it

Ok products, very unskilled nail techs, owner is brash, probably well meaning but just needs a chill pill."
3,"Joined the Tucson Racquet and Fitness Club as part of my new retirement plan.  I love it!  The facility is clean and well maintained. There are great classes all day long, and the staff is courteous and helpful.  Membership is very reasonable.  I would recommend the Tucson Racquet and Fitness Club for everyone, but especially for seniors."
4,"Delicious!!!! Friendly staff, relaxed atmosphere and amazing tacos...what could be better?"
1,This used to be really good but the last few times I've been I have been disappointed. From the portion size to what should be on the food. Probably won't be going back any time soon. I asked for no chocolate or whipped cream on the churros and what do I find? Chocolate and whipped cream. Do you all not listen to what the customer says? Clearly not. So unimpressed at this time.
4,"Super friendly staff, fantastic meats and sides, clean restaurant, great experience! A few colleagues and I landed at the airport at lunchtime, and this had good reviews... Now I know why!"
4,We love Pueblo Lindo. So happy they opened a place in the Boise area as we've visited them for years in McCall. Great food. Authentic. Good vegetarian options (including rice and beans). Super friendly staff
3,"Tucked away in a corner of the reading terminal, this shop has some really good treats, I love yogurt covered almonds and malted milk balls and other little treats, only drawback is that it is bulk so there are minimums to buy that I am not a fan of."
4,"Delicious! Happened upon this truck and was pleasantly surprised. Hesitant about the price at first but I would have paid more considering the quality, quantity, and general passion the dude seemed to put into it all. Everything was good and tasted fresh/homemade. Service was phenomenal. Went with the pork stack and also tasted my friends sliders; both were stellar! The kettle chips that come with it all tasted homemade too so consider skipping the upgrade to fries. I'll be cutting people off to pull over next time I see this truck."
3,"Just got down from massachusetts and wanted crawfish so bad! So we stopped by here. It was a busy night I get it. we ordered a bunch of crawfish and said it will only be a couple minutes , a couples mins later we were told a couples mins again and so on 45 mins passes and still no order so finally the waiter came out with our order less than what we ordered but at least they didn't charge us.  They're crawfish was the best and delicious we even came the next day for lunch."
3,Service was good. It is what it is. Get the wings and a cold beer and watch the game! There is plenty of seating inside as well as patio seating. Good place to watch the game. I would come back.
4,"This is one of my regular Mexican restaurants of choice. Everyone in my family loves the wet burrito and we get it all the time. Also their margaritas are very good. Strong but not overpowering and lots of flavor options. I love the black raspberry and some of the other berry flavors. Good size and portions for the price! I was so glad to see them get a lot of take out traffic during covid because it would be sad if this place went out if business. 

Staff is friendly and attentive. I have no complaints!!"
4,"Great place.  Walk ins welcome! Clean and the Pedi massage chairs are to die for!! They use an individual plastic wrap on the foot spa bowl!! So no sharing of cotties!!! The leg massage ""hot stone"" with the 35$ pedi was fabulous!!! I will definitely be back and will recommend to all my pedi friends!!"
1,No sure why the rating is high. One of the worst Mexican restaurant we ever been. Salty food and dirty plates.
4,We stayed here while our newborn daughter was stuck in the hospital. We were treated so kindly by the front desk staff and cannot thank them enough for their hospitality and flexibility. The included breakfast was also quite extensive.
1,Technician seemed not to know how to take care of an ingrown nail. Had to wait awhile even though I had an appointment. Massage was pathetic
4,"Michaels is where I get my Spring plants. They are more than helpful and prices are excellent. 
Loved the flowers I ordered for a funeral."
1,"Zoo Boise has one good attraction, giraffe feeding. Other than that, it is tiny and there were hardly any interesting wildlife. They had ""dinosaurs"" around the zoo which made absolutely no sense to me."
3,"Yessir!  Top notch.  So close to 5 stars . . . I'm just a tough grader I suppose.  Great pizza, even the no cheese pizza.  Radish brucetta?  What a nice surprise!  I'm a fan and will be back.  The biggest give-away?  The staff is enthusiastic and proud of the food."
0,Very dirty restaurant.  I should have followed my intuition upon arriving.  Very dirty entry way and interior walls were dirty.  I had the most unimpressive chirashi ever.  Just rice on a plate with the fish on top and a few lettuce pieces.  Nothing else to accentuate it like you'd normally see.  Sub-par.  Avoid.
3,"Stopped by on a monday...pretty dead, which meant excellent service. Our waiter was happy and very helpful. Tried the gingerfruit sangria which tasted like vacation. Had the pretzel bite app which came w/really good mustard mix for dipping. He also recommended the smoked shrimp enchiladas which did not disappoint.

Im not a motorcycle guy, but the decor and museum along w/ all the information tidbits scattered around are pretty cool."
4,Florida Cane Distillery was a fun and informative place to visit!  Everyone was friendly and very knowledgeable....   Brought home a bottle of their vanilla bean... so good
4,perfectly fry and seasoning on tempura super quick and friendly atmosphere I'm craving it all the time now!
4,of course this gets 5 stars. It's a drive- threw daquiri shop! Always come with the 190 or house special.
3,The food at first watch is always great. Our server Connor was awesome with a great smile.
1,"I don't really like this store , every time I come in its not busy but the women working are always following me around the store .. It makes me feel uncomfortable and makes me think they believe I'm a thief or something ... Prices are high , even on clearance .. DSW shoes have better deals and they're a designer shoe wear house"
4,"We have never had a bad meal or experience here. The food is hot and freshly made, the staff is friendly and happy hour specials are a great deal!
One large pizza and a small salad is plenty for four hungry adults! 
They serve appetizers and calzones in additions to their large salad and pizza menu.
You can eat at the bar or enjoy your meal at the many tables and booths. They have a great selection of wines and beer to enjoy."
0,"My wife and I came to this Penn Station on National Lemonade Day.  The employees were not very welcoming.  We ordered our subs along with lemonades.  After we paid we looked at our receipt and noticed that we were charged for our ""free"" lemonade.  We asked about it (even before we got our food) and they told us we had to ask for it when we ordered.  They would do absolutely nothing for us.   I guess $4.50 is not worth keeping customers.  We won't be back to this store."
4,"My husband and I Love this hidden gem! We bring our toddler here and almost take over their patio so he can run around, which they're totally cool with. The food is delicious and completely affordable. Also, the staff is always accommodating."
0,"expected delivery time was 78 min....waited 2 hours for pizza that was cold and my BBQ wings came as cut pieces of boneless that was dry and burnt. When i called, the guy hung up on me when I asked for refund. Called again and he said have a nice night and hung up on me again. it's obvious they don't care about their customers, I wish I saw all the bad reviews before throwing my money away."
0,Convicted felon sex offender is employed there. When you need an employee like him you don't need my business.
4,"I stopped by on a whim and they had the tenderloin on special for $5. It was delicious, you could really taste the pork and had a nice ratio of breading. The bun it was on was really nice too. I also got a side of the bacon mac n cheese and that was good, but nothing special. Amazing deal for the money and it was delicious. Will definitely be back."
4,"Most happening restaurant in Reno!  We visited 3 times during our 3 night stay in Reno and we loved every dish, cocktail and the staff.  Honestly, one of the best restaurants I have ever been to in my life.  Everything is prepared from scratch with a lot of love and attention to detail.  Their mustard is killer and all their meats are from local farms/ranches and prepared in house.   I can't even go into detail about what we ate because we ate quite a bit.  Instead you can see what we ate... posting photos now."
4,"What a great place! Hidden away at the end of the marina parking lot, this place has character, great service and good food. Everyone that was working when we were there were friendly and fun, despite it raining like crazy making it pretty crowded under the covering of the bar. Definitely will be back!"
0,"Not sure what changed, maybe new management, but not the same place it was. I ordered some ribs and they were ice cold. Honestly, nothing we had was good. Seems they have shifted to a party bar instead of a neighborhood grill."
4,"Service was excellent!!! 
They got very busy very fast 
Will not hesitate to return anytime I am in the area..."
4,Everything was absolutely delicious!!! From the moment we walked in to the time we left we received amazing service. Not only from our main waiter Marquis but also from Mya . They made sure me and my mom was okay and happy. I brought by mom here for her 59th birthday and I left feeling like it was my birthday. They were so professional and family like. The chef also came out to introduce himself and was so sweet! Cannot wait to come back.
2,"Mrs and I went there for lunch yesterday.  I had the Torta and she had the Tortilla Soup.  Both dishes were very good.  We also had margaritas (pretty bad, pre-made) and a side of chips and salsa.  The chips and salsa came at the same time as the entrees so I wouldn't recommend.

Very nice patio area but eating out of cardboard boxes with plastic forks is a turn off.  Ordering at the cash register was awkward as well.  It is probably wonderful for dinner."
4,"So happy this place opened on Passyunk Ave . Great selection of flavors including pandan and lavender; I wonder where they source their ingredients from...It would be bonus if they offer vegan options like coconut based milk, best vegan base I think . They are very reasonable with the price and you get unlimited toppings! Choose between a coconut bowl or egg waffle, definitely worth the upgrade!"
4,"I came in just before closing on Sunday 6/12/16 to buy dog food and Super Worms. When I got home, there were literally no live worms in the cup. 
I called and was fortunate enough to get Chuck on the phone, despite being after hours. I explained my circumstance, he went & checked on another cup full, verified they were good, and offered to swap them out. I drive right back, he swapped them out with a smile. This store is always full of friendly and helpful people and I'm happy to give them my business."
2,"Stopped in after the gym.  We were served quickly because no one else was in the restaurant.  I ordered a spicy eggplant stir fry dish.  It was good, flavorful, but super greasy.  It was swimming in a pool of oil."
0,It is clear that Outback is very anti-cop. The fact that they hate cops and promote those who hate cops is disturbing and good enough reason never to come to this place again. The food isn't all great anyway.Kicking a cop out of your restaurant is not cool and still no comment from corporate.
2,"They deserve a bit of an upgrade. They have gotten a lil faster with service. I'm not waiting forever to order and get my food like I was in the past. Breakfast is still the typical breakfast though. I order sausage egg n cheese on a plain bagel. Comes out fresh and hot so no complaints. 

I still haven't gone during lunch yet. Like I said in my previous review, there are tons of options in the city, so most likely its just my breakfast spot when I'm lazy and don't feel like walking out of my building"
4,"This place is a god-send. I am so grateful a friend of mine recommended Ken's Auto-Repair. Ken is kind, funny, honest and does the best job at the best price. I wouldn't go anywhere else."
1,"These guys were great until I had to cancel due to moving out of state. They had some issues canceling and said they'd refund me for overcharging a month. No big deal; everybody makes mistakes. Called every week for a couple months and they said they'd take care of it every time, but they never did. Caused me problems with my old bank, since I had to change banks when I moved."
3,Tried Osaka for the first time. Food was great. We enjoyed a California roll and Mexican roll as well as a bowl of Tom Yum soup. Our entrées were Combination Beef and Red Curry. I asked for my Red Curry spicy and they delivered. Great food. Looking forward to going back.
4,"Best pizza I had in a long time and the service was phenomenal. Jeanne was a great waitress and has fantastic customer service skills. If you're in Exton, Pa check this place out!"
3,"Got right in for lunch, sat at the bar. Had the salmon & goat cheese omelet with a side of cheese grits and a biscuit. Service at the bar was good, despite the bar tenders being busy. I'll go back next time I'm in town."
2,"I had some high expectations for this place - not really sure why but I thought it was going to be amazing.  I got the Caesar salad and the pasta fresca.  The Caesar salad was great, the pasta was just OK. I don't think it was terrible but I just didn't leave the place feeling like I needed to come back for more.

I think if I were to come back that I would try a sandwich or something else different."
4,"My favorite restaurant in Philadelphia.

I just love to eat here. The food is great - love the pork and the lamb, and especially the wasabi mashed potatoes. The drinks are not so great, but I'm really here for the food. 

MUST TRY: the truffled edamame ravioli. This will blow your mind.

I'd also really like to take the giant Buddha home. 

In any case, a little pricey so not your everyday resto, but great for a night out or a date."
4,"We are huge fans of Picasso's on Main Street, so we stopped in at this new location on the second day it was opened. It has the same comfortable ambiance, the same great coffee, and the same personal service. There is a lot of elbow room to socialize or work, and some cozy chairs near a faux fireplace. If it's past coffee time for you, the wine selection is amazing. It's hard to decide now which location is my favorite!"
0,"Drinkers beware!  They will charge you for more drinks then you drank.  Don't put a card down, Pay cash after each drink so you don't get ripped off!"
3,"This may be one of the best burger places I've ever been to. They have a variety of choices, some very inventive and some very traditional, combined with a great ambiance (indoor and shaded outdoor seating), great service, and great drink selection. And one of the keys for me -- they will cook your burger the way YOU want it (medium rare, please), unlike so many places that serve only dry, overcooked burgers."
3,I went here for dinner with my sister and I got the most amazing delicious wrap ever! She got fish & chips and loved it. I've wanted to go back ever since but it's far down on state street and usually if I'm hungry I find somewhere else to eat on the way. I definitely recommend this place for those of you who aren't as lazy as I am.
4,"After a long flight, my wife and I were drained and looking for a nice place to recover.  Spa Aria was the perfect place!  Our little utopia.  My wife had a full body scrub and I enjoyed an hour long massage. We were both relaxed and much happier.  

We wanted to find a spa that was locally owned and operated.  Spa Aria is!  Please support your local businesses.  As a business owner myself, I think this is very important.  

Spa Aria gets five stars from us!"
0,Was highly disappointed. Ordered online. Picked up and it had been sitting outside in the cold (it's 50 out). Tried a bite it was all cold. Crust was floppy and cheese was really greasy.  Ate two slices and threw the rest away.  May come try again but probably not stuff like that just aggravates me.
4,"Went in based on the Yelp reviews and well frankly not many shops take the time to polish the old fashioned way. Best $8 polish I've received on my Allen Edmonds and judging by the number of bags that were stacked of completed jobs~ many people agree. Best part was the guy telling me that ""it's $8 to the man"" so ""pay me whatever you'd like""~ I will be taking my dress shoes there from now on."
3,"Found this restaurant on Yelp. I love the atmosphere, oldie but modern feel. The entire staff was really nice. Informed the bus boy this was our first time and he helped pick out couple things from the menu. We had the spinach dip, strawberry salad which was delicious and the Mac and cheese with pulled pork. I was hoping to try the chicken, that dish was discontinued. Overall I'd come again"
3,"Friendly bartenders! Clean, chilled  glasses and the beer is crisp and cold. Tacos at lunch are decent. Something to munch on while having a beer. A great place to watch football on sundays."
4,"Perenn Bakery has the best pastries! My all-time favorites is the almond croissant, creme brûlée kouign amann, baklava croissant and cardamom twist. Their pastries are the perfect amount of sweetness and are incredible paired with their coffee.

This trip, however, I opted for the avocado toast. Their chili crunch is delicious! Definitely recommend getting something from their breakfast menu in addition to their pastries."
4,Dr Garin is wonderful. I am not a fan of the dentist overall but her staff is friendly and helpful. Dr Garin is amazing friendly and very gentle. I would highly recommend her
0,"Had reservations thru open table, arrived on time waited 7to8 min for the host to check in then we were escorted to the table, 20 minutes past by with no one to even taken our drink order, I think it's very poor management.

(Time of day 2:00pm)"
4,"FABULOUS staff, food and atmosphere!   Truly a place you can take a large family and be enjoyed and appreciated.   Cannelloni, toasted ravioli and tortellini among our FAVORITES!"
2,This is our first time in this restaurant and it is an interesting name for a Chinese restaurant.  I called to check what time they close and the person who answered said that they only take reservation.  The restaurant has excellent COVID-19 health protocols.  We ordered 3 entrees and the portions were huge.  We enjoyed the General Tso chicken.  The chicken chow mein could have more vegetables.  Our food came fast.  We had limited contact with the server and it took a while to get our check.
4,"During our decadent little tripnto New Orleans we ate at many great places...even though it is not technically a restaurant, YoMama's did serve up one of the very best burgers I have ever had and in a fun bar atmosphere.  They even delivered, for free, to our pool at the Omni Royal!
Sometimes in the middle of a trip filled with great food and copious cocktails, all you really want is a great burger...and YoMama's is the place to get it!"
3,I love Godfathers pizza. I like good old cheesy pepperoni pizza and that's exactly what I get when I go there. The staff are all very friendly and warm. I would recommend this place to all my friends
4,"Unparalleled cuisine. Perfectly prepared. Beautifully presented. Extraordinarily tasteful. Delightful atmosphere.  Highly recommend the Plato de Poca Cosa. Perfect every time. Thank you, Suzanne for a wonderful meal and experience every time."
0,"The mold levels are thru the roof! Stay away from this dump!!!!  Nobody at the front desk, open invitation to getting ripped off!!!!"
3,"What a huge difference this visit. The hotel was clean, the staff was friendly. Our room was immaculate and filled with all kinds of new amenities. I was super impressed this time!"
4,"my husband took our dog who was having breathing to webster groves animal hospital. by the time he got there, our sweet boy had passed away. he said they tried to resuscitate him but could not. he said the staff and the vet were exceptionally kind."
4,"I've been loving this place since it opened.  JC the chef has serious skills which are mostly evident at dinner, but brunch is terrific as well. Great vibe, fresh ingredients, a super value. I'm so happy it's in my neighborhood!"
4,Capt'n Chip and the airboat tour was awesome! Fun & adventurous! We saw alligators and even held a baby one! The captain was hilarious & informative.
2,First time we got this to go on Super Bowl it was amazing! So good and perfect. Tonight we ordered to go and the salads didn't come with dressing or the crunchy pieces we added. Pretzel sticks were old and cold. So disappointing. Check your order for accuracy and pass on the cold pretzel.
4,"I've eaten here many times and the food is incredible.  If you are looking for the best Italian restaurant in Philly, go to D'Angelos.  A+++"
4,They use great ingredients for their yogurt and have some rotating selections. Their crepes are also really good. I would choose this place over the chain yogurt places. The location is central to downtown. The owners are really nice and are always working behind the counter.
4,"Very punctual, careful and understanding movers. Thoughtful pre-move and on-move-day communication reassured us that we had booked the right movers, especially since we have had bad moving experiences with other movers.

It was delightful to work with Alex, Steve, and Sam. They wrapped and moved around things very carefully. 

This was our first move experience with Old city movers and we would definitely move with them again when we move next!"
0,Worst pizza and cheesesticks I've ever had.  Ordered for delivery and both were burnt and cold; what a terrible combination.
3,"While the cave is not pristine like Kartchner Caverns, its probably better for younger children.    It also has more local history.  The tour guide was excellent, providing both geological and  historical information.  You get a real cavern experience in a safe environment (I know that sounds contradictory to true spelunkers).  Tall people should watch their heads."
3,"The Blind Goat has local beers on tap, superior chicken wings & excellent flat breads!"
0,It is impossible to get a nail appt here. You have to text them to get an appt. but they don't text back. This is no way to do a business.
2,"This Acme (a larger one) is on my way to work so today I literally ran in and out at 7:20 AM for a quart of milk and box of instant oatmeal packets.

The place was nearly empty at that hour so it was no biggie.
Friendly cashier, too.

No issues and I know I'll be back.
This is the Acme on Rt. 252 near Rt. 30 in Paoli."
4,I've been here a couple times now and have loved it every time!  The mixed drinks here are amazing!  They really know their stuff and they have some very interesting cocktails that you dont see everywhere.  The small plates are also great!  I have had many things here and everything I tried was awesome!  They have these beef sliders that I could eat every day!  If you are looking for a great place to grab a drink after work this is a good option.  The atmosphere is fun and the service is great!  Can't ask for much more!
4,"All you can eat fish on Saturdays is a great deal and the fish is great! Rhonda is always our server and she's excellent! The other staff are good too, but Rhonda is outstanding. Every so often I stop by for a few slices of Sausage pizza to go, and that's good too. The guy who sings on Saturdays usually sings the same songs, I wish he'd change it up a bit. He's very friendly and everyone seems to like him. I go once or twice a month with my parents for the fish. They love it too."
3,"Good food. Probably won't order the half-priced sub again because it seems to be half the meat (definitely less than usual), but it was still good. Overall, good food."
4,Hannah showed amazing customer service when we ordered our pizza and the app wasn't working. She and her coworkers were super polite and helpful. I'll definitely be returning soon! Great tasting pizza too!
3,"This place is no Massage Envy, but was very very relaxing and enjoyful. The staff was very kind and I walked right in and got a full body, 60 minute massage within 10 minutes of my arrival. Overall, I will probably be back again soon! 

Also, their prices are really good!"
4,"I had been sick for almost 3 weeks. Thought it was time to go to Urgent Care. Dr Viglione was the Dr on site today. I was so glad I decided to go, he was wonderful. He not only took his time with me today he also was interested in knowing more about a plant based product I am taking. He was very caring and concerned  about my needs. I will definitely see him again. Thanks to him and the meds he called in for me I'm already feeling better."
4,Out of all of the sushi places I've been in Reno this one is by far my favorite. If your looking for a family environment with amazing sushi and poke bowls. You really need to check out this place update j came at lunch time and even tho they were really busy they handled everyone and made sure everyone was always taken care not to mention they say hello and goodbye when you leave.
3,I have never had a bad experience here. I bring my 2 year old Sheltie here every few months to be groomed and love the job the staff does on him. I've also started bringing my cat ( who is a handful to say the least) here to get her nails cut and the staff has handled her a lot better than other places I've tried. Prices were a lot lower than I expected which was a nice surprise ! I have since moved out of Tarpon Springs to Lutz but am willing to make the drive to come back because of the quality of service that I received.
3,AWESOME FALAFEL. Done right with all of the different salads and sauces. Not just that but the falafel ball itself was really good.
2,"This review is primarily for our service.

After mentioning to out waiter that he removed ti drink menu before I could order an item? It appeared that he completely forgot and never returned to take me order. I received all of my food in a timely manner but after that, the waiter completely disappeared. Would come again but request a different waiter."
0,"Four of us arrived this Sunday morning for breakfast. We noticed that nobody on the staff wore gloves. Both waitresses wore sleeveless tops. Not very appetizing. Service not real good, food was not as we ordered. Maybe it was an off day but we wont be back."
3,"Recently stopped here on a trip down to Maryland.  Great coffee, great atmosphere, friendly baristas, but SLOW service.  Took well over 15 minutes from ordering an Americano to receiving it with only 1 person in front of me.  

Seems like they do a lot of live music and events at night so it's definitely a place to check out if in the area.  

Metered street parking in front."
4,Came for lunch at Brennan's on a Thursday immediately after checking into my hotel. I wanted to go back but figured I should save it for my next trip. The Caribbean milk punch definitely hit the spot and the other brunchy dishes are beautifully done. The soft shell crab was delicious but my friend's Eggs Cardinal was even better. Great service too! Keeping it on my must do list for NOLA visits.
2,Wall comics and history of the restaurant is wonderful. The decor is definitely interesting and you can sense the history.  The food and service is ok. Would recommend for their 20$ lunch menu of 4 courses which is until 2pm.
4,"Great place, great staff. I was welcomed in as soon as I opened the door. Bomb ass tacos and drinks. Will is the man!"
3,"First time here. The restaurant was lively there was a mix of business, family, young and old.  I had the special sandwich if the day which was Jamaican spiced jerk pork. It was on a fresh Italian-style bread topped with pineapple. A side of cole slaw, too. It was very good but a bit too salty for me. The cole slaw was ok with a bit too much dressing."
4,"The employees at this CiCis are stellar!! My roommate and I went in there at 8:40 tonight not realizing they close at 9. Google showed their hours as closing at 10. The manager and his staff were nothing but nice and helpful! They even made the pizza we requested! I do not make it a habit of going in to a restaurant unless I have an hour left before they close, but this staff made both of us feel welcome and not a burden at all!! Not too mention there has never been an instance where we did not enjoy the pizza! Keep up the good work guys!!!"
0,I'm currently in the market for a BMW.  I stopped by  the dealership in Fort Washington to check out their inventory and not a single sales person came out to help me.  Their loss!!!!  I guess I'll be spending my money elsewhere.  I would give them zero stars if possible.
3,"This was my first time visiting Nashville, and we chose this place for brunch...I can honestly say that I will be back the next time I visit Nashville. The service was awesome, the environment was very laid back, and the food was so good. It was so hard to choose from the many options that sounded delicious but I got the Nashville Hot Chicken French Toast"
3,Food was really good but a bit expensive for what I felt the restaurant quality was. I still recommend though.
0,I used to love red lobster but not anymore last night was the last time we will be going I got the crab loves dream king crab was over cooked and tasted awful husband got ultimate feast and his lobster was under cooked and so was his shrimp scampi for 100.00 bill we won't be going to this red lobster they are in need of new management and new cooks.
4,Omg. So goooood. This was the first restaurant I went to as soon as I got to New Orleans and the food was amazing. The crawfish crab cake was delicious and the pasta was so creamy and good.
4,"Really good burgers, fish and chips, shrimp and rice, mac and cheese to die for! Perfect guilty pleasure and great service!"
2,The food is really fabulous and I know they are trying their best with the virus and all ... but more than 25% of the time the order is wrong or there is something missing.  I am forced to open my bag and check before I drive away.
4,"Ann has been doing my gel manicures for 3 years now! I won't go to anyone else as she is a perfectionist!! Always pleased with my nails and if ever I have a problem , which has only happenEd once, she goes above and beyond to correct. Also get my pedicures here and any one of the ladies or gentlemen are great!!"
4,"Love this place. Great selection of wine. Reasonably priced. Fun games to play, good live music and great  staff. Other than an obnoxiously loud group inside, I'll definitely be back."
1,"This place is always overcrowded because the food is always really good for a diner. The problem is the staff. I keep lowering my review every few times I come. You aren't greeted anymore, told how long the wait is, and the wait staff (I swear) seems irritated you showed up. Two stars for the food though."
3,Ordered to go through Uber Eats. Great burger and fries. A little pricey but the to go containers made it worth it. 4 stars only bc it was a little cold by time it got to my house. Will order again soon.
0,There's a fee to use my debit card? Why didn't you just tell me about it so I could've paid with cash?? One star for your poor communication skills.
0,"I can't really give you a review of the food. We went today and waited for 10 minutes without even seeing a server. Several walked past. None spoke to us. It was not busy. No one even offered a water. So we walked out. And as we left, one of the servers told us ""Have a nice day!""
The restaurant also had an odd smell to it. 
We immediately went to a place a little down Gulf Boulevard, and the experience was a 1000 times better."
1,"Not coming back.
Poorly stocked.

Superior customer service I come to expect from Sephora brand is absent.

Not customer focused.

Disappointing.
Ordering online.

For sampling items, Sarasota, Orlando, or International locations are exponentially better."
0,Each time we come here they have the worst service and leave things out of our order. The older white woman who works drive through always has an attitude and the Spanish manager woman is very RUDE. This was on 9/20/2021 12:08pm.
3,Great spot that wasn't too crowded and music was great. Good bartender service and band not to pushy about tips.
1,"This place is a disaster. I've watched it decline since 2016 when I moved into the neighborhood. The staff is hit or miss, some really sweet people and some totally careless. The prices are high, super high, and the fare is decent. The layout is confusing and it seems as though they cannot manage the multifaceted services they're offering (cafe/coffee, restaurant, bar). I'd prefer a spot do one thing really well than three things mediocrely in a frantic manner."
0,"Have not been here for probably 5 years. That may have been around the time it was last cleaned.  It even smells like old, rotten towels. My feet actually stuck to the floor near the ladies room. Our waitress was terrible. One of the other couples at our table cleared most of the dishes. She never took away an empty glass or bottle the entire evening. The food was fine but the chef was not at all engaging. Will never return."
4,The plant based options are wonderful. Try the vegan almond milk shakes. The New Zealand cheddar cheese is so good too. This is New Zealand based Burger Fuel's first and only US location and it's in Indy. It's delicious!
4,"Excellent Service! Delicious Apps. We had the cauliflower, guacamole and peppers apps! Fish tacos were amazing! Just loved the atmosphere and the staff was so friendly and helped us make decisions on what to eat. Jenny, the manager was sweet and accommodating. And Jenna, our server, was very attentive! Can't wait to come back next time we are in Nashville!!!  We even loved the bar tenders who made great suggestions for fun drinks! Yee Haw from a NJ gal!"
4,They added umbrellas so I wanted to update my review accordingly! Looking forward to enjoying more tasty twistee treats here with grandma finally!
2,Amazing view - only place we found to have breakfast on the beach. We loved having our coffee & breakfast with our feet in the sand! Food was good except the biscuits and gravy was cold. Service timing was good but the waitress was very snippy and had a serious attitude.
2,"Meh.   A little too foo foo for me.   Food is ok.  Just a lot of ""fancy dress up"".  

The French press coffee is AMAZING!!!  That I give 5 stars.  

Overall the staff is nice. But I really just like my breakfast simple.   If flare is what you want with crazy pairings. Go for it."
0,"Definitely the nastiest travel plaza I've been to. The women's bathroom was deplorable. Paper towels all over the floor, toilet paper all over the floor, just plain nasty. There weren't any clean paper towels in the bathroom and all the garbages were overflowing. No place to even get a snack at 4:30 AM. This place needs a major renovation."
1,"A quick stop for a test run on salsa, guac and margarita.  Sansa meh..guac fresh, chunky and good, margarita sweet and from a mix..."
3,"I'm pleasantly surprised! My friends and I shared a Hot Fudge Brownie Boat (vanilla ice cream, brownies, hot fudge, topped with cherries). It's exactly the same as the Brownie Waffle Bowl (only available for a limited time), but it's 3 times bigger for the same price as the bowl. More bang for your buck! Recommend."
4,"Great service, good food, and convenient. Always tastes fresh and the portions are pretty generous. Hope Channelside continues to get more cool spots like this.

I wish they had tempura chicken as a protein option though."
4,"No long review from me on this one. This place AWSOME!! It's everything u want from a Mexican joint. The food is fresh and authentic. Prices are low so you can try a lil bit of everything! Don't be shy with the free  margaritas!! Down side is it is very small but cozy. If you get a table ill meet you there on Thursday,"
4,"Food is just like home! The coney dog & Greek salad are made just the way they should be....Perfect! Visited both locations & they're both equally great! They even have Faygo pop & Better Made chips. Look for Alicia, she's the best!"
2,"It was okay. Nothing to rave about. Seemed some of our food was overlooked and some undercooked. I won't go back because for the price, it should have been much tastier and prepared right."
1,"I wanted to really like this LBS, but the owner's attitude is very off-putting.
He seems to not really care much whether you utilize the shop or not. No greeting when you come in, nothing. People that do business like this are not in business long."
1,"I've refrained from writing a review for Jones for the longest time....close to 6 months now. I'm finally caving and acknowledging the fact that it hasn't happened just because this place is Meh. It's not bad...but it's not good.

Most of the time I order Jones on grubhub so I can stuff my face with their thanksgiving dinner like I did recently while in mourning over thanksgiving being over. It is what it is...comfort food. Not a place that I go out of my way to eat at."
3,"At first we were in trouble here, waiting for Amanda, our server, to even bring our drink order and take our food order. Her table next to us wished us better luck than they had getting her to do the job. Then Angie, the duty manager, stepped in and saved the day. Great, hot food and the sodas we wanted came very quickly to the table. It was disconcerting to have folks around us being served their meals even having been seated after us, when our drinks had not even appeared. Thank heavens for Angie!  Amanda can always be retrained."
4,"I really enjoyed my meal here. I came by myself for a little me time. I was treated very well by the staff. 

I got the penne with spicy italian sausage. It was delicious. A had a very nice glass of wine as well. They have an impressive wine list."
4,Absolutely phenomenal!!! Their dipping sauces the appetizer sampler we had were delectable!!! Sushi is fresh and delish. You won't be disappointed with anything here. Staff is extremely friendly and helpful.
4,"I frequent this restaurant on average 3-4 times a week.

The service is always superb. The happy hour crowd is always professional and the drink prices during happy hour are the best in the city!

With that said, Ste Marie keeps the menu and drinks fun especially for 30 something's.

My new favorite meal is the steak Cobb salad!"
3,We came here on a Monday night for their happy hour. We ordered the fennel sausage pizza and the burrata. Both were tasty! They serve fried chickpeas when you order drinks and they were also very good. Wish I could be more helpful with this review... they have a cool signboard inside? Worth a pic for IG.
0,"Less than mediocre. They routinely get something wrong with my order, serve below quality food, and take too long to do anything. Everyone who works there seems completely disinterested. I'm not looking for perfection, but had to stop going there because standards dropped wayyyyy down"
4,"I eat here weekly. For chicken options, always go with tinga, its well marinated. and the tomatillo sauce is awesome."
4,"I had 5 bedrooms painted and all my baseboards caulk 3500 sqf home on 10/11/21.  Tino and his crew did a fantastic job.  They were on time, very professional.  They protected all my carpets and floors.  When they where done, they clean up everything, like they were never there.  Very happy with the work and I would definitely recommend them.  I know they are quite busy so if you are unable to reach them.  Try texting them at the number provided on their website."
3,My boyfriend brought some back to Houston...they were still good the next day. YUMMMMZZZ. We'll be going back mid-late November and I'm so excited to try a freshly fried batch!
3,"Nice place for sale stuff. But they don't come down enough on the shoes when they send them out there. It's the same as the sale in the regular store.
Great place to find handbags......"
4,Best barber shop in town. I love the interior design. They also carry a nice line of men's clothing.
1,I gave it a 2 because of the waitress. She was very nice and very attentive. But are you kidding me? The food was below average and not what it was advertised as! White fish for the fish and chips? They couldn't identify the white fish.
4,Highly recommend the grouper sandwich. I would have shared a picture but I ate it all. So good.
4,Great place for happy hour and cool ambiance. We come here for the wings...nuff said.
2,5 stars for staff and decore. Tvs and couches on the balcony was a great way to watch a sporting event.  Unfortunately the nachos were the worst I ever had. The pulled pork was cold and gray and tasted like it was sitting in the fridge for days. I was hungry for more food but after the nachos I didn't trust the food so I can't comment on the rest. I recommend eating somewhere else first but definitely come here to drink and watch the game.
0,This place is a total ripoff! The burgers are tiny & bland. For $13 I expected an amazing burger. I ordered the Ramsey burger bc I love pimento cheese. I literally got a tiny well done patty with the tiniest dollop of pimento cheese. Seriously! For 2 people we spent $50 for 2 burgers & 2 drinks.  I will not be back. If you want a good burger try sportsmans grill.
4,"Hands down one of the best Sushi places in the area.  I've been there several times over the past couple of years and the food quality is very good, and maybe more importantly, consistent."
4,"Lindsey is the best! Her deep tissue is perfect, and she is always able to relieve the stress knots that she finds! She has different aromatherapy options, and keeps you relaxed during the whole session. I wouldn't go anywhere else for my massages!"
3,"I love that with each purchase of queso you get one free refill! I ordered three tacos: steak, shrimp and redfish...all great!!!"
3,"Very nice ambiance and delicious Jambalaya. My husband had the creole pasta which was tasty but not as good as my dish. Nice drink selection, live music, a great spot overall."
0,"Been to Lowry dental about 5 times as my parents chose them as my primary dentist but I always cancel because I never liked the place too much. I mostly went when I was younger. I just remember one time when I was about 8, I was in a back room and once the hygienist finished with me he said he had to run and go get Dr. Lowry. I was literally sitting in the backroom scared and alone for at least an hour waiting for the doctor. Super young and super confused. Also the doctors breath usually smells really bad."
4,"I needed a shed to store my car in for a month. Doug made the whole process easy, the shed was clean and I appreciated the security measures to keep the property safe. I would definitely use them again the next time I needed storage."
4,"I absolutely love this place.  I have been there for lunch and dinner many times.  Lunch is always quick.  Dinner is BYOB.  I highly recommend the Evil Jungle Princess.  Everyone I have recommended it to has become addicted! Eat in as oppose to take out for lunch.  One, you can get the soup, appetizer and entre for a cheap price.  Two, the plastic container they package the lemongrass soup in always pops open and spills ! What a mess and a shame to waste such delicious soup!  This is a wonder place with great service."
4,"Great vegan and gluten free options.
Has wonderful service and wonderful options of dessert for people with food allergies. 
Reasonably priced. 
Highly recommended."
4,"I absolutely love this place!! The service is incredible, and so is the ever changing Malbec selection. You can eat paleo here too!"
4,I went today with my three-year-old. The two ladies Dawn and Brea could not have been nicer and more helpful. They were quick efficient and very patient with him.
3,I eat here all of the time and never have any regrets.  The staff is cordial and the owner is incredibly kind and helpful. I usually get pho or the egg banh mi and a couple egg rolls. Honestly just writing about it I want to go get a bowl of pho to get my sniffles expelled. Highly recommend and I will continue to eat here.
3,Ordered pizza for pickup. 4 topping large pizza for $25.  little pricey for my liking. Pizza was pretty good. not too greasy. Generous toppings. Would order again.
3,"Great place to grab a beer and some crawfish!

I love crawfish and only try to come down when it's season. This place had some REALLY good crawfish. You can always tell by the potato if the seasoning is just right. 

This place had so many field games to play and so much outdoor seating. 

The bathrooms were extremely clean as well!!"
0,"Easily the worst staff in town, 5he lady at desk was more interested in messaging on her phone than working with us, did not offer a tour saying that no one is in the office, this after my wife tried at least 4 times before tried to get a swim class booked. When asked why is your gym better, the answer was ""we are cheap "" as if to say that we dont care for you bvis we are cheap and so are you. My suggestion to all AVOID this place , they treat you like piece of shit."
0,"My UPS driver retired and the person who took his place will not deliver to my house.  She doesnt feel safe driving up here.   She has been throwing my packages on the side of the road next to ghe mailbox.    Ive lived here 10 years with no problems.   No problem with postoffice or fed ex either.   I talked to them and they said they cant ask their drivers to do something where they dont feel safe.   Its a rural area for goodness sake.   

They should do what they get paid for.   

If they cant drive their route, they dont need the job."
3,"This is an oasis in a bed of chaos. Todd at the front desk suggested we go to the river area and we had a blast. And Caleb!  He is wonderful and oh so friendly. The rooms were nice, clean and air conditioned. It was a great location, close to everything."
1,"Good beer selection...  Not a fun place to hang out...  Like the other location, good beer doesn't make up for bad service, sub par food, and a horrible bar set up...   I would almost call this place a dive bar..."
2,"HAVE AGAIN: I'd go again, but not wait in a long line. Next time, perhaps there would be flavors of interest.
NOT HAVE AGAIN: The peach cobbler was OK, but just not very peachy. They were out of several flavors, leaving about 3 of the remaining 10 flavors made with lavender, a flavor I am not at all fond of."
4,"You have a great store and great products. Feel free to draw lines on the ground at checkout. Although my fellow patrons act like they care, act like they're better, they don't hesitate to jump in front of someone else patronizing your establishment (even when you have 3 items in a hand basket) when a cashier says next to get their full cart out quickly. Maybe this is just my experience several times ‍"
3,Great decor and service. The food was amazing! We got the vegetable samosas and my meal was the Baingon Bharta..delicious! I'll definitely be going back. Plus there was live music when we went Tuesday night. Cool place and pretty affordable dishes.
4,I'm only rating my man Jay....the bartender. By far the best and most knowledgable barman around. Jay is all that a bartender should be. Not fake and trendy....just loves his craft and even knows the history of every drink he pours. All in our group were raving about him. Can't wait til I'm back at the Conrad Hotel to stop by for a cocktail and a history lesson from Jay.
3,"Beautiful hotel with new facilities! The room was sparkling and the pool is heated. There is music and a bar by the pool which makes for a nice relaxing atmosphere. I would give it 5 stars, but it's horrifying how inefficient valet parking is run here. If you need to retrieve your car give the staff at least 45 minutes. Also, if you use the texting option it's a little faster than waiting in line. Kind of crazy given how pricey it is to park here. Be prepared for $25/daily resort fees as well."
0,"I use to work there, and it was ok. Kinda cool. But they changed their name to ""The Fillmore""  Paaaallllease. That place is no where near the real Fillmore.  Would never be as great either.  

 Lost all respect. Lame."
3,My husband really enjoyed the ribs.  They were well prepared and he liked all sauces available especially the hot ones. I had the brisket which was fine but I was not a fan of the sauces.  I prefer a sweeter sauce. Their sweet sauce wasnt very sweet. I guess I just like my Chicago BBQ.  Staff was very friendly.
3,"What a great place! Friendly bartender. Laid back, fun atmosphere. Giant connect four! Their beers are yummy!"
0,"Hasn't been updated or renovated to compete with UA theaters in the area. Seats were hard, non-reclining, and our theater did not have stadium-style seating."
4,Hands down my favorite gelato ever. Try the strawberry chocolate gelato. You won't be disappointed. Beyond amazing.
4,"Found this place on yelp when looking for somewhere to eat before flying out of the airport. (Only a 10 minute drive!) It was wonderful!!! I had read their story online and as someone who has an food/health issues I really appreciated their heart! It is a great atmosphere, friendly staff, and delicious food!! I had the bently burger with a lettuce wrap and an Affogato. The area it is located in is also a lovely place to have a little stroll."
3,"One of the the nicest coffee shop spaces I've been in. Fairly large, nicely appointed, with plenty of comfortable seating. I found it a great place to get work done for a couple of hours. That said, I didn't love my americano. They seem to take pride in their roast here, so either it was just an off day, or their product doesn't suit my palate with it's bitter finish."
3,"I knew I wanted a bagel this morning so what place better to go than a bagel shop in the center of philly. Being mindful, I came here with very high expectations. I ordered the veggie Sammy. It was good and tasty but I felt like something was lacking. Overall I'm going to come back and see if I can find something that'll suit my tastes alittle more!"
1,Went last night and the air conditioner has been out for 3 days. Nobody bothered to tell the guest and it was a miserable experience. Really disappointed cause i liked this place! I know things happen but in 90 degree weather during the summer I'm less empathetic because bowling and drinking with no air doesn't equate to a good time.
3,"Really awesome food and menu. Good vibe and cool decor. I live in the neighborhood and I love all of the bars/restaurants we have to choose from, however when a restaurant reserves all the tables for reservations it really cuts the casual diner out of the picture. I would encourage this place to leave space open for walk ins as well."
4,Great practice with a great staff!always eager to please and very helpful...I would recommend this being your primary doctor to anyone
4,"What a great experience today!!! Lyndel was our waitress & she was fun, personality plus!! The food was served hot & even the burger that my friends split came already cut on separate plates! Definitely will come again when at GSR!!!"
4,This place serves good fast Thai food. What more do you want it's great. And the people are very nice
0,"This store has minimal selection,  a bad smell, and never has enough registers open. There is always a long line."
3,"One of the bands that I follow played here on April 16th on the outdoor stage. Sound was mixed well, stage area was elevated and OnesAll was outstanding as usual. Ordered a couple of authentic Chicago dogs w/fries and coleslaw. I think they used a vienna beef hot dog as the flavor of the Chicago dog was outstanding. Not bad for $6.50.  They also have a pretty wide selection of beer and other drinks available. We'll likely return when another band that we follow returns to the outside stage."
4,This place was amazing! We showed up at 7am right when they opened and they were so nice and welcoming. Sarah was super attentive and had great recommendations! Definitely try the pecan French toast.
4,Best Cesar Salad ever!  Absolutely loved the goat cheese crusted chicken special with cherry sauce and fresh fingerling potatoes and vegetables done to perfection. Simply - the food is fabulous! Service was fantastic!   We will definitely be back.
4,Great food! Great service! Speedy delivery! The pizza is delicious! Lazos is my favorite delivery restaurant!
4,A must. My wife and I where in aw for three days. Wow is all we can say. We are back again next year. Love the NOLA residents. You are the best.
0,They need to fire the pharmacy manager or or they need to get someone in who will fill what a Doctor proscribed. I am certain that all the years of medical school count for more then you pharmacy tec school. Don't ever come here. This place needs to be shut down.
4,"Very friendly and helpful! Great small business to support! From the start, Tamara helped me to get the best deal for the best price. I got my windshield replaced and my windows tinted. I came back later because my window wasn't rolling up all the way. I was a bit hesitant to call because I had procrastinated in letting them know about it. They said no problem, they were under warranty, scheduled me in 2 days, & I was out of there in 30 mins. Very friendly and take good care of you. I have no reason to take my business anywhere else!"
4,I first off want to say I've been to almost every steakhouse in Nashville and I will say this is one to stop at and enjoy their porterhouse steak. Perfectly prepared and the sides are very tasty. I have to give it to Ben for a great experience. The staff was great and helpful. The sweet potato pie was so so good. This restaurant is in my top 3 in Nashville. Stop in and give them a try. You won't be disappointed.
0,"My ""blackened redfish with seasonal veggies"" came out as a piece of fish on a salad. I don't mind a salad, so no big deal. The fish was an overcooked piece of salmon (redfish doesn't have pink flesh) and the ""salad dressing"" was a fiery hot sweet chili sauce??? Nothing about this made sense and was too hot to be edible. The beer was cold...that was why it earned 1 star."
2,The meat was good but the sides were not that great.  I like the atmosphere but the food was just above par.
4,"This place is a mandatory stop every time we go to the border : )
We stopped here in January and our server Amanda was great.

Their menudo and caldo de res are good, we also like the chips and salsa.

If you save your receipt (which I have been forgetting to do) you get a 10% discount on your next visit."
3,I only went there for a lunch. Because dinner price is too high. The price of lunch is more reasonable. They have various choices. The serves is good. I will be back for lunch for sure.
4,"Cute, family friendly ice cream shop! 
Each time we pass through the area we always stop for ice cream here because they make all their ice cream in house. The strawberry jalapeño ice cream is fantastic! Highly recommend!"
3,"Fried chicken is clearly the star here.  As for the sides, go with butter beans or the red beans and rice.  All other sides were extremely average which was a disappointment.  The cornbread was OK as well.  Would I go back? Definitely, but I would set my expectations of anything but the chicken accordingly."
4,Excellent Filet Migon.  Cooked perfectly and great sear.  Would recommend highly for casual dinner out or special occasion.
1,"No manatees to be seen! Seems to be a seasonal thing-- wish that was advertised more up front. The exhibits in the building are nice, but don't really redeem the place when the main attraction ins missing."
4,"Natasha is an expert at working with curly hair, which is really hard to find! I've been seeing her for a couple years now as my hair has been growing out post-cancer treatment. As I transition through different lengths, she knows exactly what to do. She also styled my Mom's hair for my wedding day last year and she was amazing not only with my Mom's super straight hair (complete opposite from mine), but also handled my Mom's difficult  stressed-out mood with grace. She's a real pro!"
4,Hidden gem in Downtown Indianapolis! The food is absolutely amazing. We get takeout from here almost every week and are always impressed. Staff is lovely and the prices are great!
3,Have to downgrade rating to four stars due to SLOW! service on both recent visits. Sit down and order a drink on a busy night and expect to wait up to 20 minutes for it to arrive. Also expect to see your server not as often as you like. Disappointing as they certainly are busy enough to hire more servers.
4,"What a beautiful sight to wake up to every Day... Saguaro National Park; Vail, AZ. #Tucson"
4,"I love going here and am willing to drive out of my way for the experience and comfort. Very professional, clean and beautiful atmosphere. Every mail technician I've had has done a really great job. This is my nail spot and I don't plan going anywhere else. I get a gel manicure and pedicure and my eyebrows waxed here."
3,"Stopped at the Gazebo for lunch. We have ate here before so knew what to expect. My wife and I split a whole Muffaletta. Tasty as always. Although this time it seemed to have an excess of cheese, but all around just tasty. 

I also had the Jambalaya. Perfect. Plenty of meat in each bite, just a bit of heat to it. Perfect amount of spice.

My daughter had a fried chicken poboy with fries. Tasty, tasty, tasty."
4,Extremely helpful and pleasant!  Have a great selection of flowers at an easy to get to location. They've made a life long customer!
1,"We ordered a ""Fun-Fête"" cake, but even a delicious $50 cake with a border of brightly colored sprinkles, can't redeem itself when it has ""Happy Birthday Lauren!"" written in BROWN."
4,Been with Suncoast pest control for many years and love this team! Loretta in the office rocks! She always works hard to fit an appointment into my busy schedule. David also is such an awesome technician
0,"There is always something going wrong with this store and they close randomly for ""machine malfunctions"". This is such a disservice and then they wonder why they lose business to Starbucks."
0,"Ordered a spicy tuna roll and shrimp
Tempura roll both with brown rice (which I paid extra for) Waited an hour and half. Did not receive brown rice. Shrimp tempura had maybe one shrimp.. Half of the pieces did not have any shrimp. Spicy tuna roll was half crunch (which I didn't ask for) and half old ""tuna"" which was basically a fish flavored paste. I ended up throwing both away after eating one piece each. Waste of time and money. Will never order from Dream House again."
3,Day or night or even the afternoon you can always find good entertainment hold beer and some nice grub. Gina the bartender is super friendly on the first floor. Not much different than many of the Broadway places but this place is also a lot of fun.
4,Excellent seamstress for wedding alterations. Courtney is very personable and crazy talented. I had a simple dress with a long train and she constructed a beautiful hybrid French/American bustle for me. She works quickly and can give you a sense of several options to consider. I felt confident that my dress was in good hands.
3,"Nice low key location in a cool neighborhood, friendly staff, and quick service- can't compain! Oh yah, the food!  SO good!  Toasted buns, smoky meat, and all the BBQ sauce you can squeeze on to EVERY SINGLE BITE.  My husband raved about their potato salad (which was good, but tasted like egg salad, lol).  The mac and cheese was tasty, and overall, I loved it.  Cute hole in the wall that delivers."
4,Cute little hangout and the burgers were great! We would stop here again while in Nashville. Casual joint that made it easy to drop in after a day of traveling.
1,"I am kind of bummed out.  This is my favorite cheesesteak place in the city IMHO BUT, they stopped carrying Coke products...now it's all Pepsi stuff....why not both?  Not much of a margin on the Coke?!  Disappointed."
3,"Drag queens ruling the floor and busting out the moves - why the hate? lol

Also, $3/beer vs. My $5 Yuengling from Double Decker so I'm not upset and my coworkers and I were able to hit up the VIP area since our friend brought us to the area. The bartender in the back was quit slow and not able to make lemon drop shots so definitely had to drop a star. Other than that, my coworkers and I dropped it like it was hot on the spacious dance floor in the back area with a DJ pushing out good songs!"
4,The torsion spring on my garage broke a couple of weeks ago and Garage works was able to come and fix it within a few days.  They responded within minutes to my request on Yelp and saved me a lot of effort trying to figure out who could help fix the spring.  I definitely recommend them if you need any sort of garage work done!
4,"I have been insured with Glenn Eckert's office for over 10 years and have been very happy with the service I have received from Glenn, Kim and Sherry.  I know they are always looking out for my best interest and they will go above and beyond to make sure I am taken care of.  
  Shelly V."
4,"Oh my!  This needs to be included in your plans when you come to New Orleans!  And make sure you buy the movie--an innovative retrospective. Walk down Magazine Street .7 miles from Canal. The Pacific and European experience is so well done. Both have a walk from despair to victory.  
Plus, if a World War II veteran is on hand as a volunteer, make sure you sit down and quiz him/her about their involvement. We visited a 98 year old who survived the Battle of the Bulge in Europe."
4,Easily the best pizza I've had since I visited New York earlier this year. Cannot praise the owner and the staff enough. Will be back again and again.
3,Great service.  Attentive not annoying.  Delectable cuisine.  Ample parking.  Sizable portions. I left an item in the restaurant and they tracked me down to get it returned.
3,"Good service and atmosphere. I went with a larger group - 8 people - and the staff was attentive with the food arriving without a significant wait.  The meatballs in polenta as an appetizer was excellent.  I ordered a chopped salad which was very nice, not the run-of-the-mill chopped...and the fettuccine alfredo. With the exception of the garlic chips on top being a bit much for me, I found the dish to be delicious with a mix of interesting flavors and textures."
0,It seems they close whenever they feel like it.  Twice in the last month I stoped and they were closed at 11:30. Hours list 1am.
4,"I had Steve and his sons come out and install our awning. I've never met a more nicer, respectful, clean group of group of workers. To top it off. They did an amazing job. I would absolutely recommend this company to anyone."
4,"First time in the Gulch and could not have picked a better place for date night. Complimentary valet parking to start plus the hostess group was very nice. The ambiance of the restaurant is stylish and relaxing. I felt as comfortable in my dress as I would have been in a pair of jeans. Our Waiter (Richie) was very friendly and quite knowledgeable of the menu, taking us through his personal favorites which were all spot on. Food was amazing and worth the price. Overall we loved our time here and will definitely be back."
4,Ate here for an early lunch after walking around STL. I HIGHLY recommend the spinach artichoke dip and the pretzels. Delicious!!
2,"We love the food here, but they've recently changed how they provide service. We ordered takeout, just three tacos and some queso; it took us 35 minutes to receive our food.  This is unacceptable and disappointing.  We will give them a few more chances, but if this continues we will find our Taco fix elsewhere."
4,"Wonderful relaxing dinner in a nice, but not elegant, atmosphere. Good service and nice decor. The garlic bread is to die for, and the calamari was the best I've had, very tender and flavorful. Hunt down this place next to the movies theaters, don't be deterred by the dark facade."
3,"River House is an excellent new community with friendly and helpful staff as well as nice and extensive amenities, which include a dog wash station, pool, game room, work out room, grill area and courtyard. It is within walking distance to downtown, but the area is quiet and I do not feel like I am in the hustle and bustle of the city. The only negative I have experienced is the lack of parking for guests."
4,"Service=very solid seated quickly greeted wit fried noodles which was solid half price sushi always good if you don't like sushi they have Chinese food very solid 

Good sushi and at half price can't beat it 

Gave us some wet naps and oranges at the end very solid 

Overall very solid experience solid food solid service"
4,"We came here for the vegan cheesesteak, but the perfect fries and hot Nashville fried seitan sandwich won our hearts. The cheesesteak was good, but the roll was slightly on the chewy side. Love the relaxed atmosphere but I could see issues with seating during busy hours."
4,Great as usual. The service is always great and the food is always exceptional!! Can't wait to get back here for lunch one day.
3,Some really great Thai food - wouldn't really expect it when walking in. The curry here was amazing. Pleasantly surprised by the serving size as well. Would recommend it for lunch or carry out. Hungry for Thai just thinking about it.
1,I try to avoid this place when necessary but sometimes I have to stop in there. The lines are always WAY too long! The customers are very rude. They don't have much stuff at this location.
3,"I was there in mid July 2018. We got there real late, so there were no sides other than fries available. The staff was friendly & hilarious! A bit urban, but in a good way. The chicken was good! But I personally didn't see any taste difference, than what I've normally had. The place was a bit of a mess, but there was only person who seemed to be cleaning up."
2,"Food is pretty good, just make sure you order ya second order of fries as soon as you get ya first or you've finished the first batch of 5 fries they give you and be waiting forever with a burger that gotten cold to order the second"
0,"Casino In General.... Meh! 
lobster Buffet (not just lobster): Lobsters have no claws, meat is rubbery... It was overall the most awful food experience we ever had for $30/pp. Never again. Save your money.

***PS - the bathrooms (men & women) were disgusting near the gift shop. There was a mess in each toilet and on the toilet and on the floor. There were no toilet seat covers in the women's room.  GROSS!!! They need to be attended 24/7 as most casinos do!"
2,Kombucha was awesome! The burger was okay. All the sauces seemed to miss the note. I was hoping for crispy fries and they were on the soft side.
1,"They used to be good, but after the change in ownership/management it went downhill fast.
The buffet frequently was left to sit unattended, and even getting a seat is not as easy.

I tried it several times after the new owners took over but will probably go elsewhere, now."
4,"Better than your typical bar food. Outstanding live music on thursdays, singer plays all types and styles of music and asks for requests."
3,Average price for average food. I have always gotten good customer service that's why I keep coming back :)
0,"Rescheduled THREE TIMES! Never apologized for not delivering. It would take them a week to get back to me each time. When I asked for immediate resolution, they finally got back to me and said they had refunded me. I can not believe that they did not say sorry for the inconvenience ONCE! I do not see this business lasting long by the way they treat their customers, and I can also see by all of the reviews that my experience is not an isolated one. Very disapointed"
4,"David was an amazing tour guide for our sinister criminal intentions tour. We have participated in other tours and what sets this one apart is the small group atmosphere so you can really hear the stories as well as not feeling like a constant sales pitch. David was very knowledgeable about the subject matter and even gave more resources and things to look up, so it was a very interesting and informative tour! It is focused on the details of around 5 New Orleans murders so not for the faint of heart but definitely what we were looking for."
4,The slice of the hill food truck was at Spanish Lake park today for feast in the park.  I came to due to there being a wide selection of trucks there but after talking with the staff I decided to spend my hard earned money on them and I am glad I did.  This was one of the best pizza's I've had in a while.
4,Great.   We had breakfast and everyone loved the lamb and egg sandwich.   It was a cut above anything else in the area.
4,"Loved the quick service and the incredible matcha latte! They made our coffee within 10 minutes of closing, which not everyone will do!"
4,"Great tacos! Chips salsa, amazingly simple! Service great! Ambience fun, and competent! Food was simple, flavorful, not complicated! Enough said. Come here if you craving authentic Mexican food, they prove that amazing Mexican food does not need all the gimmicks."
3,"We took my Mom there for a quick and easy bite to eat while shopping at Peddler's Village. Have to say (and we're a pretty picky family) that the food was very good. We had the grilled cheese/tomato on spinach bread, burger, fries, tuna, fresh iced tea. All really tasty and fresh. The space is quaint and smallish, service was very nice. Definitely recommend this place!"
0,"Great movie shop with great prices. The unfortunate part of this place is the staff, one in particular a heavy-set man who was very rude. I went in earlier today and he was so rude to my son when he asked him a question. He was not helpful in anyway and almost seemed bother when we asked him questions about the rentals. Very unfortunate. I will definitely not be going there anymore, won't waste my time and money where service doesn't seem to be needed or appreciated."
4,As always the service was excellent and the food was delicious and super fresh. The best part by far was the bartender. She visited with me and was able to tell when I was game to talk. Great experience.
4,"Now, this wasn't our first trip to NOLA, so we knew we didn't want some tourist spot! We know good pizza and no matter how late it was, we were not willing to pass up on taste! 
We ordered a double cheese pizza with light sauce.
Regular cut the first night, and square cut the second night. The pizzas are as customizable as you can imagine and the service is face. They delivered right to our hotel lobby and didn't keep us waiting a second. The pizza was hot, the ingredients were fresh, and everyone savored each bite."
2,"I think the mini golf needs to be updated. 
It's looking shabby. Great please to mini golf. Just needs a little ""facelift"". 
It's very crowded so expect that and expect to be rushed thru the game."
1,"Ok. Restarant is run down. Food was ok, with big portions. Bar is really nice. Beer was ice ice cold."
4,The menu varies from philly cheesesteak sub to sushi to cheese platter! Service is normally slow but worth it. Great pre game spot on weekends around 9pm.
0,They put spicy brown mustard in my pepper jack turkey instead of honey mustard. Employees were sitting in dining room eating food while there were plenty of plates and tables to be cleaned. Bad vibes. Will not return ever again
4,"The wonderfully friendly hostess was able to get us in from the wait list when another party canceled, and I'm so glad she did. The tapas style menu has several good sounding dishes; we ordered the stuffed dates, tempura shrimp, and lamb sliders, and all three were hits. The live band was cool too- they played an eclectic array of music from Texas swing to electronica, all well."
4,"We strolled over to get a sushi lunch after a delightful morning at the Franklin Institute. I'm easily impressed by sushi that's fresh - you don't have to do anything else fancy to it to make me happy, and this place hit the mark. We actually saw fresh fish being delivered while we were dining. Cute little ambiance, though not exactly the ideal aesthetic for a dining with a five year old. I can say no one freaked out when she spilled her soda."
0,Slow. Poor service.  The staff were all standing around laughing when there was a huge line wrapped around the building.
2,"We were sat and waited a while for a waitress to even get our drink order. The drinks were tasty. I had a punch punch and the husband had a red stripe. We ordered appetizers which were a beer and pear salad and a prosciutto, caramelized onion and goat cheese flat bread. The flat bread tasted ok but wasn't warm- it was room temp. The salad was overly dressed and bland. We also waited a while for our check. Nice scenery but the rest of the experience was blah."
4,Great place for build your own pizza that is fast fired in two minutes at 800 degrees. Kids can put what they want on it. Reasonably priced. Friendly service.
2,I love a good cupcake.  I love to shop local.  I have stopped by here on a few occasions to surprise my daughter with red velvet cupcakes.  The cupcakes aren't bad.  Ive had better cupcakes.  She loves them.  There selection changes daily and some of the cupcakes give a percentage of the cost to charitable causes which I love. Will I be back.  Most definitely.  As I said my daughter loves this place.
3,"Really good food and unique atmosphere.  Everything is white (very 2001: A Space Odyssey) They have a conveyor belt serving food at the bar and chair in that lounge that light up when you sit on them.  The ""pods"" have buttons on the wall that will change the color of the lights."
4,"Absolutely in love with the vegetarian options. I've only tried the burger and cheesesteak but they are all I want to eat. Can't wait to try the other options. I love going in, it's such a nice and clean deli. The one up on 2nd and Fairmount is great too."
2,"We took the Ghost Tour with Bill on a Sunday night. The stops and the information were interesting and it was nice to see some different places that we hadn't yet seen on our trip. But our tour guide was not good. His passion for his job was evident, but his delivery was in need of help. Overall, wish we had spent our money on a different ghost tour."
3,"From Marltin to Voorhees. I had to embark on my first trip tobthis Aldis on thr white horse pike. I just moved from Marlton to Voorhees in South Jersey. When I dont have alot or dont want to spend alot, I do not pass go to Aldi. Evem though I am by a major grocery chain within five minutes of my house, I still found myself coming to Aldi for a few items. I was happy in the long run with my decision."
3,Moe Joe's serves a generous breakfast. Good coffee. The patio seating is a definite plus.
4,"I really like this box. It's professional, more clean than the rest and they know how to get down. Good, functional WOD and our class trainer David was very helpful in explaining the workout and pushing us to our potential when we needed it most. I recommend this gym and me and my sister Jessica will be back!"
4,The staff are super friendly and I'm always a sucker for pancakes. I look forward to coming back after I work off the giant stack I consumed tonight.
3,"The crepes were much much better than I had anticipated.  I had the spinach and goat cheese crepe and my wife had the smoked chicken crepe with apples and walnuts.  The ladies working the truck were friendly and efficient.  I wish I knew where they are all the time, but I don't do twitter..."
0,Wish could do 0 stars. The bartender Barbara used cc info to shop online. Next time she was a server  so obviously this establishment knows about her tactics of being a thief. Will be filing a report
4,"The food is delicious, best pressed Cuban sandwich in Tampa,  their Spanish pork and plantas are out of this world.  They close at 3, only open on weekdays."
2,"Drinks were absolutely amazing! Highly recommend their bloody marry. Service took forever and that's the reason for the three stars. Food was decent. I had the spicy chicken taco and they were really good but my boyfriends avocado burger was subpar with what tasted like fake avocados on it. However, I would go back bc the view and atmosphere is incredible!"
4,"FIVE STARS

The staff was amazing, accommodating, and very friendly. The food was excellent, and the portions where huge. The mixed fajitas for one was enough to feed two people twice. In an area like Nashville where Mexican restaurants are a dime a dozen these guys are definitely a diamond. Totally worth the drive for the experience. 

On a side note...this is the first time I have rated a restaurant online"
3,"I've been to Sushi Brothers several times for lunch to meet a friend. It's not very crowded during the day, so easy to get a table. They have their own parking lot across the street which is nice because street parking around that area can be hard to find. Today I had the seaweed salad and the Sushi Brothers special roll. The roll has salmon and avocado on top and tempura salmon and cream cheese inside. My friend had a house salad with extra ginger dressing, miso soup and tempura shrimp. All were good and fresh."
3,Food and service are excellent and consistent. Been eating here weekly for years. Drinks are tasty as well.
4,Cali is so delicious! Love their fresh ingredients and delicious food. All the bowls are delicious but I love the spicy Brazilian- the sauce that comes with it is amazing!
3,I walked in early and they were open at 9 when my usual place doesn't open till 10.   This is my first time here.   Clean and lots of service stations.   I had Ngan or Nancy work on me and she was great.   Friendly and good at what she does.   The music is pleasant so spending time here was relaxing.   Will be back.
4,Drag brunch- so yummy! And so fun! The power went out while we were there but the queen kept the show going. Bow down to her! Such an amazing experience.
3,"Wanted sushi but was too lazy on a Saturday night to go out and pick it up, a friend of mine referred me to CJ Wok. Pleasantly surprised at the quality of the sushi, coming from a Chinese restaurant, would recommend to anyone looking for their sushi to be delivered"
0,"Worst dangerous parking lot ever. Exit has huge pot hole. The parking lot is jammed. Too small. Too tight to turn.  Amazing gentleman in the parking lot trying to help the traffic. I have never encountered such a concentration of entitled, rude drivers. Driver's cutting people off, cutting line, backing up and driving waaay too fast. One accident and two almost accidents observed just while in drive through. I will never ever ever go to that chick Fila again and I love Chick fila but that location is a mess    Food was fine"
3,"Truly a hidden gem. Would never have known this was here if it weren't for yelp.
We shared the truffled mac and cheese for an appetizer...WOW. Great flavor. 
I had the Cuban sandwich as an entree with a side of brussel sprouts..both of which were divine.
Service was also great. Helpful waitstaff. Even when it started to get busy.
Don't miss out on this place"
3,The food was excellent and the atmosphere is wonderful. The intimate seating arrangements are ideal for talking. My girlfriend and I had an awesome time.
4,We had a great experience with Comeaux Furniture and Appliance!  Great inside sales service and excellent delivery!  Thanks to Willie and Mario for a courteous and professional delivery experience and Thanks also to Dante and Kevin in sales!
0,"This place blows!   Does not even come close to Golf Super Store in big cities.  This place is nothing more than an expanded Dick's golf section and in this town that means next to nothing.  I wonder how long it will take until this place joins the  ""Now Closed"" section of this defunct Center.  Small selection of anything including golf attire.  Along with the cracky, old salesman that seem very tried and bored.  Very sad!"
4,I love this place !! Simple as that !!
4,"The Vine baked the MOST perfect two-tiered pumpkin/chocolate cake for my cousin's graduation party. After we devoured that, we finished off two dozen of their chocolate chip cookies that literally melt in your mouth. If dessert isn't a selling point for you, their Nutella croissants are to. Die. For. if you're any sort of breakfast person. If you're anywhere near Tampa, this bakery is definitely worth a visit!!"
4,Great place that you can go to anytime and feel known. The food is good and the beer is cold. They have had some turnover but the servers are great and friendly. I always enjoy coming here.
4,"After an attempt to show off on a skiing trip I made an appointment with Dr. Shapiro. Dr. Shapiro quickly made me feel comfortable and at ease and always took time to explain what he was doing and why he was doing it (which is really important to me). During our visits he gave me recommendations for sleeping, working out, and other ways to get my back in better shape. As I began to feel better Dr. Shapiro never ""pressured"" me to keep coming back."
4,"This place was good. A friend took me here and I had never had thai food before. Must say I was not disappointed. I got a sushi bowl and it had 4 types of sushi (white fish, yellow tail, salmon, and I can't remember the fourth) there was about 3-4 pieces each. It's a little cramped but not like you feel you're on top of each other. I will be back for sure."
3,"This is the Salvation Army gallery store, meaning you will primarily find ""nicer"" (we all know this is subjective) clothing brands/styles, furniture, some collectables, jewelry and a spotting of housewares in what looks to be a little converted cottage. Coffee beans are sold here for some reason, too. Yes, this place is small, but i've had good luck on a occasion--either i walk out of here with nothing or i find one or two things that are a total score(!), never an in between."
4,I love spicy food.   The volumes of food are big like me.  I feel a bit awkward not understanding Chinese.  Ice cream can soothe your palate afterwards.  Will be back!
0,Flowers Express was recommended to me for my moms birthday. I called in and had her Birthday Bouquet delivered to her at work. This was suppose to be a very special thing i do for her on her Birthday that she looks forward to getting. It was 49.99 and I upgraded and pd a total of 74.00. To.my surprise when I saw the arrangement I was totally amazed. It had wilted roses and I could have went to Kroger and bought something way cheaper that looked alot better.
4,"The new location is excellent and I'm glad that it's so nearby. The work they do is excellent, and I always come out of a massage feeling excellent. I scheduled an appointment for my fiancé as a gift for her birthday, we'll be coming back regularly as a treat."
1,Wow - busy night downtown so we visited one of our favorite chains - sat  at the bar with fruit flies as our company - not very busy compared to other close places - we should have realized - food came out cold and not all that tasty. Several other customers also complaining about food.  Not a good night.  But lots of tvs and games to watch!
4,"After a previous misadventure with another St Louis sushi place, I was wary of trying another. Luckily my girlfriend found this place amd blew me away.

Solid well banded pieces of salmon nigiri, some amazing specialty rolls and free sake for checking in with Yelp. Just well done all around. Service was friendly and prompt for lunch.

I cannot recommend leaving space for dessert enough. The strawberry cheesecake roll was absolutely delicious, and much lighter than you would expect from cheesecake."
2,"I always want to like this place more than I wind up doing. Maybe that's because it is in a beautiful building in a historic part of town.   The food is decent but over priced.  They are better at sandwiches than they are at salads.  Just had the $10 Caprese salad which was mainly just lettuce with a little bit of bread, a wee bit mozzarella, and a tad of tomato.  Pretty skimpy for $10.  It seems that this place is mostly frequented by tourists.  South Coast Deli is a better choice."
0,"If I could provide zero stars I would.  I was a new customer who just moved, my trash was picked up two days late even after confirming the day.  Since we just moved and the trash was picked up late, we had a few extra bags, all combined and tied and boxes flatten and tied together.  Instead of taking them the trash and recycling people threw them out of their way to only take the cans and left everything else. Now we have more trash to be picked up and no resolution.  Terrible terrible trash company."
3,"I have been to a toast location before, but this was my first time visiting the Decatur location. I wasn't overly impressed by the service. The food was good and was served warm. Parking is tough nearby, so be prepared. My table enjoyed the abelskivers with Nutella and also the fried oysters with avocado and sriracha mayo on toast. I would recommend both of those options, and I would visit again."
4,"We had a wonderful experience from the food right down to the friendly and prompt service. Jambalaya was done to perfection and the shrimp etouffe was perfectly cooked with an excellent sauce and rice. Seafood gumbo was fantastic with the right mix of seafood and okra, also perfectly cooked with a great texture. Shrimp in the etouffe dish was firm, clean, and very fresh tasting.

Bread pudding with praline sauce was a perfect complement to the meal, as was the Cafe du Monde coffee with the dessert. One of our top two dining experiences during our NOLA visit!"
3,Nice pub.  They have a nice patio.  Lots of room inside.  Long bar counter for the regulars. The server with the pink hair was a sweetheart. They have booths.  The staple pub fare was good.  They even have curry if you want that. They have cider too.  There is a stage for music.  Free parking out front. TVs for sports.
4,"We just stopped here for some breakfast before ou running errands. Not only are the donuts fantastic, but the service was excellent! They even threw in a couple free glazed donuts. We tried the regular glazed, maple, red velvet cake, blueberry cake, and lemon-filled. Blueberry cake was the best but they were all very yummy! We'll definitely come back again!"
4,Have taken out from here multiple times. Great Mediterranean food. Haven't had a bad meal yet. Try the falafel sandwich!
4,This is the best - best- best Mexican food in the city! They have a great seafood selection and the best GUACAMOLE I have ever tasted. Great service too! 5 stars!
4,"Best Thai dinner in a long time! We ordered takeout on a Wednesday night near 9 pm and it was amazing. The yellow curry was fresh, vegetables crunchy and full of flavor. The spring rolls were great and the beef noodles were awesome. We have been here several times but this was off charts great!"
3,"I'm a big fan of Uncle Bud's.

If you're looking for Catfish, this is the place to go. However, oddly enough - I think their best menu items is not their catfish!

My personal favorite is some of their shrimp choices. The calabash shrimp has an excellent spice level, and delicious flavor. Paired with the creole sauce it makes a very delectable menu choice.

I would also say this place has my favorite hush-puppies in the area."
4,"Can't be better. 

If you're complaining about spending $6 on a great burger, just go to McNausea and get a $1 ptomaine special. 

Or go across the street to Village Whiskey and pay $26 for a burger."
3,"Love their happy hour - you can get out under $30 (with drinks!) and have a great meal with some pretty decent rolls.  

Service is usually pretty friendly, although the area for the happy hour seating is small.  We're here a few times a month and have always had a good time."
4,"Best Mediterranean around....Grilled chicken patter outstanding. Chicken was juicy and tender. Platter came with rice which I passed on. My plate was filled with fresh Greek salad, home made hummus, chicken, and side of warm pita included. My partner finished every bite his beef gyro platter. We shared a PISTACHIO baklava which was tender, flakey, and just the right amount of sweetness. Delicious! If you're looking for fresh food this is the place. They deliver too!"
1,$30 for the drycleaning of two pieces of clothing? Have you lost your mind? This isn't LA or NYC.
4,"Service and food were excellent!  We so enjoyed our ceviche, half chicken, and corderito norteño (lamb shanks). 

We will definitely be back--highly recommend this family-owned restaurant!"
3,"I reakly enjoyed this place, the service was really good and so was the food. I had the calamri that was super fresh and lighty fried it was so good. And the ricotta and honey jar was banginnnnn!!!!! Idk if it was housemade ricotta but it sure tasted like it. I also tried the lamb pizza unfortunately i wasnt too happy with it the lamb was dry and the crust was a little flimsy but other then that i loved everything and i definitely will be returning"
4,This place is completely legit. Went in at 10:15 on a Wednesday night. Place was about half full. I got the pork vegetable rolls and the pho tai and they were both great. Service was good and super fast and there weren't any people standing around doing nothing like some of these other reviews mentioned. Will definitely go back.
3,This is a hard one to review.  I do like the hotel for the price.  Front desk staff are very nice and the ppl that clean the room are great.  BEWARE if you stay here.  If you choose a room beach side the hotel next door has the loudest parties every night.  Light show as well.  I would stay again here because of staff but maybe next time would stay on other side.
0,dished out a burrito super fast & it was very cold & not good. very gross & barely ate it. this place was great before but loss it's touch. very disappointed.
3,"Now these are some serious sandos!  HUGE!  And delicious.  You get what you pay for as you'll be successfully full when you leave.  They have great soups as well.  And you can get them in yummy bread bowls, which is exactly what I would recommend.  There beer selection is extensive and the bartenders are awesome!  Say hi to Billy for me if you make it in!"
4,Our best meal was at this restaurant . Everything from start to finish was A+. We even got a private tour of the kitchen and wine cellar! The best of the best!
4,"Great teachers

My daughter went up two grades and is doing 8th grade algebra.  It is not cheap but it is very well done in terms of teaching and coaching."
4,"Great place for a smoothie or light lunch.  Stop in anytime but especially today (their charitable ""flip-flop day)."
1,"All the sauces are the same and sweet. Murg makhani, murg korma, and malai kofta all had the same curry base. It was like they cooked the chicken and threw it into the sauce. Chicken and paneer was cooked well though. Not chewy. Nothing is spicy even if you ask for it. Naans are good."
2,The best thing to mark this place is the variety.  Had the Ahi tuna plate.  Tasty. My husband had the meatloaf. Ordinary was the way he described it.
4,"This is by far my favorite dive bar in Center City - I wish I had found it sooner! Prices are very cheap for Center City (for example, they have a rotating $3.25 draft and $3 shot), and the crowd is really chill. Additionally, the food is great. They have many televisions which are constantly playing sports, and the bartenders are really nice."
4,"This is my favorite place for Sunday brunch because it's relatively close...  great food, and unlimited mimosas...  Plus great people take care of me at the bar...  Alex and Shayna really take good care of me..."
2,"Based on all of the rave reviews, I had high hopes for this bakery.
It was about $25 for two sandwiches and a crab cake.  The only tasty item that was memorable was the crab cake.   It was hot, fresh, crispy, and salty.  

If you are coming here for a guava pastry or a regular cannoli, call ahead early in the morning and reserve it ahead of time."
2,This place lacks customer service. Menu states you can create your own trio yet they told me I couldn't. It is in bold on the menu that you can. Prices on the menu aren't accurate. Said one price yet I was charged more then when I asked they mentioned some extra charge. Not sure where it came from. Curry goat jerk chicken and plantains. Curry is delicious as was the chicken. Rice is pretty bland. I feel like it's way overpriced I'll be looking for another Jamaican restaurant to try.
3,We where there on a Saturday the dining room was full. Marco took our name meanwhile grabbed a drink across the street.  Had a seat in about 15 minutes. Food was excellent service was great. I highly recommend this place. Pro tip in cold weather the dinning room may not be the warmest do to position of the door to your table but that's the only criticism I have about this place.
2,"NOT OPEN 24 HOURS AT 6:41AM Wednesday 8/8, not was the other Bully's on Pyramid/Eagle Canyon.
I didn't see any ""cleaning"" signs and the doors were locked."
4,"This place is RAD! Thank you Yelp! for putting it on my radar! I brought a church youth group here for dinner a couple months back. Everyone loved it. I was impressed by the unique and tasty flavor-combinations! The owner, Dave, was present and was super helpful! Great guy. Great food! I'll be back."
2,Ordered the steak and shrimp...which was great and prepared well. The sushi however... nothing I would order twice. Same to be true for the udon soup my daughter ordered. Way too much seaweed. Just overpowered everything.
4,Since Sushi on roll left downtown. Downtown was in need of a new sushi spot! This is very upscale restaurant without taking a huge hit out of your wallet! Their happy hour beats Sushi Garden all you can eat special! Non happy hours can be a bit pricey but I feel its worth it! The food is excellent and the service is on point! Definitely one of my faves!!
4,"A Garden Party came recommended by our wedding venue, ICONA Avalon, after we pivoted from our big city wedding amidst the pandemic and decided to do a microwedding at the beach with our family and bridal party.  I cannot describe how beautiful the flowers were that Mary, Dawn and their team developed for our wedding.  The bouquets were gorgeous, they supplied a perfect driftwood arbor for our beach ceremony and the decor was exquisite.  Plus, they were the easiest vendor to work with - I cannot sing their praises enough, their work is second to none!"
3,"Not worth the price for dinner. Same as the lunch buffet. Food was fresh and tasty at lunch. I was very satisfied. Lunch cost more than I expected, but drinks are included in the price."
3,"They bring out these amazing mini corn bread muffins before your order arrives.  They have a whole bunch of really unique flavours which you will probably never see anywhere else.  I thought that was a really nice touch.
I had the gumbo and thought that it was top drawer, I would get a bucket of the stuff next time.   

The service is really good too, very friendly and helpful."
4,I stayed in Madeira Beach for a few days at the beginning of April for a quick getaway from the depths of winter in MN.  I participated in the beach yoga one morning and yoga on the patio another morning. Both sessions were lovely and exactly what I was looking for. I used my own towel for the beach yoga and they had mats to borrow at the studio for the patio session. The instructors were attentive to all of the participants' needs. The citrus towelette at the end of each session was a nice touch.  I would highly recommend attending a class if you are in the area.
0,"Ok so I finally got a chance to try this much anticipated, most talked about, lines outside of the door and around the corner burger spot. I wasn't impressed at all, I ordered a double shack burger with bacon, and a order of cheese fries. I don't think you could mess up cheese fries but they are a first. I recommend they change the cheeses at least . The burger was small, greasy, not really impressive for what I've heard. I will be back to give the rest of the menu a try."
4,"Great service and a good variety...at all times. The French cruellers (sp?) are my favorite but the raised with sprinkles are the most popular. If you are looking for a special occasion alternative to cake, try one of their giant donuts. They are not too expensive and they will write on them for you. Worth a stop in if you're in the mood for a donut."
3,"Mrs. E and I stopped for a little din din after a long day on the road of our most resent road trip. This place was handy being across the street from our hotel. Long story short everything was just outstanding. She had the Tia steak salad, and I went with the fire roasted chicken. I ate every bite of mine and went after some of hers. Great meals, and really nice people. Would absolutely go back and order those dishes a second time."
4,"If you're in the mood for Brazilian food but don't want to pay fogo de chao prices, come here and try their delicious food. If you love the cheese bread, you will love it here. Taste just as good and is warm and soft and the cheese isn't overwhelming. I also tried the chimichurri beef fries and they were also so good and flavorful. The only sad part was I thought it was supposed to have the grilled onions. I really want to try their steak sandwich. It looks so bomb. Will update my review when I try the sandwich."
0,"With the outdoor tiki environment, this place should be a gold mine, but the unattentive service, piss poor management, and watered down, overpriced drinks would normally be enough to sink a place in within a year.  We live only 2 miles away, but we won't be back.  Plenty of competition in the area, so I think it's only a matter of time before people wise up and find a better option.  We have."
4,We have been to Cappy's twice and both times the breakfast have been excellent. The Waitresses are all very sweet. The waitresses are happy to get you what you want. The prices were good. The eggs were made perfect they were not scorched or burnt.
2,"We are there last night for the first time. There were 4 of us.  The appetizers (meatballs and empanadas were very good.  We had 3 good dinners, and though the rib eye was good, we felt it was way overpriced.  The filet was good, and was the special, so worth it.  I had the short ribs and was really disappointed. The meat was flavorless  and the dish was boring. Service was good but not great. Enjoyed our evening, though unlikely to go there again."
3,"Very classy atmosphere for Sunday brunch with very good service.  Ordered take-out, including a burger off menu without any trouble and it was ready in less than 15 minutes.  I think the lobster mac-n-cheese will kill me (rich) but it sure was good. Conveniently located near Trader Joe's and Whole Foods."
2,"Great, authentic items from France. But holy cow, y'all! I've never felt so pressured to buy a tablecloth in all my life! Get that sales lady a job at a car lot! I'm just a tourist browsing around town in a rainy day, not really in the market for a teflon-coated tablecloth. When she couldn't sell me on that, she had some napkins..then some knives made by the guy who made knives for Napoleon. We are trying to browse..."
4,"I like slushee-type of drinks, and they make the mango flavor here. It's not actual slushie, but when they blend it they put a good amount of ice to make it that sort of texture. Not a lot of bubble tea shops do that! This is my favorite bubble tea shop so far."
0,"I've never experienced such awful customer service from a business in my life! First- I had to call to confirm my appointment, as they did not call me. After arriving, they were not friendly and insisted that they did not have time to wash my hair. With that said- there were NO other clients in the salon (on New Year's Eve of all times!!). A very odd and strange experience. I left and did not get a service!! Do not go here."
4,"Purchasing the car was a breeze. 

Staff was friendly. Service staff is also friendly and will take the time to set up a follow up appointment if needed. 

Great place to buy a car."
4,I called three of the big name locksmiths in town and non of them would guarantee me my building would be re-keyed before five - I called All American and they had two vans here in time to get the project done before we close our shop at five.  The people are friendly and they answered the phone quickly and showed appreciation for my business.  I was also pleasantly surprised with my bill- they are very fair with their pricing.  One of our doors is over 70 years old with some really bizarre hardware but these guys didn't even question it they were able to make everything work.
3,"ONLY ORDER PIZZA!!!

Although Venezia has some great pizza, most of the dishes on the rest of the menu are terrible."
0,"We were driving by with the family and decided to get a dinner at the buffet around 6 pm on Sunday. We paid upfront (i wish we would check the food in advance) , most of the trays were empty and quality of food was BAD. 
The stuff was super unfriendy!! 
When I asked if they have coffee the servant looked st me like I asked for something extraordinary!! 
What a waste of $81!"
4,"Burger, potato, monsoon! Im good. Give me another monsoon and its ALL GOOD. Cool atmosphere and true nola tradition"
2,"Food was decent. Salsa was spicy. I couldn't get past the musty smell of the restaurant, which I think is from the previous inhabitants."
4,"This is the best breakfast place in Santa Barbara! The food is delicious, and the staff is very considerate and kind. I ordered the breakfast burrito, and it was the bomb! I would obviously come here again, because I feel at home here, and I enjoy the happy vibe as I walked in. If you are looking for a place to eat breakfast, I highly recommend this place."
2,"As far as bratwurst goes you can't get much better. If you're looking for a quiet dinner this isn't the place, but if you're looking to party a little before the week it's a solid choice."
3,"Don't usually review big chains, but since this particular Mellow Mushroom is on Broadway, Honky Tonk Row, in downtown Nashville, figured I throw a review out.

The pizza was good, not the best, but still good.

The star of the show was the live music they had performing at 11:00 on a Sunday morning. Kaylee Rose was playing and if you like country music, check her out. She played some covers, but also an original song she wrote that was really good. 

So in summary, the pizza is fine, the music, great."
4,Best cheesesteaks anywhere!!!!  A hidden Jewell in Carneys point!!!  If you're on 295 N/S and need to eat check them out!!!!
3,Chinese food Thursday $6.99 50% bottle of wine 7.99 tankards of Bud and Bud light. $6.99 basket of jumbo shrimp
4,"Great food buy eat it there- they don't seem equipped for take out, and the Panang curry spilled everywhere.
Order it medium hot or it's a bit bland, shrimp is perfect"
4,"This was our first time here based off of recommendations from neighbors. Got the chapata channa and goat curry with samosas and naan. Food tasted fresh, good variety, reasonably priced and good portion size.  It was really really busy on a Sunday evening which is nice to see you as I hope this restaurant does well.  Will return."
0,"This bank LOST my safety deposit box information when they ""transitioned their data systems"".  I can't access our family deposit box any longer.  I can't recommend this location to anybody looking for a reputable bank."
4,Julie is very good with customer service and is willing to make adjustments as necessary.
4,"Tastes soooooo fresh! Amazing place. Please take a reservation, otherwise...you know. Pricy? Yes. Worth it? Yes."
4,"This review is only for happy hour.... however we talk about doing actual dinner there often.  

We really dig the bar & margs here.... great happy hour too - I believe it's 1/5 price on margs all Tuesday. 

Their chips & salsa bar with beans is delicious- which makes it hard to order food; I'll review once we do."
3,The service was good. I had multiple orders for a large party and they were able to accommodate pretty quickly. I had the Cesar with chicken salad and it was a pretty healthy portion of salad with quite a bit of chicken.   The rest of the party had other different dishes that all look well-made and fresh.  That atmosphere was very clean and accommodating.
4,"Awesome find in the french quarter! Delicious and super authentic, reminded me a lot of when I used to live in Mexico City. Can't recommend this place enough, especially the chicken tinga and the enfrijoladas. And don't sleep on the homemade tortilla chips!"
1,Food was great. The service really ruined the experience. It's been two days since and I'm still appalled. Ridiculously disrespectful. Get it together.
4,"Wow!  Southern home cooking at its best!  I go to Nashville once a year and this is the best part of the trip.  The food and service are amazing and the cool little shops are a must to check out.  Also, it is right next to the best bike trail in the Midwest...the Natchez Trace Parkway."
0,Disgusting...not sure what is in my ice cube - you know the restaurant is dirty when there is miscellaneous objects imbedded in the ice cubes.
4,"Excellent!  Very good, tasty, and fresh. I had beef shawarma plate. It was perfect: all spiced just the right way. My friends had tuna with baba ghanouj and fresh veggies. Finally I haven't had real coffee with cardamon in a very long time. It was perfect. Coupled with friendly owners and clean environment, it was a winning combination."
3,"Good food and good service. Small/local spot for Mediterranean food, can be a bit over priced for what you are getting. Definitely a lunch spot or quick take-out dinner"
1,"I use the post office a lot, and my expectations are simply to not lose my packages and answer the phone when I call.  Eagle USPS does these things.  They also have a self serve station.  They would have three stars except they employ the most rude, crabby ladies imaginable.  When I walk in, I feel like MacBeth approaching the Fates."
1,The food and drinks are good.   The service is terrible.  I have been here a few times and it always takes a while for someone to just get my drink order.   My other complaint is the live music.  The volume level is extremely loud.  So loud to the point you can't hear the person you are eating with.   I recommend the volume be turned way down.   It is very annoying.
4,Best rolls in the game. Nice receptionist.  Great waiting staff. My waitress Sarah made sure our drinks were never empty.  She was also pretty knowledgeable about the town since I just moved here.
4,Had a very warm welcome from Hy today!(I hope I spelled that correctly) Great service and great food. Will come again :)
3,The B& B was awesome especially with the French fries but the slaw needs a little bit more Mayo. Herb chicken salad was good but it was very small for the price. Got. A LIT and had to return it but every thing was good and would come back
4,Delicious Indian food. I have been here for lunch and dinner. For dinner I always order the malai kofta and it's amazing. The lunch buffet is also great (and so affordable!) with a ton of tasty selections.
2,"We had the beet salad and tomato soup. Salad was good, but don't expect any extras. No bread, toast, or crackers. Just a salad. As for the tomato soup, don't waste your $4. It was a very basic small bowl containing a tomato-like substance. Bland! A little on the loud side. Now we know..."
3,"This is a great breakfast/brunch option in the area (like if you just need to go to Costco:)! 
Prices are very reasonable and portion sizes are generous. Can't go wrong with a crepe! Service was remarkably friendly and prompt - would definitely come back!"
1,"Lack of service, food quality is medium plus you have to wait. I dont understand how this place is open, lol!"
4,AMAZING. The crawfish are perfectly spoiled and black. I puke every time I eat here from food poisoning. Highly recommend.
2,"It was an enjoyable brunch, I am not sure it rates all of the hype of many of the reviews but it is a soiled place."
4,Burgers are awesome! Affordable prices for families on a budget.  Highly recommend the tacos or burritos.  Happy hour deals were great as well! Great atmosphere.  Highly recommend!
1,How can such a new place be so dirty. Food and service are ok but dirty restrooms and overflowing trash cans are not. The workers seem good but the management needs to change
4,"Flying Fish, I might love you more now that I can get Exit 16 filled in my growler straight from the brewery! 

The brewery has moved from Cherry Hill to Somerdale and now includes a really awesome tasting room where you can buy growlers (note- FF will only fill their own growlers, which are $5 a pop) and kegs and six packs and 750s. They just started offering tours of the new space recently though I haven't had the pleasure to take one yet, I'm sure they are just as awesome as before."
2,"Was very excited to order the red snapper, thinking that it would be fresh caught; however it was a frozen fillet.  Entree was fairly expensive and not as good as it could have been.  My friend ordered the fish tacos and thought that her entree was prepared from frozen fish as well.  Otherwise service was fine, and view while dining was superb."
2,"The place was practically empty when we got there for a recent lunch. Our table got toasted ravioli, chili cheese fries, a Greek omelette, and a patty melt. The food was ok, nothing fancy. Service was the same. On a previous visit we got a plate of chicken tenders and a sandwich with onion rings. Both times I had a Groupon, but I don't think I'd come here otherwise."
4,Great food at a great price. Always enough to go around for 2 in one combo meal. A favorite for carry out
3,"can't say it is cheaper than supermarkets because it really depends on if the stuffs you are going to buy are on sale or not. However, average prices are still cheaper than supermarkets but with shorter shelf life."
4,"Best Italian food in town, and half the price of some other places. I always measure a good Italian place based on their veal, and boy does Mama's deliver. Perfectly thin, lightly sauced and cooked until almost tender, you can actually taste and enjoy the meat. Other places smother it with meat sauce and about a pound of cheese, which is a waste. I highly recommend!!!"
4,"I love the French Quarter, all of it. The good the bad and the ugly. It warms my heart to walk through these streets. New Orleans is a fun loving city of contrasts, and you will see many of them in this condensed area. This place is one of the finest and most unique in all of these United States. I will always want to return."
4,I arrived slightly before my appointment time and I didn't not wait long at all. I was there for a dermaplane with Tazha and she did not disappoint! She was very friendly and I felt comfortable it being my first time doing anything to my face. The dermaplane also comes with a facial which I think is great for the price. She even addressed my dark spots and gave me a serum to help even it out. I loved the result and I will definitely be going back!
4,"This place is the retail location www.miniaturemarket.com, which sells a vast amount of board games, tabletop games, role playing games etc.

There are many games for rent for $15/hour. They provide gaming tables and there's a vending machine for snacks.  I think it's a very cool way to hang out with family and friends.

Prices are cheaper here too, even compared to Amazon.

Located in Manchester road, right next to Edwards Carpet. Easy parking."
2,"Hit or miss. The place is always overcrowded and slightly overpriced. Among the other options in the near vicinity,this one is at the top of the list. Be prepared to pay for valet or search for parking."
3,Found this place accidentally !  And so glad we did!  Live the atmosphere and the staff was amazing... friendly and helpful. The food was hearty and plentiful. And the coffee came in a bottomless cup!  We will be back!
1,Not impressed at all. Wesley chapel toyota is much better. Just moved in this area but would rather make the drive to new tampa to avoid this place. Didnt get a scent of customer service :(
2,Diane is a great professional and professional. No comment of the rude and uncaring owner.
0,"Was fairly busy evening just before happy hour on last Thursday, was having a good time with friends when I witnessed the server ... maybe manager being extremely rude to a customer who appeared to calm and not deserving the attitude.  Wow!!! Don't bring it to work next time!!!"
4,"This is my favorite one stop food place. It's good for breakfast or lunch and great for groups because everybody can pick what the want and then sit together.The gyros are amazing, the cheesesteaks are great, and don't forget to get dessert at Beiler's donuts!"
4,"Great place to watch the Saints game! Nice locals bars recommended by our AirBnB Neighbor. Good drinks, friendly bartenders and patrons. Reasonable prices. The outside patio is nice but all the seats were filled when we got there. The whole place was pretty packed actually so get there early if you want a seat. They had someone making Pad Thai outside all day too if you got hungry. We didn't have any but it smelled good!"
0,Worse place ever! Their food is disgusting the beans were old the meat was horrible and the rice was hard. The guacamole salsa was watered down.NEVER go here!!
0,Poor customer service. Never keep their schedule. Always late with no reason. Never explain what are the issues you always have to keep contacting them.
4,Every dish was delicious. I loved this place. Must go in Santa Barbara. I recommend you get the Lamborghinis and sweet potato Fries :)
4,After 6 years of being disappointed by nail salons around the city I finally found this place. I don't know how I never managed to go here before now because they do an incredible job! So happy with how these ombré dip powder nails (with glitter!) turned out - and for a great price. This will definitely be my regular place from now on.
4,"I'm so glad I was introduced to Adam at Brandon Insurance.
He has saved me so much money on my car insurance as well as my home insurance. It has been so much easier to work with Adam compared to the big-name insurance companies. Adam is readily available in very timely with responding to you. Highly recommend speaking with Brandon Insurance if you're looking for vehicle and/or home insurance in Florida. Thanks Adam."
0,"Food was terrible. We went in & ordered several breakfast items. Our hash browns were completely burned, literally black/charred. The pancakes were soggy, eggs had no flavor. I don't know how anyone could eat here. Asked for some things to be omitted from my plate, they weren't! Would definitely not recommend this place. 1 star for the apple juice!"
3,Been here several times over the past few years. Consistently good quality. I especially love the spicy szechuan soup noodle.
1,"Slightly better than Geno's in my opinion.  This is because this version had more meat for the same price.  However, hugely disappointed in how bland cheesesteaks taste.  I regret not going on Yelp and finding a joint that it known for something that more flavor and dimension for the same price."
3,"I have shopped with HSN for some time now. Love the jewelry, electronics, and also have not had any issues with returning anything. 

Customer service is always willing to help out, and the value I get for the unique products are really great. 

I had no IDEA it was located in ST. Pete, but now I know! 

Especially love the Joy Mangano line for luggage and bags, and IMAN for jewelry, and clothing. I love some of the new things from Twiggy London as well. 

Some really great and unique finds. I usually order online. Love it!!!"
4,I walked 23 mins to get to this place and it was well worth it. The food was so good that I stuffed myself.
3,"Open 365 24/7 with 50 lanes. Countless leagues for all skill levels.  Decent arcade w/ tickets for the kids. 

They could use more lane ball finger sizes for those adults with bigger hands and who don't have their own ball.

Steppys bar is on the premises w/ decent food and drinks. It is a little pricey. It is standard american food."
0,Other nail salons in the area were all booked and Lucy Lee had openings all day. I was in a crunch and thought why not try somewhere new and I quickly realized why they were the only nail salon not completely booked. The quality of my gel manicure is horrible and I went home and immediately soaked it off. My nails are now way shorter than they were when I walked into the salon (not per my request) and I have multiple cuts on my fingers from the manicure. Do not go here.
3,"Didn't try any of the prepated food, but ginormous selection of by single bottle.  Interesting range of food and snack food including coffee and chocolate Rx Bars and Essentia water, all at decent prices."
3,Food was good in taste and quality. The options on the menu were good for lunch or dinner and pretty diverse. The interior is nicely designed and the staff are attentive. My only criticism is that it's pricy but on the flip side the portions are slightly more than you'd get in some other similar restaurants.  Plus the smoky atmosphere from the casino drifts in and may not be comfortable for non-smokers.
4,"Cute little place in a Summerfield strip mall. Easily overlooked. Friendly atmosphere, great sushi prepared in front of you, good lunch prices."
4,"Yummy pizza, cheese steak egg roles, poke tuna bowls and beer, beer beer   This is a must try for lunch with friends or a casual night out"
1,Just went there for lunch. Service is very fast and friendly but the garlic chicken had a lake of sauce underneath it and the white rice was gummy.
2,"6-17-16: Accidentally ordered the chicken marsala again. The sauce is too sweet! Replaced it with my usual cheese enchiladas, which my daughter and I enjoyed. Jason enjoys the Ruben sandwich. Classic meal he orders every time."
2,"Well my prickly pear mimosa was great! However, they were out of everything and every other option I wanted. So maybe next time they'll be fully stocked with my food desires. Other than that I wound up settling for spinach and Brussels sprouts and Mac and cheese which were ok. I'm not vegetarian I actually wanted meat and they were all out."
4,"Great prices, great food, and good sized portions.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE their octopus.  They grill it, slice it thinly, and it has a wonderful smoky tender taste.  Also their mediterranean plate is so big, delicious, fresh, and filling."
4,"Great find right by the Ucsb campus.  
Food is great, atmosphere great and service great.
We will definitely make this a tradition on our visits to Ucsb."
0,"If I can give them less than a one star I would!!!!!!! I got my nails dip last week, not even few days after I got them done, they started breaking!!!! The dip is  very thin. I had gel last longer then this!!! Keep in my mind I Have not done any heavy lifting, cleaning,  nail chewing etc. I don't understand how this nail just completely came off not even a week later! I am very disappointed because I use to recommend this place to all my friends! This is definitely my last time!"
3,"Beer list and cocktail list are both amazing. The decor and ambiance are a trip back in time.  The food is also very good, and unique.  Some dishes were far beyond my tastes, but everything is prepared very well and service is one of the best in the city.  

Negatives here are the prices and the clientele.  Some very snobby people each time I have been and they remind me why I left the service industry."
0,1 word... horrible. I went to the hairdresser and showed her the haircut I wanted but she looked at it for 1 second and started chopping my hair. After she finished it looked horrible and they up-charged SO MUCH. I had to wear a hat for three-weeks straight! If you desperately need a haircut and want to come here I would rather recommend you rip your hair out instead because that would probably look better.
3,"Not that this place needs another review but it is definitely a great spot to grab an affordable bite to eat and drink that's pretty as well.  Most of the Frenchy's around town are pretty good and relatively reasonable.   Definitely recommend the smoked fish dip, it's very good."
4,Hands down one of the best meals I've had in a long time.  Smoked salmon sandwich (Zipper) was out of this world as well as the J. Cunningham - quinoa salad.   An absolute must try -
3,"It's always good to stop in and eat at Bartaco, the food is really good and the house margaritas make you want more then just one. I would recommend coming in and trying Bartaco out."
4,"This place is a diabetics worse nightmare. Their sweets are completely off the hook. I try my best to just order one or two items but I always leave with about two boxes of goodies. I've never had a bad experience, bad customer service or bad meal. This place is completely to die for."
4,In my opinion this King Cake is top 3 in the city bar none! The bakery is solid and I like their macaroons too. If you get here during King Cake season do yourself a favor and go with the Pecan Praline.
1,"I really didn't expect Tucanos to be this way, I've been wanting to go to this restaurant for a long time and thought it would be very authentic. I lived in Brazil for several years and the quality of food was really bad at this restaurant. The service was really bad as well. I will never return to any other Tucanos Brazilian Grill in the future."
3,"I am a Pats guy.  Genos is great, but Pats has more meat on their sandwich.  That's about it, that's all it takes for me."
0,"Zero stars not an option.The worst taco bell I've ever been to. Horrible wait times. I tried giving it a chance since its on my end of town, but it's become inconvenient to wait 20+ minutes for a 4 item order. Unless absolutely necessary, STAY AWAY!"
4,They did a good job cleaning the car and spent extra time on the roof getting stuff off that accumulated from the car being parked under a tree. Very professional. Was a little slow but that was due to coming in on s busy Saturday afternoon and the car needing more attention than usual.
3,Classic old school burger joint. Don't come here if your looking for McDonald's! They cook your burger over hot charcoal just like the grill in your backyard. So has that smoky flavor and chili is really tasty! I will return to try the smoky sauce. I didn't hear about how good it was till after I ordered!! Great place to visit! You can tell it's been there for decades!
4,"Stephen Dunne made something negative such as filing for bankruptcy into a great experience. Throughout the whole process he was always responsive to questions not matter how many I had, explained what was necessary at every step and truly helped me navigate the process without feeling overly stressed or bad for having to file in the first place. Something daunting turned out to be rather easy. I can wholeheartedly recommend him to anyone who considers filing for bankruptcy."
4,delicious and amazing! i came with non-vegan friends while on vacation and we all loved it!! seriously though my friends surprised me lol i had the falafel which were perfectly crispy on the outside with an awesome flavor. they had burgers and were raving about them  the drinks were all super tasty too! we tried to go back again but they were closing. we will definitely return in the future! i can't wait to try more foods and the gluten free desserts
3,"I think I'm on storage unit #4 (have previously leased several diff sizes over the years) and have never had an issue at all.  No water issues, no rodents, no hassels, break-ins or any thing negative at all.  Security system is great and easy to use.  Yesterday I met a storage neighbor who was keeping a mint 68 Shelby in his storage space.  Great guy and awesome car."
4,"The burgers and service here has always been top notch! In! I love the estate burger and onion rings. It doesn't matter whether I'm dining in or order through uber eats, the food is always fresh and delicious. We have yet to have a bad meal here! Highly recommend for a great burger!"
4,"Old School style, customer comes first business. Did a great job tackling a semi-custom install on an unusual part (glass replacement/eliminator) on my Lotus Evora. Top Notch work, good customer service. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend right away, and if I ever need an insurance claim, I'll use them."
4,"When in New Orleans for a weekend my friends and I were looking for refuge from the sweltering heat. The first place we found was Marigny Brasserie. It was an oasis, cool air, amazing food, incredibly friendly and helpful staff and most of all cheap prices. i am generally a very hard person to please as can be seen by my other reviews, but this restaurant stole my heart and I cannot say enough about it."
3,"Went on a Friday night.  There was quite a line but well worth the wait.
It was CRAB LEGS!  They were top notch Crab Legs.  The buffet features a dessert island and I sampled it all.  Best Crab Legs I have had in a long time."
4,"In love with Poke Bowls thanks to this place.  Discovered it last week, and I have been here 3 times already.  It's like the Asian version of Chipotle.  Great price, I highly recommend it!"
0,"if you looking for a place that can apply hair color in matter of minutes and you don't care about results, this is place for you. I never seen anybody applying color as fast as owner of this salon. end result some grey not covered and owner never checked or offered me to fix it. Stay away from this place"
4,"I was recommended to have a po' boy here by a local, and oh lordy lord, it was incredible. I had the vegetarian french fries po' boy, and I still dream about it (haha). This is definitely one of my favorite spots in NOLA, and the staff were so incredibly sweet and friendly. I'm coming back here everytime I'm in NOLA!"
4,"Had food delivered from this restaurant for work.  The food was actually still warm and I was quite impressed at the char on the poblano peppers and the chicken.  And these were all wrapped in a homemade tasting tortilla.  And people wonder why I can't eat Taco Bell?  This taco is a perfect example why, haha.  
The salsa on the side was fresh and came with both red and green flavors. 
A great option for lunch when your in the office!"
4,"So far so good. I bought my first Alfa two weeks ago and the test drive, negotiation and delivery experience was great."
3,"Great papusas! I haven't tried anything else because the papusas are so good, but there always are locals in the place getting food that looks excellent."
4,"Great location, friendly staff and has an amazing overlook of the Bourbon Street. The open roof seating area has the advantage of live music from the bars below. I had the Mambo's blackened red fish, which was perfect."
4,"Food was very good and tasted fresh. I had the smothered chicken, macaroni and cheese and collards. Wait staff were very friendly. The food was very hot (in temperature) when received. Talking to the staff and management , I was informed that they recently changed the some recipes because they received complaints that the food was too sweet. Man I wish they would bring this place back to Atlanta."
4,"Love it! All about it! The food, staffs and the decorations, especially the food :). We ordered the eggplant with garlic sauce, seafood combo and kung pao chicken. All so yummy!!!!! The seafood combo has a whole lobster tail in it. So go figure :) 

The staff was helpful and friendly.  Love the place!"
4,"Ordered thru Door dash everything was perfect
We get steak teriyaki bowl south of the border roll, fuku vegas roll, red Ninja roll , las vegas Roll
Thank You!"
3,"If you are craving sushi late at night this is the place to go! They have varieties of sushi and different dishes and they are all pretty good for the price! Their atmosphere is really pretty, looks like a good casual date place! I highly recommend their spicy Maki combo, and princess tuna!"
4,"If you're looking for fresh, clean, and delicious noms...this is the place to check out! They have a huge selection to make your own personal creations. All of the salsas and sauces they have available are made fresh daily and the staff was super friendly!"
0,No indoor seating and no use of restroom. We went elsewhere.  Realized reading yelp reviews we made the right decision.
4,"Great food and service
They are closed Tuesday's so I have  not to eat Indian food on Tuesday 
Great server always smiling"
4,"The food was amazing!!! So flavorful and fresh and at such a great price! The service was superb! They were accommodating, patient and very willing to explain and answer any questions. My family had an amazing time! Highly recommended!"
4,"Quite simply, the best consistent quality breakfast buffet on the Westbank. High quality bacon and lots of it. Fried eggs, toast, and pancakes ordered fresh from the kitchen included with the buffet. I haven't had any issues with food quality here, but I only ever go early in the morning because of work haha. Make sure you try the french toast and cinnamon stick things they're amazing.

Friendly Staff, Good people, and Good Service."
4,"As good as it gets! The pasta is fantastic. The owner is a real nice guy who gave us a free pound of pasta, after he realized we screwed up some pasta that we received in a gift basket. The rest of the staff are very nice too and very helpful."
4,SO GOOD! First of all Yardley is such a cute town. This spot has a good variety of water ice flavors and they all sound delicious. I went with a mango gelati and my fiancé got a cookies and cream water ice. I was definitely questioning cookies and cream as water ice but it was sooooo good I had to steal some from him. The frozen custard is perfection and the water ice is full of flavor. Will definitely be back to try more.
2,The food was really good and the air staff was spot on.  The challenge was they where out of several things on the menu.  Some of the things they could have went To the store and purchased it.  I have the  bourbon drink and it was really good.
4,Excellent sushi.  Had the Tataki tuna appetizer and Hanabi roll and wife had vegetable udon soup with fried egg.  Excellent service and decor.
3,"A cute and small shop, with the cupcakes cleanly displayed behind tall glass doors. The texture and moistness of the cake is lighter and more airy than the others. At the end of the day, they were out of the more interesting flavors, but when I didn't have enough cash to buy two, they surprised me with an extra cupcake in my bag! The frosting is also tasty enough to make me forget I prefer cream cheese frosting. So far this is my preferred cupcake shop in the city."
4,Best food on the beach! Pizza was phenominal. Salad was fresh. Nice sunset view. I'll be back.
4,"Best bakery in NOLA. Hands down (beating Gambino's, Haydel's, and any other local bakery by a long shot). Swiss treats you like family. My parents went to them for their own wedding and that was over 25 years ago before I was even born! Even today, they have some of the best cakes I've ever tasted. If you're not from here, you need to give this local business a look up. You won't regret it."
4,This was the first Moe's I ever went to but now we have one in spring hill just opened up this week. I will be at every Moe's Monday always.
3,"Seriously love this place!  It's got an old school Vegas vibe to it.  The waitstaff make it their goal to learn your name; which I love.  The food is great!  The portions are good.  I just think it's slightly overpriced by comparison, but that never stops us from stopping by."
3,"Awesome cronuts. Got the bites, Paris, maple and vanilla yumminess. The Biscuit and Molnar sandwiches are also terrific."
3,"A solid place to get nicer/more authentic Italian.

Atmosphere: Great outdoor seating area and Italian market with Gelato counter.

Food: Tasty & satisfying. I've had their pizza, pasta, and a couple sandwiches, which were all good overall. The fried ravioli are super tasty! The gelato is also really good.

Prices: Quite reasonable for such large portions.

Overall: A reliable little Italian place. I also love that you can shop in their market or just stop by for gelato. :)"
0,"The food is alright and being an avid diner and a die hard fan of Ethiopian food, I convinced myself to come here a third time despite the WORSE THAN TERRIBLE service. Waited 25 minutes for even a glass of water to come out after three reminders. There was no sign of the coffee or the food we ordered until much later. Mixed up the wine order and the waitresses are full of attitude. You can never find a smile on their face to expect the least. They don't deserve a fourth chance, never again!"
4,"This is my favorite neighborhood bar. It's extremely clean, the bar tenders are always sweet, and the crowd is friendly. They have free food every saints game too!"
4,Awesome. Super fresh and tasty. Chicken nicely marinated and tender. Grilled shrimp perfectly cooked. Not over cooked!!!
2,After receiving an email from the franchise owner and speaking with the manager.  They have corrected the situation.  Although I am disappointed in having to jump through hoops I am pleased that the situation was handled.  Thank you
4,Love this place. Kids loved making things with the Legos. I even went in and made something. Lol. Food and service is good. Friendly staff. Creative crafts to make and take home too. Not the Legos though. Lol
4,Our favorite brunch in town! Use the Yelp waiting list or get there right when they open since the restaurant is small!
0,Probably one of the worst Krispy Kreme's place I've ever went to. The service here is very awful and also the employees are a bit rude and do not care about the customers. Employees here are lazy and are unwilling to work.
4,"This is our happy place for lunch. Go on the weekend and enjoy the wonderful piano backdrop. Consistently scrumptious food. My favorite iced tea ever. Highlights include the cheddar jam appetizer, the Maryland She-Crab soup, melt in your mouth crab cakes, welcoming lovely atmosphere."
0,"Hosts were friendly but I was completely grossed out to see fruit flies fly the hell out of my burrito when I sliced it open... Then as I was trying my wife's nachos the same thing happened. I let them know they had a fly problem apparently and they pretty much just said, ""Okay, sorry."" No type of discount or gift card offered. Yep, no need to come back.."
4,It was our anniversary and we enjoyed perfectly-cooked filets and the hot chocolate cake and ice cream. Wonderful meal.
4,"This is my favorite butter cookie destination in the Rittenhouse area. I have a jar in my kitchen that I routinely fill with cookies from here and i especially love filling it with their themed cookies around the holidays.

Over the weekend my mom purchased several strawberry shortcake slices for a dinner party and gifted me the leftover slice. It was truly delicious.

I sometimes go to La Miel for special occasion desserts but it's more for the aesthetic than the flavor. If you want flavor - go here!"
4,A must try! Some of the freshest meats and deli products around. If you're making your own cheesesteaks this is the place to get your chip steak ( and chicken steaks too). I'm also a big fan of their hoagies and sandwiches. They have a decent selection of rolls and other deli items such as sides for your meal. I doubt you'll be disappointed.
3,"Love the atmosphere here. It can be quieter on some week nights but don't let that fool you into thinking that they aren't busy. There is usually a steady stream of people that come in. We have been here twice now and it has been great each time. This time I brought hubby and we tried the Avila arepas - their name sake with nicely cooked pork , the fried plantain and the sweet corn pancake. Really, you can't go wrong with any of their options. Also all of their arepas comes with a small side of coleslaw like salad."
4,"This is such a wonderful place. We went on a Friday at Brunch time. Had a wonderful cocktail, then appetizer of lettuce taco shrimp. It was delicious! Shrimp were cooked perfectly. Ordered the double meat burger. This was absolutely the best burger I have ever eaten! It was juicy, very tasty, cooked perfect. I came from Baton Rouge, and would definitely drive there again for the burger itself! I can't wait to go again and try the other foods!"
4,Fantastic lunch with great food and even better service. Joseph Evans was amazing. We ordered over a dozen different things and he memorized our entire order to perfection! His excellent customer service skills elevated our entire experience!
0,"Dry Patty melt. This was one of the top 3 of the waiters favorites when I asked for a recommendation.
Service ok but not good. Had to ask for napkins and ask for our bill. When I asked for the bill the waiter said the manager was going to come out & talk to me about the dry patty melt, but he never showed.
I was there as part of a networking group, so I will ask the group to find a new location."
3,"No cash, no food for you. Love this place. Awesome freshly made farm to table. My only complain, they only take cash."
4,"Food is the best!  The menu is unbelievable!  It ranges from salads and sandwiches to excellent dinners and outstanding specials.  The staff and management are genuinely friendly and interested in their customers. I have never had a bad dinner here. I have tried the breakfast, lunch and dinner and I have never been disappointed.  Every meal is a winner.  The atmosphere and service is everything that you would want in a family friendly restaurant,  Eating at Arosso is like coming home to a great meal everyday!"
1,The prices have gotten silly. I no longer eat here. $7 tacos is a joke. There is better options in the area that are just as tasty and half the price.
4,"If you are into fresh organic healthy Lebanese food in Tampa area, then look no further! I ordered the kufta lamb kebab, was delicious. My husband ordered the beef shawarma and loved it! The owner was very friendly and she explained to us how important for her to serve healthy grass fed beef. I would be going there again for sure."
2,We order often from this place. They have good food and a great variety but.... if you order take out check EVERYTHING a before you leave. The last two times  we ordered there were missing food items. Attention to details are important. Once you leave their business and find out your order is incomplete then you have to go back for THEIR mistake
4,"Really tasty Chinese! I am a vegetarian and can't always find tasty Chinese due to the sauces having meat or fish; however, they will make a curry sauce that is vegetarian if you request it. It is pretty tasty! Also their veggies are cooked the right amount: not mushy and plentiful. I would recommend checking them out!"
2,"Baggins is a decent sandwich shop in Tucson. Some people consider it a bit pricey. I always get the Baggins Sundown on 12 grain bread, it comes with turkey, lettuce, cranberry, stuffing. It is a very good sanwich and I have tried others and they have been good as well."
1,"The sushi was okay. I've had much better but I've also had a lot worse. The service however was sub-par. The waitress forgot several items throughout the evening; most notably our side of noodles. We had to bring it to her attention and by that time it was too late. To sum it up, sushi was okay and the service was poor. People that think this place is amazing have obviously never had good sushi."
3,"Stopped in for breakfast this morning. Great service. Ordered Mae's omelet and it came with a homemade biscuit and jam. The ham in the omelet was amazing, but the mushrooms did not taste good. The omelet came with grits too. Again, service was great and very friendly."
4,Thai's service excellent. Was a walk-in and service was better than my regular spot.   They include cuticles with their service w/dip manicure.
4,"The milkshakes are good, but the pastry/dessert + ice cream combo menu options are AMAZING. For example, the French toast they serve is better than a French toast you'd get at almost all breakfast spots around Indy.. and that's before you factor in the absolutely home run that is the ice cream on top. And then the bread pudding Ice cream combo is the way bread pudding should always be served. My fiancée and I have been several times, it makes for a great little date outing."
2,"Here is a tip- ask to sit at the Oyster Bar.  It is great fun to watch them grill those things. And the boys there take good care of you.

Yes the grilled oysters are the best thing here.  Otherwise, my gf had an underwhelming shrimp pasta dish.  I had the surf and turf which included a tiny little piece of steak, good for my waistline, bad for my mood.  

They have a great thing with the oysters but the other dishes we had were quite disappointing, especially in a food city.."
3,The best Italian food in Jersey. My wife and I always come for dinner when we visit Shamong.  Always happy. Always satasified.
0,"I ordered a hot coffee. According to the app  there is a free donuts. I asked employee for free donuts. but he told me that, he is unable to give donuts. I asked him it's for my  son And still refused to me. I asked for manager, he said there are no manager working. No good customer service. Employees need to train well how to behaved customer. worst place I ever meet in my life"
3,"Went on an early Sunday eve. Surprised there are still smoking restaurants in town! Bar area is open, light and casual (bloody soccer game on the tv screen!), seating area is dim & romantic /intimate. 

Loved the warm Greek decor. Flaming cheese was great, Greek red wine was fine, ended up getting eggplant parmesan - wow three big thick fresh slices! Most places smother it in mozzarella but this place keeps it simple and lets the flavor come through."
4,"fav breakfast spot for getting the day started on a delicious but healthy note! staff are good people, efficient service too!"
2,"Good came a bit cold.  Bacon and sausages were good. Pancake could have been better, omelets were good
Crispy chicken blt was very good"
1,"Guys come on NOBODY from the management reads the reviews?
You need to get it together!!! It's 2016 in North Wilmington and not a throwback everyday event!!!
Unless you change your prices to half of what you charge now you will never be on my favorite list.
Only plus is your location and the amazing restaurant next to you for which i ll review separate.
Come on and renovate please!!!!"
4,"Big fan for many years. We love the pizza, but my personal favorite is the Risotto Primavera. The salads and gelato are fantastic as well. Service is always friendly and efficient. We love eating in and carry out."
1,"Delicious food, horrible service. It took us 3+ hours for 4 adults ad 4 teens to eat. It took 30 minutes to get our check after we finished dessert and asked for it!  It was almost like our waiter decided we weren't going to tip and forgot us. We were a table with 4 former waiters so we are generally big tippers. We also felt pressure to order extra appetisers and desserts. We won't be back."
4,"Amazing place.. I got to study here
Has apple pay and Android.
There is a wonderful aroma of tea with a hint of rose in the air. 
The food is amazing 
Hospitality is amazing, I was studying and he brought me a sample of tea. Made my day
The Lamb Gyro was sooo good. 
Amazing food"
1,"I came in on Wednesday for the first time to try out pita jungle. I'd heard good things, so I was excited. The service wasn't that great from the beginning. The hostess was smiley and nice but after that it declined. Our waitress was cold and very unfriendly. At this point I was still hopeful to try the food. Unfortunately, I've been sick ever since and can't keep anything down. I ordered a falafel wrap and potatoes as a side. The food was just ok and def not worth being sick over. Will not return."
4,"Quick professional responsive. Wow. If you have a bug problem, call Joe. Was here within an hour and found the source of our moth problem that we could not solve for weeks. He solved it in 15 minutes.  Calmed my wife and fixed the problem.  Cannot ask for more."
4,"i have been going here for years. first rate eye care quality.  if my glasses need an adjustment, they are always ready to help.  i highly recommend Dr. Rehak."
3,"Express  wash self service is quick and efficient. I got a bogo on my express wash and redeemed my 2nd wash today. Pretty good service and a do it yourself vacuum and even towels to boot!  That came in uber handy since I didn't have towels to use. 

Sometimes there is a waiting line and I prefer the express wash so I can zip in and out."
4,"This is my go to Walmart. It doesn't seem to get as many shoppers, probably because it's a neighborhood market, which is why I like it so much. Although it's a neighborhood market, they still sell the essentials like pet food, diapers, toilet paper, laundry soap, etc."
0,Good food. Worst service. Two people came after me got out before me. The food came out later and had to ask the women to please give me my food. It's already waiting for her just to bag it. Although the food was good I'll never go there again because of the bad service.
3,"I like costco but sometimes the lines are long and it seems like they should have more cashiers. It sucks when you just want a couple specific items and you have to wait behind several full carts.
All the staff seem to be friendly. The opticians here are very nice as well"
3,"My heater went out on the coldest day of the year! I called a few different companies to see if someone could come look at it.  While the other companies had voicemail boxes, I was able to speak to Trustco repairman immediately.  He gave me an estimate of when he could come by and the cost for emergency service.  The repairman was at my door hours later and was very efficient in diagnosing the issue and resolving the problem.  As I type this review, I am warm and toasty despite the subzero temperatures outside.  Thanks Trustco!"
4,"This is the second time I go to this FedEx Print Center and their customer service always surpasses my expectations.
Today I went to print some invitations and Rolando helped me. Excellent customer service on his end. He helped me do everything I needed and my invitations came out beautiful. I had no idea what I was doing when I went in there and he definitely made everything happen with a smile on his face. Awesome place and I will continue to come here always."
3,"Pleasantly Suprised.... Wanted a local eatery and live music, I got it and SOME! The Redbeans and Rice are killer, the Boudin is Awesome and this new Elder Flower Drink is something special. The Band made it all worth while! I'll be back...."
4,"These guys did a great job! Tim provided timely service at the. counter, and he was a pleasure to deal with. The car was great, and had some great features. It got great gas mileage too! I would do business with these guys again."
0,"This place has gone downhill since the FedEx people bought it. Two people working with several people in line waiting. Slow. They don't even acknowledge your existence. Forget this place. 
Slow Slow Slow. The copy matching doesn't take my B of A card with the new chip. 

Horrible Service!!!!!!

Does not deserve ONE STAR"
4,"Came in with my buddy Michael G. on a busy Wednesday night. Live music... 50+ people sitting near the bar. Does that faze our server Ashleigh? Of course not. She's a rock star. Providing us great service and always having a smile on her face. We had cold drinks in front of us in about five minutes, followed by hot chimichangas.

Best Mexican in Reno.

We'll definitely be coming back soon."
2,It was alright.  I enjoyed very much the she crab soup.  My daughter really enjoyed her octopus appetizer.  Everything else was just okay.
3,"I've always had good service every time I've gone here. Not quite sure why there are such negative reviews. The place is clean, well-run, and has good service. Some of the staff does not care, but most do, and this always leads to me having a generally fine experience here when I want to be in and out for coffee."
0,"Uverse has gone out 3 times in the last month. Each time I or we as a family have waited over 3 hours for them to show up to fix their service. Right now it is past 1:00. Instead of doing family activities this morning, we waited patiently for them to show up during the given window of 8:30 to 12:30. No weekend brunch, no bike riding, just waiting around for the Uverse guy to show up. 5 hours later, still waiting! Uverse is a completely unreliable service. Can't wait to switch to something else."
4,"Great guys to deal with, and open on Saturday (very convenient!).  They performed the  service required on my Mercedes at half the price of the dealership!  They even turned off the service light (something I'm told most make you take to the dealership to do).  Performed the service in 2 hours, and it runs great now!  I can't recommend them enough!  Found them here on Yelp - the reviews held true!"
4,"Mi Fiesta has the greatest carnitas. No,  seriously... I try carnitas up and down the state of California and nothing compares to the carnitas tacos here.  I started bringing them home to my family after business trips to the area.  Big mistake!  Now,  I can't visit the area without bringing 12 carnitas tacos on the plane.  Order your food at the register and take your ticket to the back kitchen.  My kids put these tacos against the best BBQ places in Kansas City.  They are truly exceptional!"
0,"I will never ever ever come purchase food from this establishment again. I was just SCAMMED. I ordered a turkey burger deluxe, with a side salad and this is what sad meal I got.... FOR 18 DOLLARS. Their menu online said otherwise. I was charged extra for the fries?? That is what the man told me. WHAT DOES DELUXE MEAN? There's certainly nothing deluxe about this sad turkey burger. AVOID this place."
3,"Awesome quesadillas. Love the sauce selection too. This particular location is always good. Service is excellent. They always have a menu in hand, waiting when you walk in the door. Everything always stocked. 

We stop there for lunch from time to time. Never had a problem. Convenient location also."
3,A true treasure in Treasure Valley. Simple and traditional dishes but full of flavor. The chai tea is absolutely devine. It was extremely quiet (no music for ambience) but that was actually quite refreshing for a change. The owner is very pleasant and we will be back soon!
0,"Hard to find worse than this place. They sell junk and accident cars. On top of that they are rude.  The owner is mr. arrogant & obnoxious..
I would never walk in their door again for any reason.."
3,Go to this driving range often. Nothing special. Gets the job done. They have 3 nets to practice short game which are fun and useful. Fairly priced. Never tried mini putt or batting cages.
4,This is the best restaurant we have been to in a very long time. We have visited about 6 times in the last month and have had excellent food and equally excellent service every time. Try it and see for yourself.
0,Worst service ever! When in no one there to seat us so we took a seat. Then no one came over so I went and got menu from entry station. We sat another 10 min and I ask a passing waitress if she could get our waitress she said she would another 5 minutes nothing. So we left will not go back and I strongly advise you not to go either.
0,Garbage customer service- broke down had. Simple warranty question called in 3 times and hung up on by 2 different people 3 times. Ridiculous.
4,Friendly service!  Always happy to see me when I come in.  Food is AMAZING and authentic!  The Greek salad with chicken is my go to.  Always have to have a side of hummus!  So happy to have Opa Opa in West Chester!
0,Good luck with this place. The Domino's app sent our order here since it was the closest to our hotel. App said 40-50 minutes which was okay until an hour and 45 minutes went by and still didn't get our order. Checked the app and it was sitting on checking you order for perfection for over an hour. Called and cancelled. After reading the rest of the reviews I ain't surprised. Stay away
2,"I only came here to pick up some bubble tea.  It seemed to just have been made with a powder mixture (no real fruit in the fruit flavored teas), and the boba was unsweetened and a bit hard. Slightly below average (based on my personal preference), I'd say."
0,Awful.  Upon entering you just know that you are walking into a chain.  Service was friendly but the kitchen sucked.   I'll just give you one example.  My medium steak came out rare on one side and medium well on the other.  The charred side was rare on the inside and the side that did not quite get charred well overcooked.
0,"I hade one of the worst meals I've ever had here. I asked what the best thing on the menu was. They served me a bowl of plain white rice, plain white rice noodles, and then covered in is ketchup mayo . Absolutely disgusting. Completely inedible."
4,"We are so glad we hired Riviera Productions for one hour shooting for our wedding. The price is reasonable, and worth it. Both Jennie and Heather are very nice to work with and the videos are fantastic! The DVD cover is very lovely with our wedding picture on it."
4,"Expensive, but worth it. Emphasis is much more on drink creations, so probably not for the coffee purist. Reminds me of mixologists, but for non-alcoholic drinks. Even the sodas are amazing. Cool atmosphere, as well. Nice place to study as long as you don't need an electrical outlet."
3,"Service: Great
View: Excellent
Food: Pretty good
Drinks: Tasty!

The service was pretty good right off the bat. I ordered the caprese salad which was pretty good. Then I had the peach chicken which came with quinoa and glazed carrots - it was quite good. I had the chocolate cake for dessert (of course) and I also had a martini. The drink was very good! The views were spectacular but you are paying for the views overall. Definitely make reservations and keep in mind they are closed on certain nights for dinner (I think)."
2,"It's your typical local dive bar, dark and Smokey with karaoke....they have a couple of pool tables and dart boards...not much else to say about it."
1,"Hey, how about someone over there answer the phone from time to time?

Happy with standard trash pickup. But try to get a hold of anyone on the phone for bulk pickup (or any other reason).....forget it! It took us leaving them four messages (because they don't pick up the phone) to schedule a bulk pickup. Finally got it scheduled and they never showed up!!!"
1,"It's ok food. The wait isn't to bad but unfortunately, the service fell flat. We felt as if we waited for our server forever! Then once our food was taken it took awhile for our drinks to come. Our food came out about the 40 min mark for 4 adults and 2 small kids. We will try again but hopefully they smooth out the kinks: this review is about two weeks late!"
4,"Hats off to Tiffany! Had horrible issues with my new (less than 5 months old) creepy crawler. Went several times having to have them look at the piece, several visits later Tiffany kept her word and made sure I ended up with a replacement. 
Good employee that goes out of her way to help and make sure the customer is taken care of and remains a repeat customer."
4,"The best Cuban sandwich ever, I don't even like ham or pork on a normal basis but this has converted me. I highly recommend to anyone that wants a warm, crispy and flavorful sandwich, you won't regret it!"
4,"Excellent food and service.  Take note that the actual prices are about $5 higher than Yelp's ""full menu""; but overall a nice, friendly and small restaurant.  I would go back on my next visit to New Orleans."
1,"Overrated. Was told by various people that this place was THE spot for ribs. Got there and the line was out the door. I got 2 pounds of ribs with slaw and cornbread as the sides. Ribs were dry and over cooked. Cornbread was a tasteless pancake. However, Service was very good and drinks were good too. Food did not live up to the hype though. Not that great"
1,"This used to be our favorite place for oysters at the old location. Sooooooo disappointing. Service was horribly slow, our waitress did not come back and check once the oysters came or check to see if we needed another round of drinks. As for the food, while the crab and corn bisque was very good, the portion was minuscule, at least an inch from the top of the cup. The oysters, which used to be freshly shucked, were dry, like we got the ones sitting around. Sadly, I will find a new oyster spot next time I come to NOLA."
4,The only pizza in america that doesn't make me feel sick. These guys are making great food with quality ingredients and low ball prices. Loving it!
3,"I really liked the place. Nice atmosphere and great food.
We took the naan with the different chutneys, the aanda curry, the shrimp &grits and 2 cocktails.

My only comment was that for $12 we had only one naan coming with the chutneys and they charged us $4 for one additional. That's really a bad commercial attitude"
3,"I really like this business plan.  The pizza is one price with what ever combination you would like.  I got a great high meat high veggie pizza and my wife had a vegan friendly whole wheat pie. We were both very happy with the final product.  It is quick, tasty, and inexpensive.  Definitely on my repeat list."
4,Excellent dal tadka and paneer tikka on hot plate sizzling yummy service is ok can be improved ok per indian standards must try tandoori chicken or tandoori paneer tikka one of best places in tampa bay aera for Indian food
4,"I arrived at Hall & Wrye post skin cancer surgery.  They honestly advised me I would be better off not having it stitched up because it would create an even worse scar.   I really appreciated the honesty of the doctor's opinion when he could have just sewn me up and made money on it.  

I have purchased a lot of physician-grade skincare here as well.  It is top notch stuff where you actually see a transformational difference in your skin."
2,"We went for brunch one day and decided to share the Manhattan. They charged us a sharing fee but brought it in one plate, at that point what are you charging us for? At least split the portions in two plates"
3,"Great Dive Bar, good food, and cool bartenders, although its got a Big Buck Hunter HD Video Game and that's all that really matters!"
2,My husband and I went here for dinner over the weekend. The bar area was pleasant to wait for our table in and the ambiance was elegant and not too loud. The food was good but not as good as it should have been for the price. We sat in a room that had candles on small shelves all over the wall and let me tell you it has not been dusted or cleaned in far too long. For such a fancy restaurant you'd think someone would wipe away the dust bunnies. I would suggest going here during Devour Downtown when things are basically half price.
4,This is BY FAR the BEST Chinese food I've ever had in my life! The customer service is excellent. The promptness is so fast. The freshness of the food and the flavor is truly unlike any other! Try it! You won't regret it!
3,We had the strawberry/pineapple and the Butterfinger gelato and they were very good.  Great location with outdoor seating. Got to try a couple other flavors and some were better than others. Prices are quite high.
4,"This is another east side gem that is just delicious, it's just off of 465 on the Washington street exit. It's very clean and the wait staff is very energetic and friendly! I don't think I've been to a more friendly breakfast place. Menu has a good variety of lunch dinner and breakfast items. All are reasonably priced, I had a delicious southwest skillet that was cooked to perfection. I'll be back so I can try all the breakfast dishes"
4,"Easily the best Chinese food I've ever had. I've had half the menu and it has all been amazing, the hot crisp fish, Chengdu spicy chicken, and mala tofu are particularly delicious. The atmosphere is wonderful and the staff are awesome, I had someone help me the first time I've been here but the staff will help you find something you will enjoy."
4,"The pizza is ALWAYS good! The last time we dined at Dewey's, we had our 19-month old daughter and the Manager was so kind to her and took very good care of us making the experience a lot of fun!"
4,"Eddie and Jessie have helped me out twice so far and I will certainly continue to use them whenever needed.  Reasonable prices, quick response, and generally very easy to work with.  I believe that they are more concerned about building long-term relationships than nailing you for unnecessary repairs."
1,"Very small portions. After spending $60 for dinner, I'm still hungry. Food was good but nothing outstanding. I was disappointed."
0,"Absolutely the worst restoration company I have encountered. The workers lied to me about what they were doing and never called ahead when coming to do the work. In addition they took days off in the middle of the week leaving me without a place to go while the home was being worked on. I am absolutely disgusted by this company and the animosity they have caused in my life. Stay away from this company at all costs, it's not worth it and being lied to straight faced makes me worry significantly about what they are doing in my home."
4,I have dined here twice recently. Each time the food was excellent. Excelent service and the deserts are to die for! Definetly the best Indian food in South Jersey.
4,This was our second time on this Segway tour - it was great!  Riley was a great guide and took time to show us all the sights of Clearwater.  It was a highlight of our vacation.  We will definitely return!
3,"Shey was a great waitress! Gator Burger was delicious, and atmosphere was one of a kind! 
Overall great experiance."
3,I'm not going to lie. My expectations were low for what I thought was a takeout place. The pad thai was one of the best I've had in the area and the portion size was huge! I got 2 meals out of the regular dinner plate. They were efficient and the staff was very nice when I came to pick up my food. I'll have to come back to dine in soon.
4,"LOVE IT!! seeing how my daughter is on a GFCF diet it is one of the ONLY places I can take her out to eat at.Not only is everyone super friendly,they even gave us the recipe for their ranch dressing!!! THANK YOU!!! WONDERFUL FOOD!!"
0,"I brought my car in at 1pm in Wed after an accident. I live in LA. Steve said he could get the part in the next day. The ordered the wrong part, promised that it would be complete Thursday. Well on Thursday they promised Friday at 545. I boarded an Amtrak train at 330to pick up the car and at 4pm they call and say my car is not ready. This is the worst communication ever. Do Not Go To this store."
3,"Enjoyed my dinner here. I had a gyro sandwich with garlic feta fries. I thought the gyro was good, but prefer thinner slices of meat to the chunks they used. I also got the knafa which was pretty good but could have used a sauce of some sort. I would eat here again."
3,"food was really good  we had the philly cheese steak and the chicken gyro platter, fries were really good. I would def call ahead it does take a little while. It was kinda pricey"
4,Just had lunch there. It was really good. Order the fresh guacamole.  Very yumny. Bartender made awesome margaritas. .Kaylyn my server so nice and customer oriented. Manager came around too. Great experience. ..Be back soon.
1,"Worst Taco pizza of my life! I recently stumble upon my love for taco pizza and thought I'd try it at my local pinas, where I've been a loyal customer for years. I've been a proud no slice left behind girl all my life. And when trash day came that title was thrown out with it. I've never had a bad experience with them til this. But it's kinda like having the perfect boyfriend and then finding out he likes pepsi over coke. Goodbye pepsi loving boyfriend and goodbye Pina's!"
3,Great Chinese food.  Fabulous calamari.  All the dishes are very good.  Best Chinese restaurant I have been to.
4,Large beer selection last time we stopped in. Plenty of flavor/style variety. Will definitely be back when to the area again.
3,"A pleasant place with nice booths.  I had a Reuben which was good, and the sides were tasty."
3,"I quite appreciate Pennington's as I'm working to lose the last of my baby weight...

What I like is that the items are cut to fit a larger busted woman.  Where as a 14/16 at Reitman's might fit too snug across my chest, a x or 1x here has ample room.  

I don't care for the workout clothing line here and find that they are lacking in some departments but I most definitely appreciate their professional dress clothing and jackets.  

Also, sign up for emails and get a discount on your birthday as well as emails about secret sales :-)"
2,"Unimpressed...we might try it again, but highly unlikely. We had friends visiting from Orlando and one of our ""things to do"" together is to try new food joints. I was a little embarrassed, and not at the surroundings, but by the quality."
0,"I only go to this Marshall's because it is close to my house. Customer service is okay. Today I was purchasing some items, close to $100. Tried to pay with cash, $100 dollar bill. She couldn't take it because they ""couldn't find the line"". Only 1 girl looked at it and then asked for another form of payment. I went out to my car and there was in-fact a line. 
I worked for TJX companies for close to 4 years and we had a pen or asked another associate to verify. So unprofessional"
3,"This is my favorite Starbucks in all of Tucson. I come here daily and even go out of my way so I know I will get my drink made perfectly. After 4 years of coming here I have had only one negative experience.   Sure, I could go to circle k for a cheap cup of coffee but the atmosphere here is what keeps me coming back for the classic green straw."
3,"We were on the hunt for pajamas...we were late! When we asked if there were more pajamas besides the ones located in the front, the associate was baffled, lol. It was like he didn't understand and answered at the same time. Sent us to some baby clothes. Hmmm. Ok. Must've been the new guy! Anyway, my wife found a few items she liked and even though it was packed, the lines moved pretty fast. Let's chalk up the chaos and confusion to last minute holiday shopping."
1,"I don't know what measure the other reviews used for comparison but I have had better many, many times. Glazed were no better than those produced at my local grocery store deli and specialty donuts were a little better but Kristina Kreme puts them to shame! For a gourmet donut the really need to step up their game."
3,"Key words: (1) CASH-only, (2) steamed bread--just sweet enough and spongy, (3) red bean sesame balls (I don't exactly know what to call it), (4) they also sell duck meat. 

This is a great place if you want authentic Chinese bakery items. It also has duck meat (Peking style I think?) that you can buy. My personal favorites are red bean balls and egg tarts. They are affordable, and just sweet enough."
2,"Really liked the ambience . It was a quite sunday nite wid few tables for dinning and few for lounge. Ordered cajun chicken breast with green salad n coleslaw. Breast was very juicy , soft n well marinated with flavours . I dint know if it was the cajun spice or vinegar or wat but the dish was toooooooo salty. I enjoyed it otherwise as i cleaned the cajun spices on top.
 My partner got some rice bowl which was equally yummy but too much oily..."
3,Getting a dipped cone and pretzel bites!  Need to fix the parking lot as we have to watch out for pot holes!
3,"I always come back for the beer variety and the crack fries.  I cant tell you what my favorite beer is as the selection is always changing (i think monthly). But no matter what I have, I have yet yo be disappointed.  Be sure to ask for samples"
3,It's confusing to me another reviewer liked everything they tried except the garlic knots. I am actually going to recommend them.
4,Went there yesterday for the first time. Wow!!! Great food and nice staff. Greet you with a smile offer to help you with what you want. They use quality food and prepare it really well. Cookies at four in afternoon just backed. Bread fresh. I will go there again as soon as possible. Wish we had one in SLO.
4,I freaking love their smokeshack double burger. I add hot sauce too though for spice. Their cheese fries are wonderful too. They have doggie treats too.  I'd recommend this place to everyone if they want a quick fix.
4,"Great ambiance, friendly staff and delicious mead. If you've never had mead or just want to have a classy night out this place is perfect."
4,"As a local I know the ends and outs to good eating.  This place has been a favorite of mine for some time now.  The staff is fantastic, knowledgeable, caring and considerate.  The kitchen staff put together some of the best specials available.  It's not you're everyday fried everything.  Treat yourself to a glass of Chardonnay, as I do on each visit, and let them do the rest.  AMAZING!!!!"
0,"Been waiting over an hour for a drug test. I'm about to pee my pants and they just keep saying that someone will help me shortly 

This is pretty ridiculous. Especially since they aren't offering water in the facility. So I came in here ready to pee."
4,Deliciousness and love the style and vibe being Louisiana or Florida keys like! Fun and festive and all around awesome
0,Overpriced and have a horrible selection of sizes and apparel. Zero hooded sweatshirts!!!!! It's Indiana you should always have hooded sweatshirts.
4,"Ok, do your self a favor and call up Old Towne and get their meat lovers pizza.  It is OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!!!

They have awesome cheesesteaks too.  Make sure to take advantage of their specials, 3 cheesesteaks for 15 bucks, plust 10% off online. 

Amazing food, amazing service, did I mention amazing food? 

Pizza Lovers is AMAZING!!! They have gyro meat on it, you won't find that anywhere else!!!  SOOOOO GOOOOODDD!!!!"
4,"We switched to UpRooted over a year ago after having issues with a another company and it has been the best decision we ever made in regards to our yard. Artie is friendly, knowledgeable and really cares about what she does. She takes her time and does a thorough job every time. Highly recommend!"
4,"There is not a negative thing to say about this ""chain"" of restaurants.  Joe Vuskovich, the owner, makes the best cajun in Indy.  He also gives a damn about his customers.  I'm glad that Yats is now an Indianapolis tradition (at least in this man's opinion)"
3,"I really liked this place and I enjoyed the atmosphere more than the other Mexican food chains. They have a bar! Also, I Love the salsa bar. Service is quick and is relatively inexpensive. I got the shrimp fajita platter and it was delicious and filling."
4,"Great tacos, good customer service. The fish tacos were very well made and the sauce they provide was a good compliment. They even offered to bring food out to our car so we didn't have to wait in the cold or keep coming out. Will def be back !"
0,Ordered pizza for delivery and it was a little tiny mimi pizza for $28.00. Last time we order from this place. Oh and it was cold.
3,"Go for lunch, but not at noon wait until one then you have all the time and space you want. The salads are great. I really enjoyed the shrimp and avocado. The peanut dressing and the crisp wonton noodles are awesome. Gumbo is quite good as well. Solid lunch spot, just go later to miss the crowd."
3,"The ""IT"" place! Must go!
They have it all from an area that is quiet and classy, plenty of closed off banquet rooms for weddings or parties, a casual classy bar, a loud swinging dance floor, classy dining area, to an outside music arena with a beer garden and picnic tables! This place literally has a little something for everyone! The food is always good, the atmosphere is always fun, and the beer garden is really something special. This is a must go place!"
4,"One of the best pizza places in the area. I love putting toppings on my pizza, but I can't help but get just a plain cheese. It's so simple yet so perfect. The large pizza is huge, but I can literally eat a large cheese pizza all by myself because I just can't stop eating it.  It's so good!"
2,The garden patio is very pleasant and is dog-friendly.   The food is good and of course there's a gaming room.
4,"Came here for lunch with a friend, I love poke bowls so even though this place was a little out of the way I wanted to try it. I have to say I was very happy with my meal! The portions are huge and I love how you are able to customize your bowl or choose from one of their predetermined options. I opted for the avocado bowl and was not disappointed! They also have some interesting drinks that I would like to try on my next visit."
4,"I followed my stylist Ashleigh over from Salon Bamboo when she made the switch to 19 Blue, and am really pleased with the place. Nice setting, friendly people, and very quality work. Highly recommended. And for any other guys out there looking at it, they do a great job with guys' hair."
2,"Never mind the ambiance! Enjoy the duck. But I must say, the food was over-the-top greasy - even the vegetables. And were the complimentary ice cream and fortune cookies worth the trip here..?"
4,We took a ride to New Hope to taste a little freedom and wound up eating in Jersey instead. Followed the yelp reviews to this little bistro and we loved it. We will be back.
4,Literally the best Japanese izyka in Edmonton. Heated toilet seats are the STAR and the simmered pork belly is the BEST.
0,"Should have checked these first....NO SURPRISE IT HAS ONE STAR.

The dealership is new and fancy....thats the end of the good.

I am TERRIBLY REGRETFUL that i decided to pay the premium to take my Cayenne GTS to a Porsche dealer.  

If you want the details, msg me....  otherwise DONT USE THESE GUYS.  

I will NEVER use them again."
4,"super fun! you should def bake your children there. it's fun and if they are scared of animals it'll be fun still cause it's a lot of stuff to do. camel rides, face paint, brinks, food. it's overall amazing must go!"
4,"We went back again on next trip down to Philly, two weeks later. I honestly wasn't expecting it to as good the second time...but it was! This place really is incredible..."
4,"A legitimate SB bar for twenty-somethings. Keep up the live music, and try for chill house during the weekend nights. Start promoting events through facebook more too."
1,Everything was great minus the wedge of hard plastic that entered our avocado tuna dish... only took the tuna off the bill. A better monetary response would have prevented me from posting this.
4,"[solidcore] has been a great place for me to get back I to working out.  The trainers push you to do your best each time, and I love it when I am walking around sore for 2-3 days after a workout!  Additionally they run monthly specials to keep things fun and they even have cute workout gear.  If you haven't tried it yet and you are looking for something new, give it a try!"
1,"I just wanna agree with Johnny D. Seriously, guys. I'm not a psycho-ass crazy vegetarian. I do not need you to get out the bleach or buy a whole new machine just for slicing cheese. Just wipe the damn thing off every once in a while.

Also: my sub was about 90% cheese and 10% tough bun. Wawa does better."
3,"Scouts was perfect. Everything was really good. Fish and chips-burgers-super cold draft- really good wait staff. - in Westhaven. Or West Heaven.
You will not be dissatisfied ."
0,"It's probably very authentic but unfortunately we didn't like it. Maybe the dishes we got were the odd ones out but the bread was cold, the fish wasn't seasoned in any way, and the lamb was tough, fatty and cold."
0,"I understand you are defying Gov. Wolf's indoor dining suspension order. That's a shame. I did love your food as noted in my first review, but in good conscience I can't return as a customer due to your actions. I wish you well, but I wish the greater community well to a greater extent and can't support actions that will encourage community spread of the virus and potentially kill people."
4,"Very high end excellent experience. I had the Maryland crab cakes which were excellent. I also had a great spinach salad and an excellent salmon dish. I enjoyed the experience. The Waite staff was very friendly. Overall a great experience. Only downside, was it is pricey."
3,"I still love this bar but found an arm hair in my burger last time. The burger, however, besides the arm hair, was pretty good. OK bar food."
4,Best spray tan ever! Carol and her staff are awesome. Spray tan always comes out even and beautiful.  Definitely make this your go-to tanning salon!
4,"Finally!  A great quality sub and cheese steak shop that uses fresh, local ingredients,  fresh sliced meats,  and rolls baked in house!  American Subject with ham, provolone and red vinegar and oil was superb!  My chicken cheese steaks with onions on fresh whole wheat roll was the best I've ever had.   A keeper!"
4,"One of the best pho places in town! Keep this place local. The owners are friendly and they remember repeat customers. May not be in the best area, but the food is quality and fresh. I'm moving soon and I will miss getting take out and dining in! I always recommend this place to Vietnamese food lovers."
4,Greatest perogis ive ever tasted and the bartender is great at mixing drinks the whole place is cleanly even my plate
4,"i Love The Body Serene!   I don't go as often as I would like to, but each time I go it's so relaxing and the staff is always friendly and welcoming.  Jill is at the front desk and always helpful and ready with a smile.  Today I had a facial and manicure -my favorite services to get there - and Chantal was amazing. She's the best!  Thank you for a great morning!"
4,"Came fast, cut my Key and programmed it successfully. Would use again, when I'm in town. Noam was nice and a pleasure to work with."
1,"Summer House was interesting, but my experience with the help was anything but friendly.  A tall blond not only showed up late to open the front door, but she was exceptionally rude.  I left without spending my cash, and I am sure the vendors would not appreciate her rudeness toward a client or her work ethic of arriving late while a customer waits for her to open the store."
4,"Brand new place in Campus Town at TCNJ. This place is going to make a mint, because of their really good food, and because of the location at TCNJ. Millennials love Mexican food, and this place has excellent nacho's, adobo pork aka Al Pastor, burrito's and taco's. We thoroughly enjoyed the food, very nice employees and the location is spot on. Good Luck, not that you will need it!"
4,"This is my go-to for all baby and toddler gifts. Renee is so helpful in picking the perfect toy or gift for each age. She is also very knowledgeable on all of benefits and learning aids associated with every product. I've recently moved out of state, and I still call and order presents. Love this shop!"
3,I had the High Baggin's and pasta salad. The High Baggin's was delicious but it could have used an extra strip of bacon. The pasta salad was fine but not good enough to get me to pay $2 for that small portion again. They were very fast considering how busy they were. I'll be back.
2,Good sushi that's priced ok.  This is not the best sushi I have ever had but it is a solid good place to go.  I will definitely return.  The staff was very nice and attentive and it was quick and child friendly.
3,Very nice place for drinks or dinner. Staff is great and the menu is very fresh. In a great location too for site seeing.
4,"Great food! I love the atmosphere of the restaurant, feels like you're at the beach! Wide variety of food and byob if you'd like! highly recommend"
4,"Great place to shop for hats.  I will definitely be back the next time I visit NOLA.  They have a wide selection of Kangol, which are high-quality, attractive hats. I ended up with a Scala sun hat that I'm very happy with.  The employees were polite and helpful. Great shopping stop! Fun to look at the wall of famous patrons."
0,"I was very disappointed. Food was cold when we (finally) were served. It took close to 40 minutes for 2 breakfast plates. Even the coffee wasn't very good. 
For the prices they charge, I feel like we were ripped off. I honestly cannot understand why the place is always so busy."
4,"Very authentic place with nice people. Food is tasty, just like at home. :) Menu is pretty rich for the small place, they got a variety of sandwiches, hoagies, burgers and salads. Perfect for lunch. Was pretty comfortable and neat overall. 
PS. Putting Joel Embiid with AI is just wrong (see photo)."
4,"Jose always comes through with my fresh cut!! Been going here for a while now. Highly recommend this spot, just make sure you make an appointment before going."
4,"I love this place! You have to try the hoagie dip I don't know why no one has thought of this before! So far I've tried the garlic bread cheese steak which has ruined me for just about all other cheesesteaks! The owner told me that their secret is using fresh meat not frozen. The meatball sandwich was also great, you can definitely tell they're homemade and I've tried a few other sandwiches. I'm just working my way down the list. The place is always clean. And the staff is very friendly and helpful."
2,"Fried pickles were great, however, the nachos were terrible! Mushy beans and the BBQ sauce was gross!!!! I would come back for the fried pickles but that's about it."
3,This place has never disappointed! Everything is so fresh and food pairings are amazing.  Everything from scratch!  Extra tables set outside to accommodate those not comfortable sitting inside during this time.
4,Great food. I recently had them do catering for a family party and it was  really really amazing. Great service. Everyone was thrilled. Big Thumbs up.
4,"We had enchiladas, and they were delicious! I'm not new to Mexican food since I'm from San Antonio, and this place gives me the taste of back home. Highly recommended!"
4,"Imagine if your hipster, vegan, antique-obsessed stylish best friend invited you to stay in his guesthouse. That's what this place feels like! Great decor, friendly manager, cold-brew iced coffee and organic snacks ready in your room. Lots of character. Never staying in a motel 6 or days in again."
2,"Had lunch here today with a friend who had to have mexican food. Nothing really special about this place other than in the parking lot a huge painted sign saying that ""The parking lot floods""  Meaning what.........?  

Anyways I had ordered a beans, cheese and rice burrito all I can say that was good about this place was the beans!  SOOOO GOOD!"
4,"Perfect...the service was fast food was delicious. We ate here last year and was very pleased and this year was just as good. I just wished they didn't take the lobster ravioli off the menu. 
Update- came back for the second night. It doesn't get any better than this."
0,No.. just no. It's just all pre frozen food you could probably get at Costco. The beer was no good either.
3,"I've eaten here many times out of convenience. Their bruschetta with mozzarella and balsamic vinaigrette is delicious. I've had the regular pizza and chicken Alfredo pizza, both are killer! Truth be told never eaten at the restaurant but they do give you free bread if you ask for it in your to go orders."
4,"This place is so good. The grill cheese and basil tomato bisque is amazing. I actually ate it with an upset stomach, and it settled it down. If you're on the fence for trying this place, I can't recommend it enough. Also, the customer service is fantastic. The owner was involved, but not over bearing. You can feel the workers care for the business. The effort can be seen in the clean appearance of the tables and the serving area. I can't wait to come back and support this local business."
3,"probably one of the best authentic Mexican you will ever find in Florida

carne asada is great 

carnitas awesome

and barbcoa delicious

enjoy"
2,"Boring... which seems mean. But I just wasn't too impressed. The outside is pretty - but you can skip the tour. If you decide to ignore my advice and shuffle through this place, look for the pictures towards the end with famous people who came to the mission like bikers and Babe Ruth - that part was intriguing."
4,"We've been longtime customers at Sapporo for a reason. Fast, friendly service and good food. The sushi here is always prepared fresh and skillfully. There's a good variety, too. Their menu items are well done. Try the shrimp tempura appetizer as an entree. Lots of shrimp to go with the sushi. It's a good family friendly restaurant and it won't bankrupt you."
3,"values for all the meat, broccoli, and large salad they give you."
4,"We really enjoy this park. It's nice to take pictures and see the ducks. There are several really nice trails. I've seen people walking their dogs, rollerblading, walking/running, and biking on these trails. Very nicely kept. However, the water at the pond where the ducks are is a little gross in spots. Everything is 5 star to me that I've seen so far, apart from the gross spots in the pond."
4,"Best pizza I've ever had! The salad was also excellent. I was in Meridian for the weekend and was so impressed I ate there twice. We had the 2 for lunch special and the portion sizes were perfect. We also ate dinner there and split a pizza and a salad, perfect portion size again. The pizza crust is amazing, none better. I want to try every different kind of pizza on the menu! The ambiance is great.  I'll definitely go back, I'm craving it now!"
3,"Some hits and misses.  Maybe I should have asked them what they were known for.  The Breaded Poachers was a unique twist on poached eggs, but the dish was lacking in salt.  The Piggie Smalls was meh.  Lastly, the Blueberry hotcakes stack:  It really wasn't a stack of anything.  It's not pancakes either.  It's like a literal cake...imagine a cornbread square that tastes sort of like a pancake with blueberries in it."
3,"Very tasty! But $15 for a chicken salad is a bit much. I enjoyed it. Shirazi is great! Shoor is pickled veggies, and is good.

The pita is great. The chicken was very tender and fresh."
4,"Incredible flavors,  great roasts, good selection of beans with several brewing styles. 
Good pastry selection. 
Great prices."
3,"The menu is short. They offer salads with different choices to add, such as chicken, salmon, steak, crab cake, tuna ahi salad. Five different wing flavors. The parm fries are great as well as the soft pretzel sticks that comes with cheese dip, also try the crab fondue and nachos with chicken is Excellent!!!"
4,"This place is the absolute best. Zari is my waxer and always gets me in and out and does the best job, super thorough. They have the best products and can always squeeze me in for last minute schedule changes. Fantastic customer service. Def loyal customer."
2,"Clean salon, but service is more on the minimal side.  Other salons nearby give back massage with all manicures and pedicures.  Leg massage during pedicure is very brief, so it is not quite as relaxing as other places; however, they do decent work, and it is a clean, comfortable place to get in and out fairly quickly.  I will go back."
4,"Dairy Cottage recently catered our event with 25 guests in our home.  They were incredibly easy to work with, the price was extremely reasonable, and best of all the food was fantastic!  We had full and happy guests!  THANK YOU!!"
0,"Placed an online order then when I go to pick up they say that they are no longer doing the b1g1 deal on flower without advertising it at all, with that I don't ever plan on returning"
3,"Food is good, parking is horrible. 
Canes delivers quality chicken fingers that are always a treat, but the parking at this location makes the whole experience a living nightmare. Cluster cluck is what a chicken would say, and he would not be wrong (if it is a boy chicken). When they didn't make a drive-through that was one thing, but the inhuman lack of parking is another. Hopefully the restaurant buys the lot next-door to accommodate some of the parking woes."
4,"Amazing service and amazing food the breakfast is amazing and comes out fast,and prizing is perfect."
0,"First time in Reno, and we found good reviews here to stay... there are better hotels to stay at in downtown.  This hotel is far from all the other hotels and the closest hotel is the Peppermill.  I would suggest to stay at the Silver Legacy, that is where we stayed the 2nd night."
4,"I live in Chicago, and tried to move to Tucson partially just to eat here more often. It is that good!!!"
3,"Medical oddities, yes please.  Great collection of macabre bodies/body parts. The museum itself is on the smaller side but it's packed full of unique items."
0,"Pretentious and arrogant is the theme of this store. In my first, only and last experience with this liquor store that is the attitude and approach I experienced when trying to source several hundred dollars of wine for a catered in home dinner. Appeared the owners Laura and Ames were going to be very helpful initially but once they were asked a clarifying question about a price on a couple wines they became adversarial and surprisingly rude. You can get wine, liquor and beer lots of places, go where customer service and value still matter to the shopkeeper is my suggestion."
4,"Honestly, it's bomb. Been in a handful of times and haven't been disappointed, and I'm very picky."
3,This is a Super Target so they have everything under the sun you could possibly want. It's a very clean store and always has stock of what you're looking for. Plenty of parking and lighting both inside and out.
1,"Ordered shuttle for 8:10 AM. Called at 8:21 and they stated that the driver was ""right there"" - bus finally showed up at 8:30.

That said, this is your stereotypical shared ride service. Expect to be riding around for up to an hour before you get dropped off.

That - and make sure to do the math; this service really only makes sense if you're riding solo."
4,"Excellent service, excellent location, excellent food. Not more than half a mile walk from the Clear Water Pier. I went and got food around 2:00 on a Sunday afternoon. There was only a short wait time and plenty of seating to choose from. There was a gentlemen working at the front counter who answered all my questions. I got the GBLT. Never have a had a BLT (with guac) that GOOD. These guys know what they're doing. A definite must if you're in the clear water area."
4,"Good food and great service! One of my favorite dog friendly places! The early riser burger is delicious, I highly recommend it."
4,I'll come back to New Orleans just for the PORK BELLY sandwich...#drools
4,Service and staff were nothing short of fantastic. Food was out standing. My 1st turn on to them from Angela and their family has been going here for years. Very good and will be coming back 10-Fold!
4,"The little driving course with a fake village and stoplights is so cool for the kids!  

They also have pavilions for picnics that provided shade, multiple climbing structures, a sprinkler and a pond nearby with water fountain.   

There were also volleyball, basketball, tennis courts for older kids and adults.  

Says there's even a fitness trail with 18 stations (.72 miles).

Just remember to bring a kids ""car"" from home to bring to drive around the mini town!"
4,"Reluctantly strayed from my favorite ice cream shop to go here. So glad I did! Best ice cream I've had! Son had banana split..you can choose each flavor...wife had toasted coconut w/ chocolate, daughter had cookie dough, and I had rum raisin. We were all full and happy! They give big portions and the price as well as the taste is right!"
4,"Fantastic open air theater, with great preformances.   The most memorable for me will always be ""Meet Me in St. Louis"" & ""The King & I"".    There is nothing more amazing than being out in the open, waiting for nature to dim the lights, and when you see the stars the show begins.  
Not that expensive for close seats, but the best spur of the moment thing is to get there early and wait in line for the free seats!"
0,"Well.... that went down quick, we went in on a non-busy time (7:30 pm) and it took longer than usual.

The kids working that shift, were so out of it. You could tell it's the ones who don't need to work, they are made by their parents. 

Anyways. The food was terrible, so bad that I won't be returning for a very long time, if not ever. It was just atrocious."
2,Nice to be along the water and have the view. Every is very relaxed here and service can be slow but it works. It comes down to food. Portions aren't that big here and I didn't like food much. I tried the crappy cakes and they didn't have a very refreshing taste. The volcano shrimp appetizer. It came in a martini glass and and they just didn't hit the spot with Sauses.
4,"Shop is great, the owner is extremely knowledgeable. He showed me how to remove/attach the bearings from the wheel, and how to clean the bearings. He was very nice and you can tell he enjoys doing what he does and teaching others how to do it as well. Obviously, things are a little pricey, but I mea what do you expect when coming to a boardshop? Would definitely recommend and will definitely come again"
4,Normally you go to a psychic when you feel like things in life are horribly. But what rose did for me was help me realize all the great things about life that I wasn't seeing because I was too busy focusing on the negative. She is amazing! It was one of the best readings I've had in a long time . I highly recommend rose
0,"I would give this place a 0 star because our waitlist/ ""manager"" ask my 10 year old kids for an I.D and he was very rude."
0,I should've read the previous reviews more closely. Cut cuticles on hand and feet so close they bled. Paraffin wax not cleaned off completely. At $83 one of the more expensive mani/pedis I've had yet one of the worst. Tried this place because it was closer to home. Won't be going back.
1,"Ordered a mushroom and Swiss with traditional fries through Door Dash delivery. Burger was undercooked (ordered medium but it was medium rare - see pic) so I had to microwave it. Fries were cool and some were cold. For the price, I felt they skimped on the amount of fries - see pic, and there were like 4 mushrooms on the burger. Overall quality of food prep and ingredients was poor and the burger flavor was just meh. Not sure if I'd give Scotty's another chance either in person or delivered."
4,"I visited this awesome coffee shop for the first time last week and was absolutely delighted. Customer service was right on point and so welcoming. I had a lot of questions that they happily answered.

I ordered an iced hazelnut latte and A coffee cake muffin. Both were delicious but I have to say that a coffee cake muffin is a must try!

I was also able to buy a bag of coffee which I made this morning and I am extremely happy about it. I got the Uganda single origin.

Overall great place to visit! I will definitely check it out again when I'm back in Indiana!"
3,They need to serve lemon with the food! Got the crab cakes. There was a bit of an odd taste like the fryer needed to be cleaned. They were good but wish I had lemon for them.
0,"Food isn't great, and expensive. They charged us for a kids water, in a to go cup, but not my big water? Good service though, nice waitress."
4,"We were in Nashville for a day and craved Indian food.  Well, not only there is an Indian restaurant in Nashville, it is a fantastic one.  The menu is huge, and among other things they do feature an Achari curry - one of my favorites and a rare find.  It was delicious, as well as rogan josh.  Portion size was very generous.  Garlic naan was one of the best I've tried, even though they should really cut it in pieces.

The interior design looks very elegant and upscale, and the place is very clean and nice."
4,"Flemings went above and beyond the expectation of a fine dining steakhouse. The food was outstanding, the service was impeccable and the lava cake was to die for! It was my boyfriends 30th birthday and it was a night to remember forever. Thanks again and we will be back soon!"
2,"Came here Tuesday; nice little spot inside that's clean and everything looks me to the walls, the floor, tables, bathroom etc. I ordered the fried fish platter which was honestly kind of basic. The fish didn't have much taste like at all. The fries were okay but were drowned in seasoning salt. Just a little disappointed that the fish wasn't up to par from what you expect from a New Orleans restaurant :( good service though!"
4,Went to Weber Grill for my friend's birthday and each person ate something different. We all loved our food and our waiter was the best! I highly recommend asking for Shedrick to be your waiter!
3,This one of my favorite places!  Great healthy options and if you feel like cheating a bit you can add some queso!  The only downfall is the steep upcharge for guacamole($2.05)  If that doesn't bother you then this is the spot!
4,Another great meal   Always love coming here. Perfect halfway point or meeting spot in between LA and the Central Coast. Great service and superb food. Will be back again next trip. Thanks guys
3,"My husband and I have eaten at the Hogpit a few times and we've never had a bad meal.  The ambience is casual and cozy and the prices are reasonable.  The owners and staff are very friendly and helpful.   My husband's favorite is the sausage and my favorite is the brisket sandwich.  Both are pretty amazing!  They also have the most interesting men's room I've ever seen, lol.  My friends made a point of dragging me in there to see it."
4,Absolutely phenomenal!! If I could rate 100 stars I would!! Excellent food and service! Extension to my kitchen.
3,"Came here based on reviews, great place. The guy took his time and really provided great service. Highly recommend people coming here. Will be returning."
3,"We were there Saturday early evening on 1/18/2014 and I thought it was very good and I would definitely go back.

Pros:
- parking is very easy/accessible
- got the burger with fried egg and it was very filling, loved the fried egg, sweet potato fries were good
- beer selection and prices were good, about $18 PP total for dinner
- LOCATION/AREA seems very safe
- cheesesteak egg roll appetizer were very good

Cons:
- bathrooms were unique, but clean and they worked so no real complaints"
2,"While the food was good, the staff had no idea what was going on. It seemed like it was complete chaos in the kitchen. Several times we where brought items we didn't order, and the portion sizes were small."
4,The service is very fast and everything I have tried is delicious! My favorite is the drunken yardbird taco!
0,Owner very friendly but he doesn't like you using your own cleaning kit! You will end up spending 7-8$... close enough to other automatic auto wash.
4,"Wow.  I got the small plate, the carpaccio, as a meal.  It was probably the best item I have tasted in a year.  I live an hour away, and I'm excited to make the trip again just to try other phenomenal dishes like that one."
0,3 small brisket sandwiches and 2 small cole slaws for 40 bucks.  Was just ok.  Never again.
4,"Very good job, didn't push products or fixing what wasn't broken.

Chris, one of the techs, was super nice and conversational.  

All of these locations' costs are pretty much in line with each other, so it kind of comes down to service.  I'd definitely recommend these guys."
4,"One of the coolest places in St Pete to grab a drink. The views of the bay are awesome. It does a good job at weeding out the rowdier crowds typically on central and the price point keeps many college kids away. Night time brings an awesome atmosphere which is usually packed with well dressed clientele. Not a board shorts and tank kind of place, button down and blazer."
2,"5/30:  an update...once again the receipt printed without the logo at the top. This time, the cashier attempted to help by reprinting the receipt, unfortunately, she was not successful. The cashier was apologetic, and I greatly appreciate her attempting to assist. I am loyal to Dierbergs, and I completely understand technology fails, however, one would think this could be addressed since it has happened on multiple occasions. Dierbergs has a reputation for being a higher end grocer, printing a logo on their receipt should be within their capabilities."
4,"We love the banana splits, made with REAL strawberry ice cream, complete with chunks of frozen strawberries."
4,"The bartender at this bar, I believe her name is Michaela is the best bartender I have been waited on thus far. I have been in town for numerous years and she never lets me feel like I am in a desert. She keeps her patrons well hydrated at all times! I suggest to anyone to come see her while she's working. You won't be disappointed!"
4,"Favorite spot in St. Pete, hands down.  The vibe, the atmosphere and the food are tops in the city.  And everyone working is cool as hell!  A must stop when in town."
0,The service here is horrible. Their system for making drinks is completely disorganized and causes orders to be completely ignored. My order took fifteen minutes to be completed.
4,"One of my favorite restaurants in the city! I have been going here for years and everything is outstanding. You just walk in, order at the counter and have a seat. Service is quick and easy.

Some of my favorites are the:
Le Pig Mac
Pimento Cheese Sliders
Mac-n-cheese-some of the best I've had and I'm not big into mac-n-cheese usually! Love the bread crumbs on top
Hot Boudin"
4,The food was delicious and so was the sweet tea!! I had the shrimp creole with mustard greens and my husband had the crawfish etouffee with jambalaya.
4,"Love how they do my nails and toes. They've got me hooked on dipping, my nails stay strong and grow out fast when dipped. It's like a screen protector for my nails. I have yet to find a place that has competitive rates and fantastic service. If you don't call ahead you may have to wait though, this place is often busy even on a Friday morning. My dipped nails last about 6weeks and my toes (gel) usually last 4-5weeks at peek condition."
4,We found this gem while visiting Nashville for a conference.  The service and the food is great.  They have a diverse menu and everything we ate was great.  They have a few gluten free options and the raw oysters are delicious.  I recommend the Shrimp and grits and the jambalaya.  The grilled salmon was perfect.  We will return next time we are in Nashville!
3,I love this place the owner she was so kind and great take care. Also their buffet was so great. I love their BBQ squid. But everytime when we go there after we done we gotta go home now bcoz u gonna smell BBQ all over lol but I love their food that's okay for me and my family
0,Go here if you want to get shot 0 stars if possible horrible experience hood rats hanging all around
0,"Unfortunately, Vanguard has grown beyond its capabilities. The reps are not trained properly and they consistently provide conflicting and incorrect information. The end result is that you, the customer, must do things over and over again-some of them time consuming--in order to get anything done. You can wait two - three weeks for an advisor appointment only to have them come to the phone without the information that they promised to prepare for the call. There must be a better company that handles ETFs in the same way. Once I find it, I will move my investments."
1,"First  We won't do this place again. Service was below average. Only us &  2 bar flies. Waitress/bar keep/hostess was here then there then where did she go. Food was bland , very bland and very expensive. Coke was good. My wife had the Chicken Quesadilla, Just chicken 
and almost nothing else. Terrible. My no taste but hot."
4,"Outside dining with fantastic sandwiches!! Kale salad was not my favorite, but great little place."
4,"Enjoyed lunch here with a friend! The atmosphere feels like Vegas and the service & food were great. Yes, it's a bit pricier but you get higher quality food than other restaurants in the area provide. We split the grilled cheese, turkey club, and fries. All our food was yummy! I plan to go back and take the hubby next time."
4,My first time here-- This place was awesome. Omg the food melted in your mouth. We had eggplant parm/veal parm and split between us. Portions are very big. Everything from thje bread -salad-dinner and sautéed spinach with garlic and olive oil was VERY GOOD!!!!  Service from the moment u walk in is awesome. Our waiter was great and will go out of our way to go here again. Thanx so much for a awesome night!!!!!!
3,"This is my hotpot spot because it's closer to me than Chinatown and easier to find parking. Love the high ceilings and decor. They have lunch specials until 3pm on weekdays and cash 10% off discounts.  I always get the herb rejuvenation soup base with vegetables, mushrooms and fish balls. It's nice that they have vegan and vegetarian options. You can make your own sauce at the sauce bar. The servers work hard. They always check that your drinks are full and ask if you want to order more."
0,"Its so bad.  Smell and funk from the meat.  I don't understand how such little care can be given to food.  This is four steps below Taco Bell, on its best day."
3,"This place is pretty good - the barista knows their stuff and they go the extra mile for their customers. I ordered an earl grey latte, which wasn't even on their menu, but they made it without a second of hesitation. They tend to know their clientele pretty well and is a very collegial atmosphere. My earl grey latte was pretty good too, though I wish it was a tad sweeter (which you can definitely make sweeter on your own). This place has wifi too, but you have to ask them while at the counter."
4,"Had a great Labor Day weekend in Nashville for the UGA-Vanderbilt football game. The city was even better than we expected. Ended our Sunday and had a great time Sunday night at Ole Reds. Great music from 2 bands (JC Anderson Band & Taryn Papa Band), great food and atmosphere. We will definitely be back from Atlanta this fall."
3,"If you love stuffed grape leaves like I do, you have to come here.  You also have to love couscous, golden raisins and goat cheese and fresh herbs.  Hands down the best stuffed grape leaves in St Louis."
4,"Really amazing. the food and service were outstanding. Not sure I'll ever stop by Nashville again, but sure will miss this great restaurant!"
0,"Thought it would be neat to spend the night in this retro famous motel. There were body fluid stains on the sheets. The ""padding"" between the fitted sheet and mattress had stains and pubic hair stuck to it. The bathroom door handle was missing the locking mechanism and it wouldn't  even close. Desk chair that was upholstered had stains all over it. Thankful there wasn't carpet on the floor. We'll never recommend this location. If you want to see the famous Drake I suggest you just drive through the parking lot and look from your vehicle."
4,"We have not been to this place since Mr B's.  We were looking for somewhere we had not been before and decided to try Lou C's.  Glad we did .  Had the Lou C's burger dipped in Lou C's sauce and smoked gouda.  One word,  Yummy.   We will be back."
3,"First time here, didn't realize it had so many whiskeys! I might go back just for that. The food was really good and had huge portions. Burger was cooked perfectly, pork was perfect, Mac and cheese was creamy and paired well with the caramelized onions and the nachos were a pleasant surprise of new flavors I really enjoyed. The only item I didn't care for was the sweet tots. They were way too sweet, I may have preferred them without the sugar coating. Plenty of other menu items that looked good, I can't wait to go back!"
3,"We just purchased a car for our daughter from Lezlea at Parks Ford of Wesley Chapel. We test drove it a couple of days ago and got a great deal. Lezlea called us and followed up with us as we researched and made our decision. When we went back in today everything was prepared for us, expediting the buying process. Lezlea was very professional and didn't pressure us to commit. We could tell she was a mom by the kind way she treated our 16 year old daughter. If you're looking for an honest, kind car salesperson, go see Lezlea!"
2,I did an online checkin at 2:30 for a 5:30 arrival time.  I am at this point not even sure why they offer that service as I have been sitting in a room for 2 hours.  This office closes in 26 minutes so now I am wondering what the chances are that when I do see someone they will be able to do an xray that I need. I am a nurse everyone knows we don't go to the doctor till after all of our self diagnosis has failed.  Really irritated at this time hope I see someone soon.
2,"Average beer , good food in a industrial space and weird part of town."
4,First time to Happy Fish. While visiting Tampa this place was recommended. We checked Yelp and had great reviews as well as TripAdvisor. The owner Kevin and the waitress Danielly provide the best customer service. amicable and attentive. Fast service. The food was great. We order to share one of their fried rice which was more than enough for two. We also had the Tacu Tacu which is a special rice and beans with steak and eggs. Different but delicious. We highly recommend this restaurant for a Peruvian experience. By the way on weekends they have life music we were told.
3,Good bar food. Seafood bisque was pretty good. Staff was on point. Live band was a nice surprise. Overall good experience on a Sunday afternoon.
3,"A lot of people refer to Rusty's as a local dive. It really isn't a dire, if so it's at the higher end of that scale.  There's 2 separate areas, one is more of a restaurant style sit down and the other is the sports bar. The sports bar has and upper and lower level with plenty of seating for people during game days. Food and drink is reasonably priced and services is good.  They serve typical bar food and it is nothing spectacular but I must say the wings are pretty darn good."
4,this has got to be the best chinese an american food i have had in a long time. i come here almost every day. the service is fast the cashier is always smiling and greets me each time i come in. they are fast pace and food is cooked to perfection great place to eat dine in is wonderful as well. if you are going anywhere else in saint louis stop and come here
3,"Had the Carnitas Fajitas for lunch after shopping the mall.  Solid ""Mexican"" food for the American pallet.  Enjoyed Dos Equis amber on tap.  Reasonably priced lunch menu.  Service attentive."
2,"I actually really like this place. I love the location and the brunch samplings. I think their coffee is good, but it's not amazing and I would prefer something fair trade/organic. I had to knock off a couple of stars because they close early (2pm on Saturday??) and the staff is hit or miss with friendliness."
4,"Awesome job Mr. Starr!  
Wish u had it going on when I was a kid growing up in philly town. 
Great food, ambiance and a super staff. 
Great music. 
Love u man. 
Visiting my Ma today for her birthday from the DC area 
Enjoying walking thru the square."
0,"I was there Saturday, May 13.  I ordered a slushi shake and a Chicago hotdog.  They had one girl delivering food.  It took nearly 30 mins for my order.  My hotdog was stone cold."
3,"Great cuts at decent prices. Staff is super friendly and responsive to feedback. They also have a great memory on previous cuts, not sure if there is a database supporting that or not. For guy cuts, the stylists have a great sense of modern style. The shampoo is basically an intense scalp massage and it feels great. Overall, great place that is surprisingly affordable given it's location and appearance."
4,Stopped in for some beignets and cafe sua da and this place blew away my expectations!  It was probably the best tasting beignets and cafe sua da (iced coffee) I've had in my life!  I'll be sure to stop by there next time I am in the NOLA area!
4,"Such an awesome place! My fiancée and I will never go anywhere else! I saw Will and he sees Chris, but everyone there is friendly anytime we go in. You really can't go wrong!"
4,"One of the best Pizzas I've had in my entire life. Great beer, great atmosphere, and phenomenal food. I've been their twice now and everything I've tried has been awesome"
4,"Hands down my favorite pizza place in town. Great for big groups, BYOB... and of course amazing pizza! I personally love the Diavola pizza- but they really have something for all the pizza lovers out there. You can tell the dough is made in house definitely not frozen. We love to get a big group, couple bottles of wine and watch games on the projector screen in the bar area. Shout out to Logan- he is awesome and takes good care of us when we come in!"
3,"I really enjoy staying at this place and is where I stay at when I'm in Santa Barbara for business.

The rooms are well appointed, well maintained, and of a reasonable size. 
The staff is very friendly and helpful. 
The grounds and facilities are great for roaming around or for just siting. 
The location is awesome. Being right across from the beach and walking distance to downtown.
Pricing is a high -compared to the room and amenities- but It is in the normal range for the location.

My routine is to stop by the lobby for a warm cookie and a bottle of water to enjoy during my evening walk."
0,"Very poor service, we waited at a table for food and drinks for almost an hour, finally gave up on drinks. The restaurant was more than half empty at the time"
4,Absolut empfehlenswert. Die gegrillten Austern (chargrilled Oysters) waren wirklich sehr lecker; der Preis ist auch sehr fair. Zu zweit haben wir ohne Probleme einen Tisch bekommen; größere Gruppen (4+) sollten wahrscheinlich lieber vorher reservieren.
4,"Wow - I absolutely LOVED this toy store. It is chock full of cool toys that encourage imaginary play. You won't find name brand stuff here (Disney, Lego, whatever), and I actually find that very refreshing as a parent. 

As a bonus, they do in store events, AND have really nice gift wrapping.

Shop local, parents, and check this place out!"
3,"Good pizza, giant thin slices, fast service. Not the best pizza that I've ever had but pretty darn good!"
4,Got the lunch special! My mini thin crust pizza was so good I also went to order another one. The salad bar is fresh and tasty with lots of salad toppings options. Great location with lots of space to move around!
4,I eat here on a regular basis and have tried not to eat the same thing twice because it's all amazing. The hot and sour soup is some of the best I've had and the pineapple chicken is fire. The staff is friendly and really quick with getting the food out I've never waited more than 5 minutes and couldn't be happier with the experience I get every time I go.
4,Bonsai Koi Ponds is the best location in TB for fresh water ponds and Koi fish. Bob's Koi are beautiful! Huge selection; great prices. Very knowledgeable!
4,"Great food at reasonable prices, fun atmosphere and most importantly awesome and friendly staff that make you feel at home!"
3,"Very very nice, great service. Sat outside. Happy hour started at 2 had a glass of Chardonnay and ordered the Brie sand which, vegetarian:) my boyfriend and his friend had chicken and waffles and my mother had the burger no donut as the bun. Everyone loved their meals and only additions made were melted butter to the waffles to give it some extra moisture.  Would comeback great sauce selection too  happy!"
4,Amazing! It does have a bit of a fast food feel but served on actual plates with rolled silver wear. I had the gyro while my partner had a wrap and we split the feta fries. Everything looked so fresh. The lettuce was crisp and the tomatoes were still firm. The staff (I wish I got names) were very pleasant and patient since this was our first time there and also showed up 15 mins before closing. I hate doing that but they still provided great service. I will be back anytime im im spring hill. I highly recommend.
0,"Just called this store to ask if they had Vinyard Vines coolers. I was transferred numerous times to all the wrong departments and then no answer called back and the same mess. They Need new management, not to redo the store and still have bad service.. all other locations are so much better."
3,"Stopped here for lunch last week - sat at bar.  Super fast & friendly service... great chicken parm sandwich.
Will go back & try pizza some day."
0,doggy pig pen!!!   avoid it  It's for people too lazy to walk a dog
4,"Great place. Most of the casinos in town have a steak house that they seem to put a decent amount of effort. And they're usually pretty good. 

But don't go to them, go here instead. The food is as good or better, it's usually cheaper, and they have a more varied and interesting menu."
2,Over the years this has been a place for reliably tasty Thai food.  Excellent service.  The main selling point for me is that it is open on Sundays when the other Thai restaurants on the WB are not.
0,Had reservations for 545  we got there place was empty except for bar. Hostess sat us in front of bar on stage where band plays.  At 6 band starts setting up  while we are eating.    Asked to move to new seats.   Got very rude reaction from hostess and staff.   PLACE WAS STILL EMPTY PLENTY OF OPEN TABLES!!!  First and last time going there.   Food ok but overpriced.   Go elsewhere. Plenty of good friendly places in media.
3,I love Dat Dog. I always get the gator sausage or smoked. I remember when they first started and how small and intimate the business was. Now they have grown to be very Successful. Service is kinda slow but i believe its due to the crowds. I would suggest middle of the day middle of the week. They are cash only but most spots in Nola are. Its how small businesses roll here. New Magazine street location is cute too.
4,"Great new place in Westchase. Coffee and teas are exceptional and prepared well. Staff are very friendly. 
I worked out here with a couple of business meetings while having both breakfast and lunch. Both of which were very good. (Order the Waldorf salad)
I had both coffee for breakfast with freshly squeezed orange juice. For lunch I had cold tea. Very refreshing.
Happy to have this place open and in the middle of Westchase."
1,"Terrible service because of the rude hostess. She told us there was a 10 minute wait for back area. There were a few people in the back area and handful of people inside. 
No explanation given. She didn't even advise us to sit at the bar or "" sorry were short handed today"", nothing. She didn't care. We left."
3,"Five stars for the quality of the cocktails and the service, without reservations.  The ""atmosphere"" is a bit faux Los Angeles for my taste, however, and it's a tad of a local's price range for regular visits, sadly."
4,"Very Happy in Nolensville: I had an issue with CO2 alarms going off one evening. Reliance sent out the first crew to identify the problem and found a gas leak at the garage water heater. Not satisfied they had completed cleared the cause of the CO2 issue they set out additional technicians who found a compromised vent pipe on the water heater. I am so grateful for the diligence to keep my family safe. Thanks to Manuel and his team, Tim and Nick for there great care and customer service. Extremely impressed!!! Steve"
3,"i ordered the first and only lamb with rice and potato here during lunch. they made good lamb, it was soft, juicy, delicious. and potato stew was fine (couldn't get another scoop though :( ), but I'm not a fan of rice and naan. rice was oily and naan was way too dry. and I don't think the rice went well with the lamb for some reason. 
do I like it? sure. but there are all these good restaurants here that I haven't been, I'd only come back if some people want to try this place."
4,"I love love love ReTress and anytime I make it down to Tucson I make sure to stop by Sephora since this is like the only place in AZ that sells it. I had a baby about 7 months ago which means half my hair fell out and this is the only stuff that seems to give me results in hair growth. But every time I go in there, the employees are super nice and helpful and I just love coming here. It makes up for the hassle of having to drive to Tucson well worth it."
3,I've eaten here several times. The only problem I have is making a decision on what to order
4,"Finding a salon that can tackle us cool blondes is scarce! The gentlemen here understand how important it is to rid any yellow or gold hues that blondes tend to produce!!!! I've always been a salon jumper, only because the look I wanted was impossible to achieve. I am happy that I found one that I can trust with my LONG blonde locks! This place rocks :))))"
2,"Easy to find on Bourbon Street. 
Food is made to order. 
Staff was friendly. 
Decor is a solid meh. 
Appeared cleanish. 
Prices were a bit high. 
Ordered:
3 piece chicken tender - fine, no better than Popeyes
Biscuit - ok, little sweet 
Fries - Typical, again not better than Popeyes"
3,"Clean, friendly management and great food. Its good quality bbq food without the extreme prices you see elsewhere. Id recommend this place to everyone."
0,"They pre-fill their cannoli (WHYYYY?) and their cheesecake is probably the worst that I've ever had. It had a gummy/chewy texture, especially at the top. The ""crust"" was also not particularly crusty or crunchy, but rather soggy. Staff wasn't especially nice either."
4,"Great store, the staff is super helpful, friendly and professional. I love this Petsmart and drive out of my way to shop here due the the way this store is ran."
2,"Service was good and the food was good.  My expectations were high, but attainable.  I ordered the redfish and crab special and with more sauce brought to the table, it was a good meal, but the hustle and bustle of a chaotic restaurant and slow execution from the kitchen made for the 3 star review."
4,"I always order the house salad grilled or cob salad grilled, never once disappointed. The salad is always mixed with freshly cleaned/spun romaine lettuce and fresh ingredients. This place is a guarantee of great food, and freshly brewed iced tea. Will be back often! Just keep up the consistency of your food, and service."
4,This store is a St Pete gem. It has the widest variety of local selections that we have seen while walking around beautiful downtown St Pete.  Will visit again soon.
3,I come here fairly often. They have pretty decent food and drink selection. Sometimes if you go during a week day service is just a bit slower but nothing to be angry about. I go here so often I wish they would switch up the menu a bit. Comfortable seats with a desk attached.
1,"Wow, this place smelled bad.  But they do serve alcohol.  Just sit outside."
4,"After trying on what felt like 100 dresses in 8 months, my sister convinced me to fly home to FL, and give Jon's bridal a try. My appointment was with Shari, and she was incredibly sweet, patient and professional. Shari helped me find exactly what I was looking for and more, and for the first time I actually felt beautiful in a wedding dress! I highly recommend Jon's Bridal. Don't forget to ask for Shari!!!"
3,"I love the Abington Pharmacy because it's open really late if you need to fill a prescription after 9 pm. Also they have candy behind the counter (the gummy kind I like) by the pound. It's also a good place to buy little gifts like Thymes fragrances, lotion and soaps. Their prices on these items are much better than the boutiques where they're usually sold."
4,"Always pleasant, get the job done without trying to pressure sell the extras. This is one of the few places I go without my husband because they are always straight with me. In the past I've had run ins with condescending mechanics but never here. Have been to them 3 times now in the past year (1 tire patch, 1 tire replacement, and just today a tricky hitch install on my Subaru.) Every time great, courteous service. Thanks guys!"
0,"ignorant and unprofessional employees. Just another philly worker. 

When a customer ask for locations if certain items, you do not need to snicker or smack your tongue. Just because you hate your job, dont take it out on the customers."
0,I ordered a slice.  Pepperoni. Onions.  Mushrooms.   It turned out to be a Pre cooked pepperoni slice with RAW COLD mushrooms and options on top.  Had two bites and threw it out.   I never throw our pizza.   Disappointed.
4,"Stopped in tonight to redeem my free birthday pizza that you get for signing up for their rewards. Was greeted right away, he looked up my rewards and we also ordered two drinks and toasted ravioli. Food came out right away and was hot and delicious! Guys behind the counter were very friendly and attentive. I asked for ranch and a to go box and they were super nice! Other customers came in during my visit and if one guy was on the phone taking orders another came up from the back right away to help walk in guests. Great location to dine in!"
4,"We Love our local U Haul center. Vehicles in all Shapes and Sizes. Was So Simple. Wow!!! Instead of paying a Junk Dealer a small fortune for carting off our old furniture,  we hauled it off ourselves. The rental process took a while, but the drop off was handled by Miguel. He is a Class Act. Thank You U Haul. You Rock!!! Reserve yourself a truck today!!!"
3,"I stayed at this hotel in August. It's functional and clean. It was very busy when I was there, the area for the breakfast was too small and the staff unable to keep the food out quick enough. Nice rooms, I had an upgrade to a bigger room on the top floor. I would return to stay here again. Not spectacular but nothing wrong either."
4,"Best cheesesteak!!! Wow! Impressive for an out of the way storefront shop. But hey those are usually the best!!! Great quality, portion, price and service!! We will definitely come here again the next time we come to Philly!! Forget Gino's or Pats this place should be at the top of the list!!!!"
4,Love it here! Been coming here for almost a year now and I won't go anywhere else. They keep up on what's in style but you can always bring in a picture of what you want. Each person I've had has been great.
4,"I don't normally post but I had to share a review.  RC Appliance was professional, on time, and quick to give an accurate diagnosis.  The serviceman was obviously knowledgeable and experienced.  They gave tips on how to save money and did not try to charge us for items/work not needed.  My only complaint is the fact that I had to wait a week to get my washer fixed but it was well worth the expertise and professionalism.  I will definitely use RC Appliance again."
2,Just ate Client burgers. It was beyond disgusting. I really want my money back . Taste like compressed regurgitation.
4,"Loving the new Whole Foods in town! The Callowhill location needed a face lift...badly! I'm so excited to see all of the local offerings (Dizengoff, Cheesesteaks, Soft Pretzels, etc...) they incorporated into the store. The level of quality and service surpasses any other grocery store in center city. I can't wait to go back :)"
3,"Super fun! The cover charge to get in was $10.00. The drinks were reasonably priced. I believe for a 18oz sharable bucket I payed $15.00. 

Live entertainment  was a plus. Kinda crowed however that's expected on a Saturday night. The dance floor/ area is kinda small. However, there's a lot of seating available if you get there early enough. Overall,  I enjoyed my time."
0,"The worst gel refill and polish I've ever had.  Wanted to save some weekend time, so figured I'd make good use of a lunch hour and I went to this place.  Crooked, bumpy, thick, and apparently Lee, my technician, saw no need to polish the edges of my nails.  Had a dark color on my nails that she didn't completely remove before applying the light color that I was replacing it with, so I still had remnants of the old polish.  Really, save your time and money.  Go somewhere else.  Absolutely terrible."
0,"The woman who helped me, Leslie, gave me considerably less food than everyone else in my family for what she helped me with (shrimp and chow mein). I paid over a dollar more for shrimp and only got five! I know this is not the norm. I come often and always get more food. I feel that her customer service is poor and she purposely gave me less. Very disappointed with this location."
0,"The service has been so slow and so poor the last 3 times I have been to Eureka I decided to do Yelp review in hopes that the manager will see it and improve service so we can go here again. 
We love the food....just can't handle the slow service.  
Am hopeful it will improve. 
Not sure if there is new manager but am sad that we can't support this yummy restaurant anymore!"
0,Really bad experience. Staff doesn't know what they are doing. Strongly suggest to adopt elsewhere. Very poorly managed.
4,"My doc suggested I try Cropwell when I needed a particular generic brand of medicine. Some pharmacies are reluctant to deal with some of the meds I require.
Jared has been welcoming from my first visit.
No issues with the staff either. Fast service!"
3,"Nice little spot to get some work done while drinking some flavorful tea. Got the personal teapot with the black peach tea, really good."
0,Called to make an appointment. Guy answered said they're closed. When it says they are open and he obviously answered the phone. Extremely rude. Then he hung up on me!! Ass$ole
4,Luv the place!  It's clean the service is great and the best part the recliners.. comfort!!!  5 stars!!  And I'm super picky..
3,I came here a couple of months ago with my husband for lunch and the food is quite tasty and you get enough for your money.  The tea was good to go with my fish sandwich and my husband ordered a fried pork chop.  The sides were delicious as well. The atmosphere is cool however we sat at the bar area on very awkward metal stools.  Next time I come I will eat outside or at a regular seat.
1,Being from buffalo I'm a little surprised these wings are breaded?takes away from the taste . That said these wings were decent but great by south jersey standards. Do yourself a favor and go to buffalo.
2,"Ongs is one of the first places I've ever had a noodle soup when I was but a youngin.  It's really value for it's money, but it's not super different than other Vietnamese places in Chinatown."
4,"Food was great.  We tried a variety of different dishes.  The craw puppies were excellent.  As was the New Orleans Medley, and seafood etouffee.  Service was fast, friendly and very efficient.  I highly recommend anybody coming to New Orleans to stop in for dinner."
3,"Another place that does the basics very well. We usually eat breakfast, so I'll isolate the review to that menu. They are always great at modifying things to fit our family's special needs, diet-wise. And it's consistently good. Worth the wait (there is usually quite a wait)."
4,"I'm a sucker for home cooked southern buffets.  Fred's did not disappoint.  The Fried Green Tomatoes were awesome as was the Sweet Potato Bake.  I'm not usually a fan of corn but when you add in bacon and jalapeños, well the story changes."
4,"Love this place! The food, the atmosphere and especially the service!!! Deaja was a delight!!!"
3,"Quick, Efficient, Friendly & Affirdable

Cool jukebox spinning Aretha, Elvis & Johnny Cash.

Diner food with a greasy spoon.  Git ya sum."
2,Its ok. Bland bar food. Extensive menu. Creative but again not that savory. Big space small tables. Great service.
4,Went on a Sunday evening and the place was nice and quite with only a few other customers. The service is excellent and the food was a lot better than I expected considering how unusual the menu was. I ordered the Dolsat Bibimbap and it was super fresh and tasty with a great size as well. I will definitely be going back again
0,"The person who takes orders can't speak english, keep messing up the orders ! I am done with this place!!"
4,"OMG!! While traveling around, I asked the guy at the gas station, ""Who has the best hot wings?""  He referred me to R&R Extreme Wings.  The person at the register recommended the ""Founders Favorite"" Flavor.  I ordered the 20 piece meal.  WOW!!  This is delicious!!  My new favorite wing spot!!!"
4,"YAY!  2nd floor bowling alleys rock!

Cheap lanes, cheap beer, and friendly staff make this place a winner in my book.  AND the old school scoring is awesome.  Good thing I can add!

Sooooo much fun.  Go in a group!"
4,"If I could give more than five stars, I would! I have been coming to Cross Culture with my friends and family for over 4 years. (I've been meaning to write a review). I absolutely love the food here. I've had multiple dishes and everything is outstanding. The Korma and Tikka Masala are my absolute favorites. The staff is friendly and accommodating. This is the best Indian food I've ever had. Also, it's BYOB, and there is a liquor store in the same shopping center. Super convenient!"
4,Amazing food! We live in the area and wanted to try something new for date night. The service was prompt and the buffet was well stocked. The meat was hot and fresh and continued to come by the table. We also enjoyed the casual dining atmosphere. This place does look like a hole in the wall but is definitely worth a try. I would recommend this place to anyone.
2,"I helped a buddy of mine lug a few cases from his local beer distributor the other week and felt that I needed to write an update on Bella Vista Beer.

Compared to the chaos of unlabeled stacks of beer cases and a push-pin price board of the other beer distributor I saw, Bella Vista's ordered rows and labels seem like the Taj Mahal.  Slide the star-o-meter up one notch for organization.

See the rest of my review below for some things you still need to watch for at BVBD."
4,"Great food awesome pricing hidden gem. Staff friendly service is quick. 

Give it a try won't disappoint."
4,"Everything about our experience was very good. Warm greeting by the host staff, great food and exceptional service. We went with our waiters recommendation for drinks and appetizers. Definitely try their bourbon cocktails and get the avocado bomb appetizer - both were delish! I got the prime rib and my husband got the ribs - both cooked perfectly. We shared to bokchoy side and loved it. Really, I have nothing to complain about with our experience. Thought it was all well worth the price."
3,"AJ admitted that she was overwhelmed with the response from the Groupon she offered and had some trouble keeping appointments straight.  She was very apologetic and gave me a bag of goodies at my make-up date.  I have since returned... her hours are great, and she tends to have last-minute openings."
4,Excellent service. Had an unexpected under carriage problem on a road trip and we got it fixed here quickly and for a great price! Thank you! I would highly recommend this place!

0,"If I could leave a negative review I would. The impolite woman working the register picked up the phone, without even hearing my voice and accused me of harassment and threatened to call the police. When I came in and mentioned that it was not me, she said that I was more than welcome to never frequent her ramshackle establishment. Save yourself the headache of enduring a 60's era level of customer service ... if you catch my drift and go somewhere were you won't get treated like dirt."
1,"Food was good the two times I ordered it. Today I ordered through the app and was told I could pick up in 15 to 30 minutes. 20 minutes later I am almost at the store and they call to tell me I can pick up in an hour because they are ""changing the oil"" in their fryer. REALLY? IT'S GAME DAY! I asked if they could deliver instead since I have company over she said sure for a fee. For the inconvenience it should have been free. We requested to cancel and she immediately said ""sure"" and hung up the phone. Great work."
0,"THE most disgusting hotel I have ever stayed at. Found food in the bed GROSS! Spoke with the front desk & they were unconcerned & rude. We tried the hotel lounge, service was very slow especially considering there were hardly any people there. The only redeeming factor up at this hotel was the roof top restaurant where we had perfect service & a lovely time. I explained our experience with the bartender who turned around & told the restaurant manager, she came over very concerned & apologetic. Not at all what I expected from a Grand Hyatt."
3,"I usually don't like to eat hot pot because multiple people have to use the same soup pot, but this place was different, they have different small hot pot for each person and its good because we all have different taste and i feel more comfortable for not using the same pot. I ordered miso soup based with spicy and they put the spicy sauce on the side so i can add how much i want. The food taste good and also the price. The service is nice but they do have a mistake in taking order. However this is a nice place for hot pot. Will come back !"
3,Waiting time can always improve but food is always good. My fifth time since it's opened and it's been consistently good.
3,"Delise!  Love this bakery.  Wished they had more south locations.  I used to go here all the time back at home (Chicago).  They offer great lunch choices: sandwiches, paninis, flatbreads, pasta, bakery items, etc.  Breakfast is very limited though.  Best to come for lunch."
4,"Heather is a TRUE professional. She is a perfectionist at everything she does. I was going to get lashes done just for the summer, but she does such an incredible job, I keep coming back. I would trust Heather with my lashes, eyebrows, hair, make-up -- you name it! I always get asked where I get my lashes done....thanks Heather!"
3,"Take out only for the Covid era.

So this is a more upbeat and milder version of a Korean food establishment. Something's taste sweeter and not so spicy or heavy on the garlic or char.

They have brewed iced tea. A plus for me.

The sporks and containers are biodegradable and also fun to eat out of. I like the black drinking cups, too.

I paid $2 for a upgraded size and it was enough for a couple to enjoy."
1,"We took our mother to DP hospital for 2 procedures. She has dementia. When they called her name, we were told that we couldn't go back with her. Despite us telling them of her dementia, we were told to stay in the waiting room. She is unable to answer most questions correctly. This makes us feel very uneasy. Hopefully, all goes well. We feel like it is out of our hands. You shouldn't feel this way when you take a loved one to the hospital."
4,"Best Ice Cream in the State! Been going for 20 years and they consistently have a great variety of in-house flavors, great customer service and a clean place!"
2,"This is a cute little store just behind State St. in Newtown. There's a fair selection of shoes at different price points, and sometimes you can get a good deal on sale. They also have a ton of cute handbags and other accessories. The service is a bit detached, but helpful nonetheless."
3,I final received my reedplates and my Delta Frosts are sounding great!!!!! Thanks Bushman...Jon you came thru.
4,"From the hostess, to the bartender, and every other server (they use team effort); to a person the service was outstanding. Oh,the food, just the same.  Wonderful atmosphere and fair pricing.  This place is worth the drive; keep up the great work!"
2,"Popped in for drinks with a group of people after dinner.  Service was a bit slow to get beers.  Maybe a keg blew, but it just seemed slow compared to other places.  

We will try another night for dinner and see how it works out."
0,This place is terrible. Every room smells like someone puked on the floor and then they tried to clean it up but failed but still left the carpets wet with toxic cleaning agents. Management has been unhelpful and at times rude. It was so bad we left our room at 1:30 am to switch hotels. Oh and it's the weekend of our wedding so we also brought about 60 other rooms of business to this fourth rate sh!thole. I can't stress enough that you should stay away. Terrible establishment. Disgusting. Avoid. Seriously.
3,"Watch your bill. I ordered and paid at the bar. When I asked went to pay the bartender, he told me my total $160 and returned change without itemized. When I asked for the itemized, it seems and issue for him as it was already closed. I insisted and he brought it to me minutes later. Charged me for a $10 beer I didn't drink. Seemed shady. As for the food!! Great bbq and sides. Just eat and enjoy but with eyes open."
4,Loved the place. The waiter (wearing a hat ) was extremely nice to us. He always changed coal without us asking him to or without charging. He was so kind and polite and really knew how to give the best service. I really really liked their service and all thanks to that waiter !!!! He rocked his job!!!! There should be more waiters like that young man:)
4,AMAZING! From the service to the food it's great. Food takes no time at all. Seasoned to my liking and fresh!!! One of the best brunch spots in philly.. will not disappoint. Prices a little high but for good reason.
4,"The best bakery around in Dunedin!!! We just went to the grand opening today! We got the gluten free chocolate chip cookie, a regular scone with cream and jam, and a cranberry crisp bar. Everything was amazing!! 

Tips- pay the extra $1.00 each for the cream and jam for the scone. It made it 10 x better!! 

The gluten free cookie was thin and sooooo tasty. We loved the texture of the cookie. One was a little crispy and one was a little softer but both totally amazing!"
3,Darling little ice cream shop in downtown Reno. It can be hard to find--we circled the block a few times before realizing it was within a courtyard. The flavors are unique and have things like lavender and other herbs. Super refreshing and different from traditional ice cream. Worth checking it out if you're in the area.

I attempted to eat at this location, but after sitting for 15 minutes without any service whatsoever, I decided to leave. Tables seated after me ordered drinks, got their drinks, and ordered food, but I hadn't even been approached with a simple ""Hello"" or ""I'll be with you in a moment."" 2 severs in the place, and they both looked at me multiple times. Ridiculously terrible service - How about appreciating the customers you have in the middle of this construction zone?"
3,"I live here and travel every other week. 
Usually, it is pretty good, have to say
but most of the time, the TSA makes it less so.
But Yesterday, the TSA was super in that every person
was nice, polite and helpful. That was a first for me at any airport.
I have had my share of arguments with them and complaints on them
but it wouldn't be fair of me if I didn't share when they were actually nice!"
4,Finding a honest auto shop is always a gamble but looking at other reviews on yelp I found this place. From the start of the Initial phone call everything was good from beginning to end. Mark was the one who was helping with my vehicle the most. Didn't recommend anything that didn't needed to get done just what the problem was when I brought it in. For that I decided to go ahead and fix whatever was needed while the vehicle was there. This place is be my go to for all my vehicles and future work I will need. Very straight up and honest ppl here.
4,"GET THE HILL SALAD.
For me the best salad. Ever. Remeber read an article off a food magazine saying it's jolly good. But it's way better even than the description. The mixed texture and the sauce are definitely the result of drawing inspiration from the creationist's book. The pickled jalapeno and olive is a genius stroke.

The rack is adorably spicy! I just love spicy food. And it's so well-seasoned!"
4,"Came to support the spring ford high school at the New Jersey mikes!  Super service,  great menu choices and a very clean dining room.  The staff was courteous and quick.  We had a cheese steak, club supreme and a super sub and all three got rave reviews!  We will be back!"
1,"With restaurants like Fellini's and Ariana down the road, why would you go anywhere else for Italian food? The apps are good, but we tried four entrees and didn't enjoy the taste of any of them (eggplant parmesan, ravioli, fettuccini, and the grilled chicken dish). Too bad because the waitstaff was very friendly and it's cozy and cute inside!"
4,Great find on the beach.  Superb Italian food.  Everything fresh from the market in the morning.  Had Stefano's Seafood over linguine and the hog nose snapper special.  Both prepared exquisitely.  Restaurant had nice and cozy feel and charm. Definite go to again! and Again!
3,"I've been going to the March Hare for about 6 months now.   I get a great hair cut every time..my hair is very short (and thin).   That is a challenge to hair stylists...there is no room for mistakes.  Since having Carmen cut my hair I frequently receive unsolicited compliments.  Proof that I'm getting a great cut.  

It's a great location, a down-to-earth place, and...best of all, the prices are extremely reasonable."
0,$999 doc fee to do the paperwork? Are you out of your mind? I have bought over 20 cars in my life never paid more than a $100 for a doc fee! Rip off!
3,"Always a good price on gas, a little awkward getting in and out...bur the road traffic tends to be accommodating"
3,Overall a positive experience.  The interior space is nicely designed and they offer complimentary wine or champagne with a service.  Two points for improvement...please train front desk staff on products and the massage should be longer on the pedicure considering the price.  Also perhaps setting some standards for massage would be a good idea to ensure quality amongst the customers.  Very friendly people and an enjoyable experience.
3,"The raving Facebook reviews about freshness brought me through the front door & I have to say, it's true!! Best cupcakes I've ever had. The fresh ingredients really set them apart from other bakeries. Only 2 cons (which wouldn't keep me from going): they don't list prices inside & there is a ton of sweet icing atop these little gems. We've gotten a dozen on two separate occasions now & they have been amazing."
2,"Great rolls at this place. 
The sandwiches in general are flavorful. 
I have probably had take out here about a dozen times in the past five years. 

The salads are fresh and tasty.  Also huge!!! So one is enough for two people. 

The pizza is not my style at all.  It's thick and kind of oily. 

The delivery is awful.  So we don't do that anymore. 

Last pickup they forgot all my sides.  No cheese for fries, no blue for wings.   So that stunk.  

But this place is ok in my book"
0,Only if I've a quick crave for sushi and cheap. Yes cheap is the only reason that I'd walk in to this place. Sashimi is tasteless every single time.
4,"Omg! We sound like we are making love to our food!! Soooo goood!! Spicy Chicken and waffles. (The Highway Hot Chicken) Chicken breast is so tender and juicy. T for Texas breakfast with smoked brisket, jalapeño cheddar grits and a really good pesto with a hint of sweetness to it. Mini biscuits served with quality butter and raspberry jam.Blood Orange mimosa and coffee are on point. We came on a Tuesday morning, no wait. So glad we came here!"
4,"My family's favourite go-to restaurant! We love everything here. My mainstay is the ramen soup and fries! The pressed sushi is also a family favorite as well as the rice bowls. 
Service is always incredible and I love that they always greet you and thank you as you're leaving in Japanese!"
4,"Total order came to $24 and some change but only had $20 cash and ATM broken, the owner comped the difference for my inconvenience....
Not only great food but the service/people to match. Definitely hit this spot when you're in the quarters."
4,We can't begin to say how much we appreciate Paul Davis. Our house was diagnosed with mold by an environmental company and we discussed the results with our insurance company and they recommended Paul Davis. Paul Davis coordinated everything with the insurance company and all subcontractors. It was turn key and a wonderful experience.
4,"OMG! :D
I love this place. I was riding around yesterday just looking for a nice pizza place, one that isn't a chain like Pizza Hut or Papa John's. I wanted REAL pizza, and boy did I get it. I bought a slice of pepperoni, and it was divine! It was exactly what I wanted. And the slice was huge too! I'm definitely going there again!"
4,"I'm all for cute Ice Cream shops in cute neighborhoods, and this one didn't disappoint! There were more ice cream options than coffee, but the Lime Toasted Coconut was delish!"
3,"The exterior of Pepperoncini is completely unassuming-it looks like your average neighborhood bar. On the inside, however, it is a cozy Italian bistro with a great menu and nice wine selection. The atmosphere is comfortable and casual, not stuffy and the service, in my experience, has always been great. I definitely recommend sharing one of their pizzas with a bottle of wine while you watch a Phils game in the bar."
4,"First of all, I am Thai. I know what Thai food should be.
I stopped at this restaurant on the way to Solvang.  My husband and I were craving for Thai food and this place was not disappointed me. We had a chance to talk to the owner and had requested ""Thai Taste"". Food came out perfect! Spicy, well balanced as Thai food should be. It was busy at the time we went there but the service was spot on. Totally recommend this restaurant. We walked out with full happy tummy!"
4,This company has been amazing. We have 2 puppies with 90% coverage. They BOTH have had a leg surgery each in their first year and $4000 was reimbursed to us immediately for each. Our out of pocket was only 10%. One is a deformity our pup was born with and they paid for it with no question. I recommend them VERY highly.
2,"First time here.  The prices were awesome and the food was just ok.  Hubs says that the portions used to be larger.  Very diverse atmosphere, which makes it really comfortable.  I hear that it is a ""go to"" spot for after prom.  So, I will be avoiding that time. LOL  It is a typical diner experience."
0,If you decided to eat here check you're order 10 TIMES !! The only thing they can do constantly here is mess up you're food and either give you something wrong or just forget to give it to you at ALL !! This place needs better management to watch these kids who work there . Girl at the register shouldn't have to get her iPhone out to calculate my change
0,"OK...if you need to kill time and get a beer and chips and salsa, then your safe...If your thinking about ordering anything else...stay away.

I have several year long gaps in my history of visiting Abuelos and everytime the food is horrible and I get super sick off of anything I DO eat...
not worth wasting my time to review this place and not worth your time to visit.
Go somewhere else!"
4,"Everything was so tasty. I was not expecting this place to be so good. My steak was cooked to perfection, and the fish was delicious. Everything was worth it."
3,"What a hidden gem! We found this place as the Pancake Pantry's line was too long. Located in a non-descript house/building, the french toast is different but in a pleasing way. It doesn't use traditional white bread for the toast. The benedict and grits also are delicious. Good, attentive service and interesting decor. Get there early."
4,The Baked Cheese was amazing. My boyfriend and I are still talking about it. I posted a video of it on my Instagram and people were messaging me asking what it was. Definitely suggest this place!
1,"Very disappointed with the bowl of gumbo, which tasted OK, but the shrimp were small and I could see no crab meat.

The bread pudding was good.  Has raisins and a good sauce."
