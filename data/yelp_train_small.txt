__label__1	I don't get all the rage about this place.  Had breakfast, dry microwaved bacon and cold potatoes, at least the waitress replaced the cold potatoes with fresh out of the microwave warm ones.  Not impressed worst 12 dollar breakfast in town
__label__1	"Staying at the Nugget for the 4th and fireworks. Service was terrible! From Valet to hotel desk, rooms to restaurants. Employees act as if you are inconveniencing them. Customer service didn't exist. 

Room for 4 had two towels, and one kurig container of coffee. 

Valet was taking any car rather than confirmed overnight guests and was so backed up that cars were lined up on the city street behind the casino waiting to valet park. 

I get that is was extremely busy being the 4th however, isn't that when employees are supposed to be at their best?"
__label__1	Very petty stuff, I'm not going to prom because of them. The lady pushed me to buy something I didn't even try it on, she said I couldn't try the dress on, she was very annoying. Majority of the dresses had problems!
__label__1	"Long wait crummy attitude wrong order
Dont wast your time or money
Have been to many better ones"
__label__1	Called these guys for an estimate on a removal of a large tree on a Tuesday got VM so left a message Wednesday night they showed up at my place at 5pm with no phone call/ notice they were coming. middle of making dinner for my young kids. quoted me $3000-4500!! When I said I would call a couple more places they talked down other companies saying they would cost a lot more. (specifically said I was looking at about $6000 if I used other places)  I had the whole tree removed for $1200 from an other company. Way to pricey for the average joe :)
__label__1	If I could give 0 stars, I would. Is there a high school program that gives kids jobs at the local White Castle? Lol. This place is terrible. Like, it doesn't even seem real. Looks great. But certainly being ran into the ground. I know this has to be franchised, and someone is hiring they're children and friends from the school. It can't be corporate. This place is ridiculous.
__label__1	Cenlar isn't an absolute nightmare! During the year the had my mortgage I was reduced to tears on numerous occasions. They said they didn't have evidence of my homeowners insurance and despite me providing proof they purchased coverage for me and hiked my monthly payment by hundreds of dollars it took months to untangle. I was finally able to refinance  its been  a month and I still have not received the $1700 from my escrow account. This is the worst experience I've ever had.
__label__1	Nasty, burned, way overcooked omelet biscuit.  Do yourself a favor and drive 3 exits further north on I65 to the exit for Hwy 76 in White House.  The biscuits are always fresh and delicious, all morning long.  Not this sorry burned crap that they serve at the one off the long hollow pk exit.
__label__1	Have a groupon. Have tried calling numerous times with no answer. Mail box full. Sent an email request days ago with still no reply. Lost my money on this one! Buyer beware!
__label__1	Horrible.  My daughter had an abscess in her throat which had to be lanced.  The Doctor barely spoke to her just said what he was going to do.  He proceeded with a shot for anesthesia and immediately went into the procedure without letting the area numb.  My daughter cried the whole time.  This Doctor had no empathy and was very cold. JD
__label__1	In town from California due my father being in hospital across the street from this place. The absolute worst Mexican food and margarita I have ever digested. My drink came from a lemonade fountain looking machine. The beans were spoiled. Margaritas have no liquor and if you want liquor pay extra 7 dollars. The burrito was ok. The chips and salsa were good. The service stunk. I am on a airplane twice a week and always eat Mexican food. After 27 years of flying I have found the absolute worst Mexican food.
__label__1	"Hit or miss, but mostly a miss on the food quality. For the prices they charge you'd expect something much better than cheap frozen potatoes ""home fries"" (the term is questionable for what they give you) and watery bland omelettes cooked with vegetable oil."
__label__1	Rude employees! Been here twice and both times my husband and I were treated like we were bothersome and clueless. Will not be returning despite the location.
__label__1	"When I think ""taco shop"" three adjectives come to mind:  good, fast, and cheap.  This place goes 0 for 3.  Not even one?  Nope.  Swing-and-a-miss.  The service was slow, the tacos were tiny but not bad, and it was expensive.  A good taco counter would own State Street in Media, with this location and all the foot traffic.  Maybe the juice/smoothie part will carry this operation, cuz the taco business ain't gonna do it."
__label__1	The food was bad and the bartender had an attitude.  I suggest hitting subway instead.
__label__1	Horrible service. The staff is very rude. The food is cold. The utensils are dirty. This place gets worse and worse everytime I go back. From now on I will be going elsewhere.
__label__1	The person at drive thru was slightly snappy and rushed me ! No one was behind me during the entire process. Asked to melt the cheese more on my sausage egg  and cheese McMuffin and said it could not be done and then said after I said leave grill longer that I would have to wait and we ended up waiting anyway longer than I have ever waited even with a line around the restaurant. Cheese was not even melted.
__label__1	I was notified that the car I had inqu about was available and ready for purchase. I asked if they could verify that it was actually available because i was told that it wasn't several days prior. The salesman verified that it was with his manager. I drove 50 minutes to the lot. We had to then drive 15 minutes to another lot, which is where the car was located. When my sales went to get the key he was told that the car was not yet available and that they were giving someone until the following Monday to purchase the car. I was called on Monday and told the car was sold!
__label__1	You can not live on a name. We are here and have been traveled from Texas. Waited nobody said the kitchen was closed and after 20 minutes nobody ever took our drink order. BTW husband is an operator and trying to support while it's what it should be.  Come on.
__label__1	The rudest slowest staff I have seen at any racetrac. The staff has a don't give a shit attitude. Sorry I inconvenienced you. Including all the so called managers. I'll take my business else where.
__label__1	DO NOT GO HERE. I went there yesterday and they did an absolutely terrible job. My nails are already chipped and they couldn't have done a worse job. I work so much and never have the time to do things like this so I just want to cry. I didn't have time for them to fix it and they wouldn't give me a refund. I wasted so much money on something that was supposed to be enjoyable only to leave in tears. I will never return.
__label__1	The service was horrible and our server was rude. Our food came out in less than 5. Minutes. Not sure how they are running that operation, but if you are ordering an authentic Mexican meal, I would not expect it to be prepared in that little time. I celt as if our food was slapped together. This will be the last time I visit this restaurant.
__label__1	Worst service ever got the managers daughter for a waitress we ordered drinks and our food and 3 other people that were seated after us got their drinks and we were still sitting there waiting for 15 minutes she was too busy talking to take care of patrons we walked out and will never go there again...........
__label__1	The reviews are right! Lol. I should have taken their word for it, quality is just like any other McDonald's but omg either the wait time is crazy or they get your order wrong. Sometimes both. Super annoying quite frankly, so if you can avoid this particular location it would be in your best interest.
__label__1	"30 dollar car wash. 10 dollar tip.

Outside of the car looked great. Inside clearly wasn't touched at all. Asked them to redo it. Looked descent after. Just was thick on my dash showing it wasn't touched at all. Won't be going back."
__label__1	If you want to be treated like crap, go to emerald cutz. Had a 4:30 reservation, waited 20 minutes, then left. Didn't even acknowledge me. I even told them I had limited time and I had to go, they couldn't have cared less.
__label__1	Would love to give it a better rating, but they say they're open until 10 but when I called at 8:50  on a Saturday they were closed. Not a good way to run a business after you got a lot views on Facebook. I don't get.
__label__1	They dont let you cancel your account and literally are stealing money from me.  I cancel a week ahead of time and they still charged me and wont let me cancel.  Worst company I have ever dealt with and does not let you cancel online or change your account information to stop deliveries.  I called customer service and they stole money from my account when I thought my deliveries were cancelled.  I called the company and they are still trying to steal money from my account and make it impossible to cancel!!
__label__1	Horrible service and food wasn't satisfying. I ordered a bowl of seafood clear noodles and there was more noodles with little to no seafood at all. For the price to be on the pricey side of a Vietnamese cuisine, it's not worth it here. The waiters and cashier were also unfriendly.
__label__1	Avoid this place. ordered a hot sandwich and after waiting 40 min, finally asked for the manager. She blamed me for the lost ticket. I had already asked 2 employees but she told me I didn't check with her. Finally got my sandwich after 49 minutes. never once got an apology, she blamed me for asking a new hire instead of her. They have good food but the staff is highly incompetent. If you go in make sure you watch that your ticket gets placed correctly, apparently that's the customer's responsibility.
__label__1	Subpar food.  Gripper tacos had no flavor. Dry and tasteless. Rice and beans that accompanied the meal were tasteless also.  Award winning salsa tasted like jar salsa.  The guacamole was bland.  The only good thing was the grand margarita and cucumber margarita.  The server Kirk was great. Not real Mexican food at all.
__label__1	Don't eat here unless you like hair in your grilled steak burritos. Very disappointed because it was really good but can't stomach other people's body parts cooked in my food . My hair is not near as long as the foreign object in my food . Aren't hair nets required any more
__label__1	"There are very few times in life when I get a massage and come back more stressed out than I did going in, well this happened to be one of them.
Not the first or last place I would recommend  to anybody going to for this service in particular.That being said, don't go here! It's quite simple really, No one seems to know what they are doing.
Go to Greaber and Company instead!"
__label__1	Worst gas station ever!!!. The owners are rude. We went to pay for gas and to use the restroom. The owner couldn't tell on her cameras which pump we were and called us liars says that we wanted to use the restroom for free. News flash lady if we wanted to the restroom for free why did we hand u money for gas. On top of that her husband came out and started yelling at us. That is know way to run a business.
__label__1	I brought my dress to get hemmed at the bottom and not only was it extremely expensive, when I went to pick it up the dress was very wrinkly. When I'm already paying way more that I should be, I expect it to be done correctly.
__label__1	They do not answer the phone. You can't get on their website. You can't get in touch with anyone. They do not want to pay their workers. The list goes on what a horrible business wonder why they can't get workers.
__label__1	The employees called me a liar to my face and then argued with me. Omfg I'm livid. You lie about the price of an item and try to charge me more even though you saw the price it had on it and told me no that's the more expensive one. It's the same box. Then continued to fight with me. Very very poor customer experience.
__label__1	I used to order from this place all of the time but recently they have become very unprofessional. The delivery driver was irate over his tip amount and even began texting my phone after he left. Never eating here again.
__label__1	Poor service and management. Food is mediocre.
__label__1	Went to the drive through tonight at 3 am after a Halloween party and they told us they were closed and no longer taking orders because they would not be able to get everything done by morning if they kept taking orders... Isn't the appeal of jack in the box that they are open 24hrs?
__label__1	"Let me tell you about this place y'all. The waiter however was extremely nice and did his best to make things right. HOWEVER, the reason why this place deserves a 1 Star is the experience with the MANAGER. 

They had a problem scanning my credit card about 5 TIMES and didn't bother to compensate me for the WiFi connecting problem on their end. We waited for 30 minutes after their credit card WiFi connected and rudely left. 

I encourage the people who think this will be a good experience to rethink your choice. I will not be returning for future business and I'm extremely disappointed."
__label__1	Cramped tables, horrible service, will not be returning. The Gnocci was okay, the panchetta was delicious.  I ordered the Salmon and my wife the Bistro Steak.   The salmon had way to much going on.   Our waiter was inattentive.  The desserts were delicious though.
__label__1	Used to love North before the makeover...don't go anymore.
__label__1	Ordered a Cheesesteak with sweet peppers cooked in . The steak itself had no flavor and the sweet peppers had no taste . The meat is cheap . Don't waste your time ordering steak sandwiches. Give them one star for effort .
__label__1	"Don't waste your money.
Super salty.
Dry.
Cant believe I spent the amount of money I did on inedible food.
I never leave reviews but had to for this."
__label__1	I always heard about this place,but I was never in Camden or wanted to go to Camden to try .Today I ran an errand and was near Donkey's.I went in and I should of left asap when I sat down and the place was very dirty,the salt shaker was stuck to the table,just gross.I stayed and ordered their famous cheesesteak.YUK,frozen meat on a wet kaiser roll,for $7.Never again
__label__1	The ran out of flat bread and they make their living on flat bread!! I asked for butter and they gave me a cup. I surely do not understand this place. Over priced and less than average food with poor service. Not my first or even 10th choice.
__label__1	"This place has really gone downhill under the new ownership. Still great views of the water and Ben Franklin bridge, but the music has been god-awful (Bieber, Mariah Carey, etc. - really??) and the crowd has turned much more Like what you would see at Cavanaugh's River Deck (D-bag crowd).

This place used to be awesome when R5 opened/owned it. Great bands and DJs playing actual music, and much better crowd."
__label__1	"Avoid this ""hotel"" like the plague. You have been warned. Bed bugs were reported by my fellow conference attendees. The carpets are filthy and the hallways smell like urine. It's an over-priced Motel 6 without a fridge or microwave in your room. No free WiFi either."
__label__1	"After being a member at the LA fitness in North Carolina for around 6 months. I am greeted by this ""signature gym"" with a $175 installment fee and an added $15 monthly. Why would I pay $190 to wait 30 minutes for a bench and drive around the parking deck for what feels like days. I'll let one of the other 20+ gyms in town have my money just like you should probably do.."
__label__1	This place seems like it sprang up to serve the nearby retirement community. I ordered the chicken salad salad and was let down. The salad came out with the ingredients placed on top in an arbitrary fashion. The chicken salad itself was overly dry and only tasted like chicken. If there were spices in there, I did not notice.
__label__1	Food was not very flavorful. The duck dish had no flavor at all. The char siu fried rice was burnt and very rubbery. The lamb tasted just like lamb although it's side was decently flavored. Would not recommend at all.
__label__1	We came to the bar while on a party bus tour. We came inside got some drinks and stood by a table to drink our beverages and a security guard came up to us and very rudely told us we have to sit or get the fuck out here. He was going to make us throw our drinks out so we had to down them before I aggressively showed us out of the bar.
__label__1	Nauseous - fast service, large quantities, so much salt, shrimp soaking in what? Oil ,butter?  GREEK loved the glass trim and lights
__label__1	I don't really right review but, I am so irritated and frustrated.  I went through the drive-thru and it literally didn't move. The workers were dancing and basically not doing anything, while their drive- thru was full. After way basically 30-40mins I left. I really like Wendy's but this specific one really needs to be looked over or something, its ridiculous. If your craving Wendy's DO NOT go to this Wendy's at period. If it was an option to give them 0 starts I would.
__label__1	My experience was awful.  They were unprofessional and unreliable...items missing from move.  If you value your 'stuff' I'd suggest using someone else.  Not dependable or trustworthy IMHO.  They should have NO stars, but the review wouldn't post unless I chose one.
__label__1	"Ridiculous pricing for what you get, the menu changes remove the variety and increase pricing and the food app that was supposed to give proper rewards resets its points system without warning or reason. Smashburger is by far one of the most worthless burger chains to hit Idaho. 6 dollar shake the size of a small shake from
McDonald's? Insane."
__label__1	I parked in 4 stalls before I found one that worked. Smh It's always something with this location. I'm not eating here anymore.
__label__1	Been here 3 times.   Severely understaffed.   Horrible wait times even with thier bad automated appointment system.   Go somewhere else!!!!!!
__label__1	I ordered the five Wings in 5 fish I got the perch it was old soaked with oil greasy tasteless terrible the worst fish I have ever had a waste of 18 bucks I would recommend this place to my dog
__label__1	"This place is great...for people who love to be ripped off, taken advantage of, and lied to. I will never, ever return to this location unless it is to throw a steaming pile of feces at this location's head honcho named ""Cosmo"""
__label__1	Tonight was the most disappointing night I have ever experienced in my life it is subway restaurant. The little girl in charge at night did not want to be there did not take pride in her work do not care about her job it was embarrassing for me and my kids I will never ever go back until she is gone. I had to warm my sandwich up the way I wanted it when I got home and nothing turned out the way we wanted it she was completely worthless and I will never go back to Subway until there's another manager there or a different worker
__label__1	YEEEEEEEUCK!  I went there one time and that was the last time I would go.  The pizza was burned on the bottom and tasted HORRIBLE!  I have a friend that swears by this place.  I think she needs to be checked in a Betty Ford because I hated it!!
__label__1	"This BBQ is terrible. I'm used to amazing Texas BBQ, and this stuff is the worst ever. No way this place would last for 2 days there. 

I had the brisket sandwich, and I was questioning if it was even beef. The beans had something mixed in, that's not how Texas does it. 

I think this place give BBQ the wrong impression. The line was wrapped our the door and several people said it was the place to go. 

I didn't try any other BBQ here, but I promise it can't be worse than this."
__label__1	"Tasteless and stale food...hair found in one of the breads...stay away...

would agree wid one of the previous reviewers that for Bay Area residents this was way below average Indian food...this restaurant can only pull off in places where competition for Indian food is less and Santa Barbara fits that"
__label__1	Was approached about my yelp by a staff member and told I should be 86'd from the bar...I guess professionalism does not come cheap in Tucson.
__label__1	Perhaps the most uncomfortable and actually painful dining experience I can remember in my 66 years.  It was SO loud, we had to yell across the table to be heard. Our dinner order was bungled as were the checks. Often we give restaurants a second chance. Not so here; there are too many other great restaurants in this town.
__label__1	Terrible service.  Over two weeks, 3 appointments (never showed up once, twice unable to determine what the AC issue was), still hasn't been fixed.  Would give 0 stars if this were an option.  Utterly incompetent.
__label__1	"The lady rushed through applying my nails, my nails weren't painted right and were crooked.
I asked one of the ladies there to fix my nails and you could tell they were annoyed  save yourself the time, the money and the embarrassment of having horrible nails do not go here"
__label__1	"Don't use these guys!!!
They have you park your car in the hotel parking lot not behind the ""secured"" gate. Which wouldn't matter since the lot isn't manned by anyone anyway. 2nd The guy at the hotel desk where you register (oh yeah the booths on the lot aren't available right now) doesn't even pay attention to what he rights down. When your transportation carries a jug of motor oil you know your not in the safest vehicle for personal transport. Spend your money with a parking lot that does it right."
__label__1	It is 3:40 on October 19 and they are not open..... The sign says 3-10pm. Definitely not good for business that's for sure I will be visiting Ted Drews or some other business that is a little more reliable from now on
__label__1	The worst customer service you will receive. Forget Comcast or AT&T. You are less than garbage to these people. If you aren't making them commission they don't give a fuck. Tons of associates are standing around, joking, and doing nothing, but you have to stand in line at the help desk manned by one person. And you WILL be going to the help desk, because your order will get damaged, delayed, or sold to someone else. Don't be fooled my the helpful sales associates that greet you at the door. After the sale is made, your living hell begins.
__label__1	Terrible service. Workers don't take tickets in order, and lost several tickets. Continually goofing around while more than 7-8 customers were waiting for more than 10 minutes.
__label__1	Worst place ever not because of food but because of the lackadaisical and unapologetic attitude of the people working there. They stay shut during dinner hours while the hours outside don't say so, then half the menu items aren't even served when they are open. We are not making an effort again to drive up to fishers again for this place.
__label__1	Extremely unprofessional  superentendent  was rude no care for neighbors private property beaches dunes or local ordnances spoke to owner  told me he did not care i  was only unit owner not land owner sux to live in a condo if munyan works there
__label__1	Overpaid for a car wash. Took 30 minutes to make the tube.  After that it sat in the sun for almost 10 minutes before the wipe down began. It looked like the crew were short handed and were more interested in goofing around than cleaning the car. I have come here before and have been pretty satisfied. Apparently they changed the management and the new ones don't seem to be as engaged with the crew. Never again!!  Pay at 2:08 pm. Leave at 3pm.
__label__1	The food and review would be better if the service wasn't incompetent. Regardless of how you order (grubhub or calling) be prepared to wait an additional half hour on top of the wait time you're given.
__label__1	"Writing this to warn people. THIS IS NOT OTTS!!! Absolutely different  ownership and run by people who have no clue what their doing. My wife and I stopped in a few months ago before a local distillery thinking it was an otts. 

It is not. The food they tried to serve us was not edible. Frozen reheated garbage. Drinks poured into dirty glasses. Bartender dressed and looked like she had just gotten out of bed. (She was friendly giver her that). 

We both got sick the next day. Just stay away. This place should be condemned"
__label__1	Bad experience.  The people working seemed wholly uninterested in providing good service.  Honestly, it doesn't seem that hard to read what's on a paper and then put that in a sandwich.  3 of the 4 subs we ordered came wrong, including one not having cheese that we paid extra for.  I was trying to tell the person making the sub to include certain items that she was just ignoring, but she was not interested.  They seem more concerned with getting things done fast (and wrong) than providing any kind of customer service.  And on top of all that, the food is bland.
__label__1	We stopped in there on the way home we've always gone to this Denny's but since they change their menu it wasn't that good the chicken strips were disgusting the manager had an attitude we won't be going back and we will be recommending.If I could give it less than one star I would
__label__1	"Beware! Their waxing room is very unsanitary. They do not use gloves when giving a Brazilian Wax and they use the same wax for all wax services which is just gross. The owner who conducted my wax tried to talk me out of a Brazilian explaining that ""it may be to much for me."" She rushed the service and didn't even wax me completely. I will never come back for a wax. Very disappointing!!!"
__label__1	Tried to place a to-go order twice and died on hold each time. I hung up after 5 min each time.
__label__1	I took my car here to get an ac recharge and an hour later my car was still not blowing cold air. Even the manager kept trying to feel the vent for cold air. I said it didn't work and I'm not happy with the service. He said well I can suck all the Freon back out and not charge you for it. I said I'm not going to wait another hour for that so he took my card to pay for it. Then when he brought my card back he said sarcastically have a nice day. And this is the manager behaving this way!
__label__1	I was a patient here for nearly a decade. I left when I called in with a sore throat and nausea (who wants to operate on a sick person's mouth??), yet they charged me a cancellation fee. They didn't even have the courtesy to ask for a doctor's note or anything. Actually, they didn't even seem to care that I was sick one bit... just that I paid my cancellation fee.
__label__1	service is very poor. I order 8 pc. They only give me 4 pc. I told them but they don't trust me！！！ Thanks Popeyes !!!
__label__1	I hate this place Dump stupid people rotten service I work at Lincoln crossing ofallon il  for now my manager are very nice in ofallon il by Walmart   but of course you going to work with some rude people. It will b OK until I can get a better job y food was amazing.    But.  Carlyle McDonald's is gross. Don't waste your money in. McDonald's on Caryl av by  Belleville East
__label__1	Chase offers to lower interest rates when they hold the morgue but when u call they deny you. Just ask Lauren office number 949542. They have sent three letters and each time denied once we were on the phone due to the type of house. The loan is already through them.
__label__1	A joke. Told me they didn't have a buffer then used one on my mom across the room. Told me they also didn't have cuticle oil but used it on my sisters AND mom. Super rude and treated me like shit.
__label__1	The restaurant was pretty much empty but I had to wait for a while  at the entrance to be seated.  Coffee cup did not get filled and the food was burnt  (potato was literally black, burnt!)  I would not go back for sure.
__label__1	"Terrible, extremely slow service, calamari tasted like a mound of salt had been added to it, pizza was less than stellar.
We will not be coming back"
__label__1	Brought my rotting there for an exam. All the ladies at the groomers love to see him coming cuz he's a big teddy bear. These folks were so freaked at his size they couldn't even manage to weigh him. They showed such fright that they made him and I both nervous wrecks. The tech and the Doc couldn't even manage to look in his ear. I've never seen my dog growl this way. They were happy to charge us for the visit even through nothing could be accomplished. ???   Found another Vet and we're having easy visits...
__label__1	The worst fast food experience. Starting with the drive thru  order. The young lady was rude and rushing me just to get my order completely wrong. I understand it's fast food and you get what you pay for but there should still be professionalism in the workforce. Never going back.
__label__1	After waiting a half hour for a waiter or waitress while everyone around us was served we left.  Even asked the hostess, no acknowledgement from wait staff.
__label__1	idk who the manager is but he is horrible always has been. i placed an order at 8:50 pm i am JUST leaving the parking lot at 10:29, worst managed situation ever i hope they move him around to another chili's somewhere out of state where people dont have stuff to do or where people aren't STARVING. HORRIBLE SERVICE
__label__1	"During the past times I have came to this store , this particularly lady named ""Alejandra"" is very rude to me and always attends me with the most horrible attitude. I m not quiet sure if she's having bad days every time I'm there , but she really shows that she's very disrespectful and rude. I have not complained because the stuff she's said and done to me as A CUSTOMER I COULD get her fired !! Handles this employee ASAP!"
__label__1	Avoid this place like the plague! They seem nice but lie, lie, lie. There is no help with closing out your old carrier, no help with getting rebates and no accurate info about what your bill will be. I had to take them to small claims court to get my rebates. It was a total nightmare! I can't wait to go back to Verizon.
__label__1	It's hard to judge the quality of what's in the casino or resort because it's impossible to find parking anywhere near the facilities. I tried to go there for a corporate event, but the line of vehicles to get in was out to Fifth Street. Every level in the parking garage was full and this was at 11am on a weekday. The other garage was blocked off with explanation or alternate parking info. No signs, no help, and no interest by the management of Ameristar to help customers out with parking. Avoid at all costs!
__label__1	In the middle of a blizzard in Philadelphia standing right where it was ordered.  Looked for a red Keep.  She could not find me.  Tried to rebook and price went to $30 from $12 in a few minutes.  Drivers use GPS and know nothing about localities here and in London.  Fugettaboutit!  Hailed cab... $11!
__label__1	"I stopped by here becuse it was across the street and my brakes were misbehaving. Mike wanted to charge me $500 for pads and shoes. That was not going to happen. $50 parts worth of parts (retail) so $450 for a 1-2 hr. brake job. Silly rabbit; tricks are for kids.  
read and believe the negative reviews on here, I wish I had before wasting my time getting an estimate."
__label__1	This is the worst place I've ever been!!! The service was terrible and the food tasted worse than my ex wife's ass!!!. If you would like to try their food there are some potstickers in the front bushes because I would not disrespect trash by placing their food in the same category. This establishment is a joke and I cannot believe it has been in business as long as it has. I cannot express enough how terrible this place is, save your money, and much more importantly, your time and eat literally anywhere else.
__label__1	"New review 

Got a bunch of techno nerds staying across the street at a hotel
Again we went to the same bar in Reno. Posting this before. 
But there's just this one guy in there his name is Jay or James. Just watching some football with my tribe. Comes up and starts hassling my girls about being 49ers fans. Playing that I'm taking a picture of you with his hands. We had to leave. Better places to have a smoke and drink. BTW bartender Fred was awesome"
__label__1	"This is purely based on a vegetarian review. This place is awful! One of the things I LOVE about Taco Bell is that you can make anything they have vegetarian by adding black or refried beans instead of meat .....

This.. place...cannot handle it. 

Their black beans are watery and bland and completely ruin anything you're ordering. I'm not kidding.

My husband drove 3 miles out of the way to go to another Taco Bell because we didnt want to be mad that we wasted our money on this one."
__label__1	Based on the stellar reviews listed here, I'm guessing that explains why this location has been closed with the building now all boarded up and all signage removed as of June 12, 2019.
__label__1	This place is the WORST!!! Went for a bachelorette party - we found cockroaches, bed bugs, and all sorts of disgust. Hotel claimed they had exterminator come and it wasn't bed bugs but everyone woke up with the bites all over them. They lied to us about the exterminator report and we are now in a war about getting a refund back. I do NOT recommend this hotel even to the filthy animals of the world. Worst hotel and even worse management
__label__1	Wow Ace. I really should've read the reviews first. It would've saved me a ton of hassles, headaches and money if I had just filed my claim myself. Over a year after going through them, still sorting out some oversights with my insurance company. If you didn't want to help me get an accurate claim and an appropriate amount of insurance money you never should've accepted my claim in the first place. Do an about-face if you're considering Ace.
__label__1	Never ever rent from MM Partners. They are absolutely horrible landlords who are just money hungry and do not care about their tenants. They do not maintain the buildings as they should, and never answer the phone. They have treated us horribly and do not deserve to run any business. We will report to the Better Business Bureau as this company is negligent.
__label__1	"I have used Willamette for my dental needs. I received dentures. I was having problems with my bottom dentures and called to get in. They would not make me an appointment. I owed them some money still.  I feel it is wrong to not have seen me. I have been in so much pain. Mouth swollen, blisters and a cut about an inch long , hard to chew and talk.
I want people to know how I was treated
 I do not recommend this place. To much corporate owned for me. Thanks"
__label__1	BEWARE of Dr. Gardner and Grand Dentistry of New Port Richie. He destroyed my mouth! I went there for one tooth ache and they talked me into pulling four teeth (two of which were good!) and making two partials which after several adjustments never fit. They offered to give me a refund of $1,200.00 and after about a year, I just received a check for $53.00! They added insult to the injury they caused.
__label__1	"Walked in for a late lunch/early dinner around 4:45 on a Sunday afternoon. We were seated on the 4th floor and waited over 10 minutes at our table before deciding to leave. Waiters walked around us but not one said ""I'll be right with you"". And when we got up to leave not one person acknowledged us. Not impressed."
__label__1	Since they changed to Spectrum their Customer service it horrible.  I was longer able to get the internet speed I previously had, unless I paid a $199.00 installation fee, all because THEY changed the service!  I canceled them and am now waiting for the refund for services that was to have been here two weeks ago.  I didn't have problems with any of my service (other than the them raising my bill often) when they were Bright House.
__label__1	"Horrible. I used to frequent years ago...food was very disappointing today. I ordered a combo plate. It was just dry ground beef with cheese. Guacamole was tasteless and blended to the consistency of baby food. I asked the waiter for his recommendation...the margarita or the sangria. His response? ""Well, you're the one drinking it,which one do you want?"""
__label__1	Went here on a Thursday night at 6:00 pm and there were a LOT of empty tables and yet the very rude hostess said they were on a 1.5 hour wait. I was a little perplexed. Bar was open but it was packed.  We went next door to Macaroni Grill and got right in. After we finished we went back by this place and there were still a BUNCH of empty tables. This place does not understand reservation management and is obviously poorly managed.  Wow.
__label__1	What a disappointment.  Nobody ask us for help.  Most areas off limits to customer many signs saying employees only.  Closest parking space is for employees not customers.
__label__1	So disappointing! I've experienced two lousy brunches, and I would never go back! There is no treason to wait an hour for cold mediocre food.
__label__1	Very poor service. The waiter didn't really care that our order of chicken wings was 30 mins late. He really didn't care that when they finally brought them they very EXTREMELY spicy...
__label__1	"Tried them twice and was disappointed both times. Food was cold and they completely forgot part of the order both times. I love Japanese food,and ramen and was truly looking forward to this restaurant opening, but unfortunately it has been a let down:(
 Please step it up STL."
__label__1	Ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala, a very standard and popular dish.  It tasted like I was eating spaghetti with overcooked chicken and rice instead of spaghetti noodles.  The sauce was pretty much marinara sauce.  1 start for the very nice and huge naan.
__label__1	The Worst Dinning Ever the waitress Gab got Insulted Because I Complained that I didn't want the chili cheese fries after she put anthor plastic tray on top them and the chili stuck to it then started falling off on the table and Refused to wait on us had to have the manager finish bring the food No one brought the check or drink Refill had to get up and get the check no one would come get it
__label__1	Tasteless and disgusting. The middle of both of the pizzas were warm gooey messes. I couldn't differentiate between the ranch and blue cheese dressings I ordered on the side, both were warm cream in a cup.
__label__1	"Apparently the Optical technicians want you to not touch or try on ""too many glasses"" because they have to sanitize them, and that's just too much trouble. 

I mean how else do you know if they look good? Never buying glasses here."
__label__1	Would not stay here again. Left the Days Hotel due to roaches, arrived here at 3am after calling and being assured that we would be charged one night to stay from 3am until the following morning. Went to bed to be woken up to a check out call. Paid a full nights rate for a 7 hr stay. Poor customer service, and I will be calling corporate about this.
__label__1	Wish I could give zero stars. The poisons used by terminix are known to kill pets and wildlife and destroy our local ecosystem. Not to mention their aggressive sales tactics which include door to door sales. Please don't hire them. There are many natural ways to trap pests, including calling local wildlife organizations who will humanely catch and release at no cost to you.
__label__1	Not at all the great experience I expected. I went in at 1120 am only to be told they open at 1130.. (please note the posted open at 11am).  Then at 1130, I went back in to order my PHO. I was then told there would be a private party there for lunch.  WOULD YOU GO BACK?
__label__1	Service here is awful. I'm pretty sure the people who work here don't actually want to be there. Every time I've stopped in I've felt like I was intruding on them.
__label__1	"Was taken here for my birthday. I did not have to pay for it - but I thought it was way overpriced for what I was served. TINY portions - VERY limited selections - ""cold"" gray decor - no atmosphere - no views. Nothing to recommend."
__label__1	Ordered a specialty wrench thru Amazon Sept 9th. Said item shipped, never received item. Do not order from this company.
__label__1	This hotel was meh at best but I might chalk everything up to the refresh happening soon. Worn out beds (springs poking through the top), broken TV, and drab furnishings. But heck, it's not like I'm living there, I can deal.  But the lack of decent wifi is a killer. I couldn't get onto their network from any of my devices. I ended up at the Starbucks across the street for conference calls.
__label__1	my motor mounts werent replaced correctly i need to spend 1300$ replacing them now when i just spent 700$ a month ago
__label__1	Quite literally the worst most overpriced meal i've ever received. Everything tasted like it was microwaved straight from the freezer. Really wasn't expecting much knowing that its a big chain. Drinks were cheap but tasted as such.  Service was good though
__label__1	"This place is crusty like their Mochi ice cream, but seriously my friend turned 21 today and the end of his birthday was ruined by this restaurant lying to us on the phone saying he would get free birthday sushi and ended up having to pay. 
The sushi was not great and we found bones and paper inside of the sushi and did not get all the sushi we ordered. 
Would not go again."
__label__1	"Terrible service and hidden prices. 
Long waits and rude workers."
__label__1	Absolutely insane covid guidelines,  you'll have workers walk up to you in the middle of a play to tell you to put your mask on while you chew up your 9 dollar bag nachos . Can't even enjoy a game just watch it on TV you won't regret it and save $$$
__label__1	Wegmans Pizza - in a word, gross.  I don't know what is in those pizza ovens but the pizza had an awful smell and taste.  Will never buy pizza from Wegmans, Collegeville, again.
__label__1	Called order in. They said 20 min. Try 40. Got the chicken pizza steak home. Weak is being kind not impressed. Service at the counter. The girl was stoned I think. Had many people waiting and no eye contact had to tell her mutiple times and  still no idea. good luck Pudge's
__label__1	"VERY disappointed that the management would not give us a replacement pizza for an incorrectly made pizza that we were given. Management should make things right for their mistake. 
I will admit their pizzas generally are pretty good."
__label__1	"How do they have even 1 1/2 stars?  This airline nearly destroyed our vacation.  They delayed our flight 4 times then cancelled it.  Then we waited in line for 2 hours to see what we could do next. We ended up requesting a refund and spent $$$ to fly on another airline.  They said my refund will take 5-7 business days to process. Funny it took 2 seconds to take the money out of my account.

I don't know if they only have one plane or what, they said the plane broke down and so they just had to stop flying for the day."
__label__1	"Horrible, horrible, horrible. Been in for a loan twice and both times the guy was very dismissive. 
The guy: Have you ever had a loan?
Me: No. 
The guy: mortgage, car payment???
Me: No. my credit's-
The guy: you're not gonna get approved. 
*walks away*

Apparently, good credit doesn't mean anything there. Arrogant staff. Not very welcoming if you don't have a specific look. I'll never step foot back in that place."
__label__1	I used to order pizza and wings once a  week for the last year. Today I decide to no longer order. Last four or five deliveries have been terrible. Pizza is not cooked all the way. I order 24 wings and I receive 14. I call to order due to technical issues and was charged twice on their website and the employee stated that this happens all the time because the  owner is too cheap. Unfortunate for the fact that I love pizza hut pizza.
__label__1	After a long day of giving COVID vaccines , I ordered a meal . They brought it to the wrong address and never brought my food . Don't waste your time with this place ....
__label__1	It was our 1st time take out order and I am not happy at all.... The dough it taste like not cook, the veges are huge, and the meat and the cheese are not staying together.... They are falling off from the pizza.... Not happy at all.
__label__1	No, No thank you. Comcast is the worst, they charge me too much money and the internet is slow. Then they say they'll send someone but that person never shows up. No thank you.
__label__1	Stay away. Tacky decor. Tasteless food. Cold food. Over priced for the slop they throw on the plate. DONT GO. Will never return.
__label__1	Terrible experience for a restaurant of this caliber. Went before a TPAC show. Bartender was good and drinks OK. Now, we ordered oysters on the half shell. Worst I have ever had, all dried up and tiny tiny. For the price not good. After 45 minutes still no entrees. Finally gave up and left. Manager came over and apologized said that he would send something in the mail. Never heard a word. To many good restaurants in Nashville for other options. Outdated place to go
__label__1	Real bummer.  I went there at 1pm on a Sunday.  The bartender was so busy I almost left because I waited for a while.  I think she had every table around the bar.  I cashed out and walked across to Chilis.  And had a blast!  They need 2 people at the bar.
__label__1	Why are the cashiers so useless and unfriendly? They don't bag your groceries, and they often don't even know where items are even though the space is so small. They don't go out of their way in the slightest to help the customer out. The prices are also just as bad, if not worse than Whole Foods. I'll pass on this place, thanks
__label__1	Went a little while back, there was 1 girl who was super nice taking orders. I paid, and had told her I wanted my cheeseburger with cheese only. A guy goes to the back, and I believe she accidentally forgot to tell him mine was to be plain (accidents happen). I go back and ask for them to correct it, she apologizes, and through the window I can see the guy wipe everything off the sandwich they took back from me and re-wrap it and serve it back to me. Pretty disgusting & unprofessional.
__label__1	Terrible Customer Service, Poor Looking Food, and Dry , Old and Careless Employees playing around stead to fill the line for the customers appetite.... is kinda sad, seems employees don't care about  their jobs, I really like this place but not this location again...
__label__1	"Wow, I tried to come here 4 times. Always a line out the door. I thought this meant it was exceptional?!?!
      Today, I made it in and ordered a small white and 3 wings hot with Cole slaw and beans. Hot flavor was greasy/ spicy and beans were sugary . The Cole slaw had someones hair in it as a bonus flavor enhancer, they were very nice and refunded us, great customer service, BUT-Done.... never again!"
__label__1	Straight Talk is the worst!!!.. Customer service is terrible, I was talking to a customer service person and he told me off and hung up on me... so What recourse do i have.. except to get a new service.  Straight talk used to be the best deal.. but No longer!!!!
__label__1	"Worst experience ever. Was recommended by Hotel as best restaurant around... absolutely the worst. We received the wrong drink to start and waiter said ok and walked away. Didn't offer to get right one. Food was inedible. Has salmon and tuna and neither of us ate more than two bites. Server asked how it was and we told him lackluster and again said ok and walked away. Brought our checks and that was it. No ""I'm sorry"" no ""Can I get you something else"". Do not recommend."
__label__1	"I have had cardboard that is more tender than these 1% (at most) beef burgers. And the fries are awful, cold and greasy. This is seriously mediocre food. 

The only reason people like the place is because it's right on the beach. But unfortunately, like most places right on the beach, especially in tourist destinations, it's horrid. Please do yourself a favor and eat somewhere else in Santa Barbara."
__label__1	"Awful coffee. 

Awful service. 

Awful everything.  

I literally asked the girl for more milk and she gave me an attitude. Are you kidding me?? Wow."
__label__1	Avoid this realty company at all costs! They will nickel and dime you every chance they get. Staff is horrendous and rude. Would never recommend PMG to anyone.
__label__1	In response to Elliott's response...they know me well at the coffee shop.  The negative review was because of your ignoring the situation and being incredibly rude.  Apparently, a lot of others feel the same way.  I hope that changes because your business has great potential.
__label__1	"Let me say this first: I LOVE this place for haircuts! Mini massage, mini facial, excellent styling, all for $18...wonderful!

BUT: beware of the eyebrow waxing services. My fiance and I are 6 days away from engagement pictures, and I could cry over the state of my brows. I clearly communicated (with a photo!) what I wanted, and I feel like my brows were removed rather than cleaned up :'("
__label__1	Ask right away if they take your insurance! Otherwise you will fill out paperwork and sit there until they get around to telling you they don't.
__label__1	"Now I can't remember which nail shop I went to Mr Owner!!!??  A better response as a business owner would have been ""sorry for your experience here at RED CARPET but if you return and speak with me I'm sure we can get an understanding about the pricing.   Doesn't that sound like customer service other than ""you must have the wrong nail shop!!!???"
__label__1	Didn't catch the man's name that came out to do the inspection, but was told they can't resolve the issue and wasn't very friendly about it. I don't recommend this company.
__label__1	Owner and management are completely incompetent. Creepy owner sits at end of the bar hitting on all the women. Stage, lights and sound system is good to bad the old sound engineer sucks. $7 for a half warm skunked beer! Don't waste your time or money here.
__label__1	I was late to work and even came a hour early, had other served when I ordered before. Definitely don't want to come 2 hours before just to get 1 sandwich while others got theirs. Then I get to work and open my food to find molded Cuban toast, your joking right........someone get the owner.
__label__1	The sales representative Tyler Baker was extremely unprofessional. He didn't engage with me or offer me any details about any vehicles on the lot. He didn't even open the driver's side door for me, of the vehicle I was looking to purchase, instead he opened the passenger door. As a sales representative he lost my business, he treated me as if I was a peasant. He didn't have a sales pitch and had an extremely dull personality. I will not recommend this car lot to anyone who is serious about purchasing a vehicle.
__label__1	Not really a fan. Food is kind of trash. A great place to go if you like being talked down to.
__label__1	Communication is extremely poor between front desk staff and any support services (like shuttle service, etc.) Don't assume that the standards you expect or service you receive at other Residence Inn locations will be the same here. I made arrangements for my sister (who has mobility issues) to stay at this location because she has had outstanding experiences at many Residence Inn's across the US. She stayed 2 nights and had unbelievably poor service and I will re-think ever arranging a stay at this level of a Marriott for her again. Consider yourselves warned unless you are self-sufficient and physically able/independent
__label__1	If I could leave 0 stars I would. The service here is beyond slow. Employees do not care about customer service. I've placed 2 orders on the mobile app with my kids in the car to avoid a long wait time and each time I've waited 45+ minutes for TWO DRINKS! I pressed the button multiple times and was promised service that still took forever to deliver. This is unacceptable.  This place needs major work.
__label__1	We used to go to the Big Easy, so we thought we would give Redhound a try. BIG MISTAKE! Food was really terrible. My dish was overcooked, tasteless, watery pasta. My Husband received a well-done steak when he ordered it medium-rare. Service was very slow and waitress seemed flustered. We will never return, in fact I can't think of a nice thing to say about this place, which is sad because I really wanted to like it.
__label__1	the crust is too thick and the sauce is not flavorful at all. It tastes like it came from a bargain can. Most likely I will not be ordering from here again. So much for trying new things
__label__1	ZERO STARS!!! This location was absolutely DEPLORABLE!!! The filth was everywhere. Every table was covered in food, there was trash on the floor, and the condiment and drink station had dirty napkins and trash, not to mention the napkin dispenser was empty. There were 6 people behind the counter and there was only 4 customers in the place including us, so there was no excuse for not cleaning. We were repulsed. I avoided going into the bathroom because of how disgusting the restaurant was.
__label__1	STAY AWAY STAY AWAY STAY AWAY.... WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!!! First,  I am supposed to get full service and I hardly ever get my pool vacuumed the one day I get it actually vacuumed because we were here and he came late Friday, the guy leaves the back wash on and NOW I have no water in my pool almost burned up my pump.   Terrible customer service, terrible service, Terrible --- JUST DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND FIND SOMEONE ELSE WHO CAN AND WILL ACTUALLY SERVICE YOUR POOL AND DO IT RIGHT!
__label__1	The worst fish tacos I have ever had. The taco shells were broken in half. The fish was dry and tasted like old frozen fish sticks. Don't waste your money.
__label__1	"Management changed, hotel quality has gone downhill since. Rates are up quality down - air conditioning and heating barely works. They checked me into the room that was not clean (I stay here almost every week). Moving properties, it's been a good run but new management needs to fix stuff that they broken since taking over the property.



I travel all the time for business and let me tell you this hotel has some of the best staff and service. Lounge is the best one I have been too. Plus a covered garage for free! Like this hotel a LOT!"
__label__1	No never again, the clothes here were not in bad shape but overall I didn't like the style of this place.  That coupled with the incredibly rude staff and the utter chaos of the entire place it really turned me off from coming here again.  Once again wasn't really my style to begin with so I guess it isn't a total loss.  My girlfriend found a lot of clothes she liked though so wasn't a total loss.
__label__1	"I purchased an oil change from Groupon for $25. That sounded like a good deal. I presented the Groupon upon arrival. They charged me an additional $28. They said the Groupon was a gift certificate, so I ended up paying full price anyway. 

Also, they didn't check the air filter because they said it was too hard to access. They did try to sell me overpriced tires when my current tread is clearly above the wear bars. 

I'll find somewhere else to have my oil changed from now on."
__label__1	I wish the food and service was any good compared to the ambiance. First of all they messed up my order by adding sausage to my eggs, when I mentioned not to add them. Secondly the waitress got the order re-done messing up again. Then she started arguing with me on potatoes. Needless to say they didn't have the courtesy to apologize and the waitress Cearra decided to just ignore later. Not gonna reccomend this place to anyone.
__label__1	We went into the bar/ restaurant for a bite to eat after golf. We were ignored by both the bartender and waitress for over 10 minutes. There was no excuse for this as there were only two other tables seated in the room. Finally after getting quite vocal the blonde waitress came over. To top it off the food was just awful. Never again.
__label__1	Staff is slow, there were so many people waiting with 3 staff members that did absolutely nothing. Not sure what they were doing but it's not brain surgery just to do a routine drug test or blood testing. Need to have better management and better communicative staff
__label__1	Fix your freaking brilliant idea of your elevators. I spent more time waiting for elevators or walking up to the 18th than I did in my room.
__label__1	Worst experience that I ever had getting my nails done!!! It was a rude man that did the terrible fill and I was very disappointed with his work and personality. I also felt a lot of pain when he was working on my nails that I never felt before. I will never go back because of his terrible work. I'm so embarrassed by how my nails look!
__label__1	Awful service. Everyone serving ignores you when you walk in. Can't get a drink no matter how long you stand at the bar! A dump with nothing to offer. Saw lots of people walking out after experiencing the same. Guess they make enough money w regulars and don't need new business.
__label__1	They rip you off hardcore. 25$ to get in, 3$ for the coat check, 10$ mix drinks and worst of all I was charged a fee of 8.50 to use the ATM. Also if you have hats you have to leave them at the door. It's pretty lame.
__label__1	Drive up window was difficult. I have been a customer for 25 yrs and never have been given the treatment I was given by this teller. I will never use this branch again.
__label__1	I've lived in Indiana for 5 years, and people have been raving about Yats. I finally tried it today. It was awful. Everything looked like slop, and taste just as bad. Maybe I went on an off day, but I can't imagine they were that off. It took them less than 2 minutes to make my food, which was great. That's about the only good thing I can say about this place.
__label__1	"These guys have a captive audience.   

Last time the sandwich eggs were frozen inside.   
This time went with something no one could mess up...Toasted bagel.   Stale bread and not toasted.  

Line is so long you just deal with it.  

Common Starbucks.  Stop growing and fix your existing stores !!"
__label__1	"This is the company to choose if you don't mind loss of or extensive damage to your items. When I confronted the movers with details of items that were broken and scratched, I was told to call a vast array of supervisor personnel. While I ultimately (4months later) received meager compensation for the damages incurred, I received nothing for the items that they ""lost/misplaced"" in transit. If you select this company for your move, I wish you the best of luck."
__label__1	If you want me to bag my own groceries please open a self checkout line, very interestingly since amazon took over I have not been impressed with the checkout staff, they look like they couldn't care less that I'm standing right there. Last time the guy actually looked away avoiding eye contact while I had to bag my own groceries and no one was behind me in line.
__label__1	Its bad when you don't have the food I order but you can at least say thank you or goodbye when you hang up.
__label__1	I would definitely give this store Zero star, if I could. Woman was very rude, didn't answer any of my questions, and kept looking at me up and down. All I can say good about this store is that it is organized. Will never stop here again or recommend going here to anyone.
__label__1	My wife, who is Vietnamese, and I were in town to visit the beach and decided to grab some lunch beforehand. We came across here on Yelp and Google Reviews and thought it might be worth a try considering it had extremely high ratings. I had Pho Bo Vien and she had banh mi. Unfortunately, neither are authentic. I also had Vietnamese iced coffee was no where near what we're used to at other Vietnamese restaurants and our homemade coffee. I'm sorry but I wouldn't  recommend.
__label__1	"Liberties walk look great, and was a great improvement for the neighborhood.

DO NOT rent an apartment on the walk!!! The management is terrible!!!!!!!! Which is probably why there is such a high turn over rate for the shops below."
__label__1	I literally got a beauty school haircut. A student that was interning was allowed to do my service unsupervised. This is ILLEGAL ($5000 fine). Interns are there to watch and learn, they cannot legally do services. I wanted a lite trim on my shoulder length bob. I lost over 5 inches she cut above my hairline. Everything is choppy and uneven. I wish I could post a picture, it looks like a 5 year old hit me with a weed whacker.
__label__1	One word. ROACHES. I'm typing this as I'm leaving the hotel right now. A roach crawled from under our tv stand and to the corner of our room. Which was the cherry on top of the crumbling ceiling above the bath tub as well as hair in there. If I could give less than a star I would.
__label__1	Don't get their installation!  I'm in the middle of a month long saga to get two simple storm doors. Between the poor training of the door salesperson and the crap contractor they hired to install them, I've been hanging for over a month.
__label__1	My husband was seen twice in the past week at Jefferson Methodist. After his second visit, he was referred to a gastroenterologist and it was listed as an ambulatory (emergency) referral. He was told he has to wait a month to see someone. He has lost weight rapidly, can't keep food down, medication isn't working and he is vomiting several times a day every day. I can't believe they are making him wait an entire month! This is irresponsible!
__label__1	I think this place (Fratelli)  has closed and is now renamed Aqua Vitae or some weird name. Still looks like a dive to me however I have not eaten there since it came under new ownership. The last place was horrible so I have no great expectations for the new place.
__label__1	The service at this place is terrible. They say they have curbside but they dont have it and even asking for it they will say no. Terrible with this Covid times.. they dont enforce social distancing and all tables would be open all together each person. Makes me sick going to this place. Also they increased all prices and food is not same quality you get at expensier places... not coming back :) thanks for saving me a lot of money
__label__1	Pop up Brad Paisley performance on a Sunday- bouncer at the top of the stairs with long beard and glasses was incredibly rude and letting people leave while letting no one else enter. Understandable that it was crowded and could have been a fire violation, but don't treat others differently and make special exceptions for them (which he did multiple times and was probably why they went over capacity, and this was not only noted by myself, but everyone else that was patiently waiting). Terrible experience, which is sad for such a true Nashville establishment. Poor event planning and rude staff.
__label__1	Worst airline on the planet. They give 0 customer care to their customers. They lose your baggage and don't give a blink about it (9 days and counting=holiday ruined). They downgrade your class and not give you a refund for almost 10 months (and counting).
__label__1	Ordered 2 lunch orders of Beef & Broccoli and both had small bugs in them.  See attached photos....
__label__1	"Was waiting to go to this restaurant for a while and was so excited/impressed when we first got there. Told them I had an allergy to gluten and needed everything gluten free. They said that was not a problem as everything they have on the menu could be made gluten free. Get the food and it was so good, ate all of it. Come to find out none of it was gluten free. The waitress ""forgot"". So if you have any allergies, just be aware they might ""forget""."
__label__1	The mimosa's were good, but that's it. The buffet was cold. The service was poor. I saw the hostess giving gift cards to mothers at every table except mine. I was excited to try this spot but I don't plan on returning. $150 wasted
__label__1	Came in tonight, the bar tending staff wouldn't greet my friend and I. We looked for a manager to complain about the negligent service but there wasn't anybody at the host podium. Anyway, if you are thinking about going to the tortilla press, just keep driving and go to the BLUE MONKEY in merchantville, those people do it right, that's what we did, and it was so good, I'll keep it moving every time moving forward now.
__label__1	I am a regular at this restaurant. I go for their rolled kebab and lamb rıbs. I ordered the same last night but our server brought a lamb kebab. When we told her our order was wrong, she did not take responsibility for her mistake. When I wanted my original order, lamb ribs, she said we would have to pay for both orders. (Even though we did not order lamb kebab.) We ended up getting everything in a box and leaving. I specifically go to this restaurant for their lamb ribs, but I was disappointed with the service this time.
__label__1	Flagship Credit promises customer service but their reps are anything other than that. Called in seeing options for billing was told one thing and then another was done and put in place.  Pull the call it will tell the story. Avoid this company at all costs. Ready to turn in vehicle it is that bad.
__label__1	This location had bad customer service. My cousin tried to get cash back and he told him nice try and told him use the ATM...
__label__1	"Terrible unorganized service matched with rude and unprofessional staff.

Response time to inquiries is non existent or takes forever. 

if you're lucky enough to receive a response it is to receive more dazzling excuses as to why they need more time to answer the most basic of questions."
__label__1	Awful, a 1.5 star rating seems justified with the terrible customer service. Staff was very rude and unfriendly. I understand the need to limit people in the store, but you can ask people in a polite way to stand outside in the rain.
__label__1	Mercy Hospital's behavioral unit is abusing my severely autistic son and has threatened me with not being able to see him if I complain about it!
__label__1	I ordered my food and I was supposed to pick it up at 7:55 which I did and I'm still sitting in my car at 8:40 and they came out like 20 minutes ago but it was wrong so we just sat here patiently  so we are getting a free gift card the only thing I'm happy about is that they handled it okay it was a bad day but we will probably be coming back.
__label__1	I placed a 6 pizza order the prior day. Called in the morning to make sure it would be ready at 11:45, I showed up 11:15 to make sure it would be ready. I saw problems on here with delivery, so I chose pick up. It is now 12, not ready and have a class of starving kids waiting for food for limited lunch time. Grrrrr. I am so tired of poor customer service.
__label__1	I and my wife ordered burrito bowl, and the rice and veggies were stale. We both felt sick after partially eating the food and threw most of it in the waste can. I have been a customer for 11 years and am never going back to Baja Fresh. I should have saved the food and shown it to FDA or other agency as evidence. There is no excuse to feed stale food to customers. You are definitely off our list.
__label__1	Drive thru-only extends line even after rush hour blocking entrance to park and pick up. Made the mistake in picking up my drink inside option on the app. Should have ordered from in Target instead next time.
__label__1	"Absolutely awful. Not only did the keep me waiting for 35 minutes for a simple order, they kept saying ""it will be ready in 2 minutes, we're waiting for the hot fries."" Well the fries were cold, along w my undercooked burger and they forgot the hot wings I ordered. Needless to say I won't be coming back again..."
__label__1	Nice location, however right next door to an ice cream store that has AC. Left and went to the spot that had AC in Florida. Sorry but I don't want to sweat while ordering an ice cream INSIDE.
__label__1	Alright, I know this is the budget option for the neighborhood but please (PLEASE) do yourself a favor and spend the extra $50 to stay elsewhere (several excellent options nearby). Society Hill Hotel is not even on the same par as a hostel (ie, no lobby, staff, breakfast, or seemingly much maintenance). This place should be condemned.
__label__1	The hotel states a 3 pm check in. We arrived at 3:45, and we were told no rooms were available for 45 minutes. This is unacceptable. Check in at 4:30??
__label__1	Pricey and not good. Food did not taste fresh and service was a sloppy. The only thing that was super was the water service!
__label__1	"This place owes my son and his girl friend an apology.  They steal my my sons legal ID.  He has to call the police to return it.  The bouncer who stole it, calls his girl friend a Bitch.

What a shameful establishment.  The police gave may son his ID that was essentially stolen. Thank you 

Your establishment needs to think about training your employees.  Calling potential patrons Bitchs is not acceptable.

Happy to talk to owner to remove this if they agree to train their employees not to call young ladies Bitches."
__label__1	Under staffed but staff does not have a clue.  Wander around and miss tables. Meanwhile they do a ton of take out which slows the kitchen response. ( on a Saturday rush)
__label__1	We had heard a lot of great things about this place but ended up seriously disappointed. Chairs cramped, service slow & the food was just gross. I don't know if it was regional or what..I LOVE Mexican food. I have NEVER eaten Mexican I did not like. But both of us were so saddened by the quality of the food, and the flavor of the food. I cannot even remember what they told me I had..it was just nasty..with a pink sauce..who knows!
__label__1	"Service is outrageously bad.   Food was a little less than ok.  Edible.  They forgot to make wife's fish sandwich and when they brought it finally it was under cooked.  Server said it was ""Japanese fluffy fish"" and it was ok 1/2 cooked.  Refused to comp food.  Shinerbock tasted like the keg lines were dirty."
__label__1	Do not waste your money or time, this place has horrible customer service Property Manager is rude along with maintenance. Shelley No need to find out when I was there you should you should remember clearly. There is better places with real professional staff and more security for same price. I will never go back to this place.
__label__1	Normally we have had good  experiences at Home Depot however the last two times we have tried to purchase a gift card on our way out and the gift cards are not stored at the registers nor will the employees assist customers where they are located. Now home depot has lost out business and the $200 we would have gifted.
__label__1	They missed the mark tonight...very poor quality meal. The waffle and fried chicken entree...actually disgusting...and I seldom complain. Under filled and cold waffle ...and over cooked crunchy tenders, that's what passes for fried chicken?
__label__1	Not at all the old dinardos ! The food was so basic ! The flounder taste like it was from a bag ! I don't think I will be returning ! Portions were very small ! Don't think I would go again. Don't waster your money or make sure you have a groupon to help with the bill ! Very disappointed!
__label__1	"5-12-17
***Update*** 
Unbelievable!
This Infusion clinic has over an hour wait, this is an hour after our scheduled appointment time.  
And this is exactly what happened for our last appointment. 

Overbooking isn't a positive selling point for those who have a schedule."
__label__1	Killed my appetite and ruined my mood. Hair came out of my food. Not even 1 piece but 2 pieces of hair came out of the food. I didnt even wanted to eat anything after that.
__label__1	I was extremely disappointed. Not only did I have to wait two hours to place a to go order but my food was cold and extremely little portions. My bill was over 100 which I didn't mind but for the amount of food I did mind.  Also the flavor was not great. My crab cakes had crab shell in between the crab cakes almost broke my Veneers and Crowns. I also had to go back to get an item that was missed  that I purchased nothing was offered as a result not even an apology. I honestly will never eat here again.  Beware!
__label__1	I've had sandwiches from this location several times and would normally give them a two to three star rating for sandwiches that are okay with indifferent service. I thought I'd give them one more try the other day when they offered a customer appreciation day for $1. A sign on the door stated they were not honoring the special with no explanation. This will be my last experience with JJ's...too many other choices in this town.
__label__1	I was here at 9:15 A.M. and they are closed. The sign says 9 A.M. they open. WTF. Help a brother out!!!
__label__1	My family order Pei Wei over the phone from this location and we asked for Ginger Broccoli with beef, extra veggies instead of rice and sauce on the side. We got basically RAW beef and very little broccoli in the entree. Not a pleasant experience for takeout.
__label__1	"I joined back to workout with an old friend. I was told $20 a month and then of course it got hiked up to 44 or so like others. Equipment after years has barely been updated. Management requires thirty days to cancel so I'm being charged $40 more for not letting this empty as hell gym know I was cancelling. The front desk worker did not inform me of this. Predatory contract. POS management. Not worth your time. Put them out of business by going to planet fitness or something.

What a joke of a business model."
__label__1	Terrible customer service experience by both the employees, and the managers. Hurts to see such a great store being so poorly managed. Such a shame!
__label__1	I went into Chico's today. This has been one of my favorite stores for many many years. I don't know what has changed however no one greeted me, no one asked if I needed help and no one even made eye contact. I had money to spend but did not feel like I wanted to spend it there.
__label__1	They have very nice service, very nice. Their food is horrible, especially their hamburgers, they are wet, soggy, moist, and undercooked. I did not like there food at all. After i went here, i went to the Dunkin' Donuts right next door they have way better food.
__label__1	"On a rainy Sunday night I placed a phone order for pick up and I ordered an ASADA Torta & Super Nachos of asada without the pico de Gallo.... 
What was on the torta wasn't asada. Some weird meat. Not satisfying at all (thumbs down)"
__label__1	Went for brunch. It took almost and hour, eggs seemed to be missing in my meal, toast and waffle was soggy. I wanted to love it, had a great dining experience her but will not be back for lunch.
__label__1	"Umm....I ordered 5 different rolls and they all looked the same when they came out. Seriously. Then I saw the waiter put his hands through his hair and then serve food. Also took forever to get waters we ordered and the only thing the waiter seemed to say was ""yeah"". I also saw him touch his nose and face a bunch. Never again."
__label__1	We ordered food Togo. When we were eating, my wife found a cricket! If you order the orange chicken... look through it.
__label__1	Food was good up until new ownership about 4 months ago. Now the quality is going down and food not tasting as good. The customer service is terrible and they seem to consistently over charge despite the fact that their menu clearly states the price and when it's brought to their attention the owner instead of fixing it always wanna argue and debate to justify the up charge with no reasonable explanation. My family or anyone I know will ever patronize that terrible ran business again. My advice is to spend your money elsewhere that has better food qaulity and customer appreciation because you will not get it there.
__label__1	"Terrible customer service, they don't answer their phone & ""reserve the right to stop carry out.""  The last time we attempted to eat here the wait was over 90 min and prior to that the service was terribly slow. I guess when the restaurant choices are so limited and terrible in this area you can do whatever you want. Mediocre food we were willing to give another try but I guess not."
__label__1	Do not order from this establishment.  They do not honor anything if they forget something in your order.  I asked for a small refund and they would not give it to me.  Be aware of this restaurant.
__label__1	Has every waitress called in sick today?  I've had to stop playing twice to go buy my own coffee. Ridiculous. It is never like this!
__label__1	Piece of crap. Just went here and the damn machine didn't even spray soap all over my car. No brushes to even scrub my car. Waste of $10. All did it did was spray a measly amount of soap on my windshield and hood, then half A--ed blow dried it Do NOT go here.
__label__1	"We've been waiting for over 26 minutes and the excuse is they only have 2 cooks.  What? At the dinner hour?
2 specials were ordered and a fish & chips.  How difficult can that be? 
I've been here at far busier times, breakfast, and it wasn't this slow.
The reason is the 'special' Oscar takes 17 min to prepare.  Please.  
If you're searching for a diner, this
Isn't worth the trip!"
__label__1	"Went here on Valentine's Day (our first time) and wished we had a better experience. Atmosphere and food were great, although service was extremely lacking. Our sever Abigail was a bit unsure of various things on the menu, often absent and mixed up our steaks temperatures. When we said something, she simply replied with ""Ok"" and walked away. Our drinks took 15 min every time we ordered. The tables next to us had servers that were often checking on them and we wished we were placed in a different section. Overall it wasn't a good experience."
__label__1	Several mistakes with our order and the service was poor.  Very slow on getting the drinks, bringing the food, checking on table,  etc.  They tried to lie to us and say the crab was in the special, and it was not. Then they came back and admitted it, and took it off the bill when we persisted.  I guess they thought we were from out of town and wouldn't know.  Touristy and not good.
__label__1	My first time traveling to Indianapolis I had a reservation the person that help me didn't know what he has to do totally lost he had to call somebody else to help him the place was dusty they supposed to clean after the customer is horrible service nasty place
__label__1	"This is the worst salon that I have ever encountered. My long time salon of 10 years closed due to the complete renovation of the mall, so I was forced to find another salon to call home. I am a professional woman, so appearance is key. For that cause, I decided that I would give City Nails a try. They are the worst. 

Customer Service = Substandard 
Quality of work = Substandard 
Prices = Reasonable for Center City 

If you are a professional woman STAY AWAY."
__label__1	Service was excellent but twice in a row the food has tasted only of salt. Chicken, ribeye both taste like they were soaking in salt for days. They indicated they can't provide a steak without it. Today was my last time at any Long Horn anywhere.
__label__1	"If I could give zero I would 
Unprofessional al unethical behavior at this location. Refusal to give me my prescription so I could go somewhere else.
Dont think you are saving money because your not and dont ever sign up for any of their bs 
Should have went with my gut when I saw the reviews"
__label__1	"Beware of fake reviews for this restaurant.  I would give 0 star if I had to.  I've been to so many Korean BBQ restaurants, this is the worse of the worse.  $30/ person for cheap meat quality; that's called "" rip off""!!!"
__label__1	Just moved back to the area, went here based on reviews and rather disappointed. Got a gel manicure and a pedicure. The gel polish started fading wasn't the original color I had. I barely used my hands so it does not make sense for the polish to be like this. This started happening 4 days after I got my nails done. Also the technician changed in the middle of getting my pedicure. I would refrain from coming here.
__label__1	This location does not deserve one star. I scheduled an appointment over a month ago. I was greeted by supervisor, Lenora, who provided me with the incorrect number causing the scheduled appointment to be delayed. Of course, this was after I asked the receptionist to speak to a supervisor regarding the delay in my appointment. Lenora expressed total lack of professional and leadership. I did notice a sign in the front door requesting patience as there are new employees with mentors. If Lenora is considered a mentor and/or leader, Pinellas County is in trouble.
__label__1	"Don't go here. 

They could just do better. Even for older women (my mom was shopping there for my wedding) they need nicer sales people. I won't go into details about what they said or how many times they confused me and my sisters unapologetically. But they definitely didn't deserve our money."
__label__1	Still waiting for the rest of my security deposit. After 2 months they sent some of it. They made up charges to keep it after they did inspection and said it was all good in December. Asked to speak to district manager and still waiting since February to talk. Management just straight up lies. Fired old manager and new manager lies too. Go figure. Great business practices. Rent somewhere else. And oh is the back gait still open and waiting for a part?
__label__1	"Recently experienced horrible service from ""parts specialist"" Ted Campbell. Argued with me about what I told him I needed and then threatened to ""throw me out the door"" worst customer service I've ever dealt with."
__label__1	This place is RIDICULOUS!! They were full, except for a table for six. We had a party of four, they had NO ONE waiting, yet REFUSED to seat us!!! And when we asked to speak to the manager/owner, he would not come out! Horrible way to treat people...
__label__1	Food was really good. The service was terrible. The hostess was aloof and snotty. Would not go back because of him.
__label__1	Ordered wings to be delivered. Received 1/3 of the wings . Was charged full price . Wings were okay . Nothing special.
__label__1	They give me the wrong food and after I was trying to explain what happened to the staff they was acting like they don't care. Anyway don't spend money at this location just look at the ratings
__label__1	Wow, so not a friendly welcoming feeling. She was so busy on her phone. We were not welcomed when we walked in or told about anything like specials. My wife asked what flavor were the cakes, no answer. I had to ask for flavors specials. Would I Go back, NO. I get better costumer service at circle k. If I could give a minus star, I would.
__label__1	Honestly the whole Starbucks team in this Target needs to be fired or learn how to be decent people. I've never come across a team so rude. The most unfriendly people I've ever met and they don't really make drinks right. If y'all hate your jobs so much then quit instead of giving your customers a unfriendly and unpleasant experience. I frequent this Starbucks a lot and every single time except maybe once or twice, I've had a pleasant experience. Justin is the only one who is nice to customers.
__label__1	Tried to celebrate St Pats for lunch. No way! My bad idea to try clam chowder first. It was cold and congealed. Gross! Reuben showed up, more fat than corned beef with wrong cold fries. No silverware, no mustard no ketchup for fries. Sorry guys, I don't recommend and I won't be back.
__label__1	Please price check before you get your work done here they charge me $200 more than the dealership would charge made me feel it was urgent when I called to tell them this and gave them a written estimate from the dealership they supposedly talked to the owner and the owner I said I wasn't overcharged so obviously they don't want my business and I'll be going to the dealership because I need the front done also. The Manager did not speak with me professionally raised his voice I was hoping for a resolution but that wasn't going to happen
__label__1	WORST PLACE IN BOISE! Took over an hour just to be given menus. And then another 45 minutes for someone to take our order. Our order got forgotten about. I constantly watched the waiters stack the trays on top of each other, with the bottom of the tray on top of the tacos and served it to customers.  Definitely don't recommend to anyone because of how terrible the service is. 0/5 stars if possible.
__label__1	I was wondering why they were empty and there were lines at all the other restaurants....We came in and found out. Food has no flavor.....service was awful....and we will not return.
__label__1	"I just had the worst service ever by this store. In my opinion it warrants NO stars.
I called and placed an order at 5:50. The order taker was impossible to understand and failed to actually place the order I was told 20 to 40 minutes at 6:50 I called to find out where the order was...... And I had to place the order all over again and wait another 50 minutes for delivery.

Either management needs to get more involved  or they need to REALLY re evaluate the employees or clean house and start from scratch."
__label__1	Yes, you should absolutely explain your pricing before hand. I think that would be a good policy.
__label__1	By and far the worst car was ever. I use the self serve and drive through on the same day with the same car. The only part of my car that is clean is the roof. In the self serve, there was no soap, no water pressure, as well as the other functions not working, all it did was take my money. The drive through is good for the roof of your car only. Vacuumed did work great. I call the telephone number to complained, not even an answering machine. Drive pass this pace and save your money
__label__1	Stay away!!!  Total mess in terms of service .Never used to be this way, I know they'll blame Covid But it goes way beyond that.
__label__1	I just finished shopping a few minutes ago. I have lived many places in the United States being in the Timeshare marketing industry and I can say Burlington is one of my favorite places to shop. NOT HERE! The Burlington here in Brandon is bad. The wait line runs 30 to 45 minutes. The counter staff is afraid to look you in the eye. The management at this store obviously needs to be replaced or some type of higher up needs to come and do some advanced training on customer service.
__label__1	Worst cab company ever call abc taxi. Dony waste your time rude dispatch. Rude drivers. Used them forever till they charged 35 to cancel a cab that never came
__label__1	Absolutely horrible service. I wish there was a rating for 0 stars because that's what this place would earn. Tried to get a late night meal after a night out and we were denied service due to them not accepting a card-when does McDonald's not accept a card!? Asked the representative for her name to report it and she responded that she is the manager and would not offer up her name. Complete joke and would not recommend to anyone! Do the workers play it as a cash deal to line their pockets after a certain hour?? Not pleased the slightest fuck that place. No
__label__1	Update 8/24- went in tonight for my husbands birthday. The food was inedible. Rancid taste in pizza. Tuna in sub was not fresh. Have been seeing a slide in food quality and will not return.
__label__1	"Listen, if you want to walk into a restaurant or ""breakfast boutique"" and wait 30 mins for someone to even speak to you, this is the place you wanna be. The two guys working behind the counter move at a sloths pace and have no ability to multi task. They have absolutely no sense of urgency while working in a restaurant industry. It's just ridiculous."
__label__1	"Please....if you are going to spend you hard earned money....go somewhere else. I just got back from GC and the place was a mess. Not enough food cooked and the food that was served was not cooked enough. The seafood items tasted funny. 

Overall, you get a lot of bad food and very little good. This place looks and tastes like a greyhound bus station cafe. Same clientele, same food, same horrible feeling!"
__label__1	Slowest Wendy's on the planet.  Not so nice rude and just plain nasty smelly and they just can't seem to get the order right
__label__1	"Ordered a chicken caesar salad for lunch - Absolutely horrible!!!! -  Chicken was like old leather - their pizza is just as bad - you've been warned!!!!
* Gave them one star - because you have to rate least 1 star to post a comment."
__label__1	If I could give zero stars I would! We ordered on UberEATS and for $50 we got chicken parm and chicken Marsala. Not even a spoonful of spaghetti, bread or anything with it. $50 for 4 pieces of chicken. Are you kidding me?!?! Will never order from here again. Someone could have called and let us know they are they only restaurant around that doesn't give you pasta or bread with your food. What a joke!
__label__1	poor job, doing rear glass replacement in Note 8. voided warranty as not licensed to do repair by Samsung.  same price as licensed shop. avoid
__label__1	I was astonished by how rude the whole staff was! I've never seen so many sad, snappy, passive aggressive servers working in a restaurant. The food was good but this restaurant is so dirty that it's not funny. This place is overrated
__label__1	It looks healthy and flavorful, but the roast beef was grey and covered in fat.  Likewise, the tomato and basil soup was so rich, it tasted unhealthy.  Lastly, the cookie was terrible.  All in all, I was pretty disappointing in the quality of the food.
__label__1	"When one orders food as part of a group, one does not expect to receive their food a full 10 minutes after everyone else has already received and complained that their food was cold.

""I've had 7-Eleven chicken that was better.""

""I use blueberry for the sausages.""

""I really sad that the boiled broccoli is the best part. ""

""This salad is a dry as it looks.""

My pancakes were flat and flavorless. The French toast was mushy. And they had Enya on the radio, what is this? 1992?"
__label__1	Bad customer service. Unfriendly employment. Very rude, would not recommend to a friend. 10 thumbs down.
__label__1	They stole my dog! Went to pick my dog up and there was a note on the door telling me they are closed due to roads..which are fine!!!! And that they may be closed tomorrow as well!!! No call! No clue if someone is there with my dog!!!! This is criminal!!!! Call me and tell me my dog is being fed!!!!
__label__1	I waited an hour and a half past my appointment time, just to go back and wait an additional 20 minutes to be seen. The front desk staff were rude, and act as if you're inconveniencing them with your presence. There is no professionalism among any of the employees. The place is dirty and has a weird smell. I will never go back there, and I will warn other people to stay far away.
__label__1	"We ordered a couple of delivery pizzas two nights ago. One came raw and inedible. 

We called to complain to the manager and she responded with a thank you and hung up on my wife. I sent an email to dominos yesterday and have not received a response. 

I'm done with this dominos; It's going to be local from now on. At least we can talk to someone who gives a shit if there's a problem."
__label__1	Lobby doors locked at 8pm on a Sunday.  Door says they close at 9pm. 8 cars in drive-thru and nobody moving. Got back in the car and left.  Not worth the stress and disappointment.
__label__1	Won't be back. If it wasn't bad enough that they wanted to charge an extra $1 to substitute carrots for bell peppers in a dish, I ended up getting the WORST stomach ache from the food. **sigh**
__label__1	We want this restaurant to succeed but our experience was so bad we have to say something. It was our first time here and we were shocked at the small portions for such a high price. We had a pasta dish and the Smashburger it took over an hour to get the food.  The service was pathetic and it seemed like there was no manager in charge. Very disappointing because the concept has potential. But for a very small pasta dish and a burger to cost $68 there's no chance this restaurant will make it.
__label__1	"Interested in leasing a home that was listed on the company website. Not wanting to go into a long diatribe - this company is horrible. Had a conversation with Lacie and she was extremely rude to me over the phone. 
A complete waste of my time...."
__label__1	"In different font and I believe italic, they say on their menu that their mozzarella sticks are homemade.  If by homemade, they mean fried there, then yes, they are homemade.  

The chicken cheesesteak was not even a little good and had what can only be described as american cheese sauce instead of cheese.  

I was really hopeful but have been very disappointed."
__label__1	We were trying to eat here and signed up for a waiting list (with 45 minutes of approximate waiting), after 55 minutes they just didn't find us there (in spite of I had a text message, so I definitely was on the list), after some more time they finally find this record, but f didn't change much, we were requested to wait another 30 minutes, so we just hanged out here for an hour for nothing being totally mislead by the stuff, who didn't care much.
__label__1	"Nope. I tried to talk with someone but they kept on saying it was ""connecting"" they do not care. These people are not attorneys."
__label__1	Worst Walgreens ever the manager is rude and dumb my digital coupons would not work and she had an attitude and said that's because your supposed to print them, like I'm stupid I had to explain to her how their app worked and what a digital coupon was I then asked for them to void and redo it and guess what it worked and I didn't have to print my digital coupons. They need customer service lessons and should maybe learn how to use their own app!!!
__label__1	The service is awful! I ordered a pizza with green peppers, onions and olives. I was delivered a pizza with rainbow peppers and mushrooms. When I called to explain that the pizza was incorrect, I was told by an employee that she took the order and she was sure I ordered mushrooms. I explained that I due to an allergy, I did not in fact order mushrooms and an error made by Golden Crust should be corrected.  I'm still waiting on my pizza.
__label__1	Service, food and takeout service has gone way down hill since reopening from fire.  Skip this place, there is way better avaliable close by
__label__1	Went to buy a sportscoat on a Monday that I needed altered and ready to go by Wednesday for a work conference. Was told that was no problem and they measured me, even suggested i go down a size to get a better fit. Went to pick it up and it did not fit AT ALL. They went to get the main tailor and she came out to look then said the jacket was the wrong size to begin with. So now I'm headed out of town without a jacket.
__label__1	"I have been here several times, but will not be going back. We waited for an hour and 20 minutes for our food and the waitress barely apologized or refilled our waters. When my vegetarian plate arrived, it was lukewarm, had flour tortillas instead of corn, and the ""vegetables"" were just green pepper and onions. What a disappointment and waste of $18."
__label__1	First time try this newly open restaurant out. Interior decor wows you but the dim sums are opposite, not fresh, minimal selection and no taste.
__label__1	I love Chipotle. I hate this store. I feel like I am at a middle school lunch line with food being thrown in and no time to think about what I want. I don't need my $8 burrito made in 30 seconds or less I would rather have it made the way I want it and not feel rushed through the line.  The last time I was here I was told by a team member that maybe I should email my 4 burrito order in so that it wasn't so rushed.  Really?
__label__1	"I was in a slow lane with a horrible cashier and asked if another lane could be opened. The cashier got really annoyed at me and started a verbal assault. 
Why should I spend money somewhere I'm berated for asking a simple question? Do not go to Petsmart."
__label__1	I scheduled an appointment for 2 people this morning. About an hour later they called back and asked if we could move our appointment to 30 minutes later than originally scheduled. I said fine.  We arrived about 5 minutes before the rescheduled time. When it was our scheduled appointment time I asked when they would be getting to us.  They said it will be another 20 minutes.  I left and will never go back.  You can't reschedule a customers appointment and then think it's OK to ask them to wait 20 minutes past that time.  Their are plenty of other places that will provide you with better service.
__label__1	I normally shop at the Lowe's in Brookhaven,because of there excellent associates and customer service. Today I was in the neighborhood, so I stopped at the Lowe's in Havertown. Boy, could Ruth in customer service learn from her brethren at Brookhaven. Thank goodness for the other associate at the counter, who finally handled my issue.
__label__1	"The food here is good, but the service is awful. Servers and bartenders are completely inattentive and the food consistently takes far too long to long to come out.  

I live a block away and have been here many times, always hoping for a better experience. But it's always the same story: the bartenders much prefer to stand and talk to the off-shift employees drinking rather than take care of paying customers. 

Train your staffer better or you'll lose more customers. You've lost me -- I won't be back."
__label__1	Horrible service... it was a hot mess. They got multiple peoples orders wrong and was extremely unorganized. I ordered the pumpkin latte and it was so sweet I literally could not drink it. Felt like I was drinking straight syrup. Wasted money on coffee that should be pretty standard... it's a franchised Dunkin' Donuts for peeps sake.
__label__1	The owner should be inside this location daily or possibly consider closing this location, very unorganized, 2 different occasions not one person in the stores acknowledged I was even at the order counter during lunch service.
__label__1	The owner and management staff are Terrible...The doorman is a Real Cutie, but everyone else can Kick Rocks on a Hot Sunny Day in Open Toe Sandals. The blatant disrespect from the owner was very on called for, he tried his best to ruin our night but the devil was a Lie...Anyway in conclusion we will never go back. Now, I might drive by to see the doorman but that's it.
__label__1	Reading the reviews would have been helpful...I see cancelling appointments last minute is what they do...We had an appointment on the schedule for over a month and they just cancelled the day before.  Not a good look.
__label__1	I regretted my decision to get takeout from this establishment as soon as I walked in and seen people were smoking everywhere. Yuck, nasty!!
__label__1	"Wear your mask, even if vaccinated... lost my business...

Get on with the times... hopefully people boycott this business"
__label__1	This place is terrible. The manager (I suppose) spends his whole time yelling at most people. There are select few that he let's do whatever they want including shoot during breaks in the middle of other team practices and games. He is definitely a jackass.
__label__1	I'm a driver for Lyft this company is only out to make money they don't really consider the passenger and they certainly don't consider the driver.
__label__1	Kind of annoyed. When a restaurant has posted hours, they should actually be open during that time. It's a good thing that I thought to check while we were driving over because the last time we tried to have a kosher meal in Tucson, they were closed. Today, they actually answered their phone and said that they closed early because business was slow.
__label__1	"This store is so terrible It is unbelievably messy,
Unorganized and dirty. I am literally embarrassed for the  store Merchandise is terrible . At least half of the stuff  in the store doesn't even have prices labeled Even like the end caps displaying new merchandise 
Look messy and have no prices like at all. I couldn't even look at the shoes because they were literally  just
Heaped on the shelves with no organization, no display shoes to see what you're looking at. Walmart and Ross have become better than target. Also management is super disrespectful"
__label__1	Not a great experience, went there as a suggested second choice on labor day.  The service was lousy.  None of the servers there seemed to know what they were doing or much about the menu items.  There were approximately 5 other tables being waited on by 3 different servers and it still took an hour to get our food.  I am assuming this was because they had to come back to our table on 4 occasions to tell us what we thought we were ordering was not really available to us.  Although the food was priced relatively cheap, I will never return to this restraunt.
__label__1	Probably won't make a difference but their pricing is super grimy.and they nickel.and dime everything. They change rules or don't.communicate how different options impact your meal. I wish they would close down but not likely
__label__1	I wish I could give this place 5 stars because the food is NOT the problem. The staff is horrible! I think management needs to change. The poor staff is young and inexperienced. They are friendly but overwhelmed with the volume of patrons. Wait time just to be seated is bad but once you do get your food (after maybe 30 min after ordering and 30 min of actually waiting for someone to simply TAKE your order) it's delicious.
__label__1	I'm not sure how hardcore of a thrifter you have to be to thrift here, but if you imagine the house from Grey Gardens mixed with urine stained mattresses and single shoes, you pretty much got the picture. Horrifying.
__label__1	"I went to this resturant location  about a week ago and order to my avail the restroom is always out of order.

For paying customer not cool.
So if you pay your money don't bother asking to use the ."
__label__1	"Wow. Sat down, got menu, then waited 12 minutes before leaving. Didn't get to order drinks, ask any questions, nothing. 

Maybe they are extremely short staffed?"
__label__1	I had a buffalo chicken salad delivered. It was literally a handful of soggy, old, and weird smelling lettuce. I called and spoke with the manager who told me she was too busy to deal with me right now but took my phone number and she'd give me a call back later today or tomorrow. Even if she does call back, I still have nothing for dinner and paid $17 for a few pieces of chopped up buffalo chicken. I'm unsure which is worse. The food or the customer service.
__label__1	This review goes to the owner of the establishment your Cooks are going to run your business in the ground I purchase an order from the Girard Avenue store and the macaroni and cheese was terrible the noodles were mushy and I'm talkin about very very mushy to where as though I could have ordered some mashed potatoes I have never ate and over cooked noodle like thisin my life advice to whoever the owner is you need to check on your Cooks because this is unacceptable and it will run your business in the ground
__label__1	I just went through the drive through at 11:10 am on Friday, November 16.  All I wanted was a beefy five later burrito. It took me over 30 minutes to get through the drive thru with only 2 cars in front of me. By the time I returned home (I live less than a mile from this location) my burrito was cold on the inside with a hard dried out tortilla. I won't be visiting this location again, and suggest you do not as well.
__label__1	Watch several employees eating and then prepared food without washing there hands air changing gloves. Lobby is dirty and bathroom needs attention. Won't come back to this location
__label__1	"Terrible , Terrible,  Terrible 
First the servers as its a cafeteria style restaurant did not know there ass from pinto beans
Out of mashed potatoes,  out of fried pork chops , out of fried squash
If you can wait 40 minute's will fix you some ....my ass...
Then the server is so worried about my ticket ...she gives me 2 both wrong
I go to pay and tell the cashier and I promise you ...she could care less
I will never go inside this place again"
__label__1	Online it said they are open until 10pm another place online says 2am they would not  let me in to grab a head of lettuce!!! So lame. This store is dirty and has NASTY customer service!! Discusting store and obviously the company does not care!! YUCK YUCK YUCK!! Skip this gross establiahment if you can!!
__label__1	This is the worst restaurant I've ever been to. The service is slow. It was empty and we waited 20 minutes for milk for my kids.  When we walked out before the waiter brought the drinks the manager had the nerve to say some nasty things to my wife. Never go here.
__label__1	Horrible business and terrible management. All you have to do is a quick search on Reddit for the proof!
__label__1	25+ mins to wait then it's slow (2customers) is unsat.  Managing the two other people standing around can easily help this situation. Walked in at the time you all told me it would be done and you didn't place the burgers on the grill for another 3 mins.
__label__1	I'm here now, seat yourself seating not too bad only 5 min to get a seat. Buuuttt I've been waiting 35 min to be noticed by wait staff and still waiting. Definitely long enough that I am completely ready to order. Definitely a stark difference from my last visit a couple of yrs ago. Only an hour to get waited on, hopefully the food is as good as I remember.
__label__1	Horrible service here. One employee named COURTNEY was extremely rude to me, I as shocked. Never has anyone, especially a business professional, spoken down to me as this woman has. Shame on her and shame on United Airlines for allowing it.
__label__1	"Stopped by this local watering hole in NOLA - good jukebox & friendly locals.  BUT the grouchy guy behind the bar really was a buzz kill. Especially when we were told "" he's the owner"" Had to leave after we watched his terrible behavior towards his staff. So many other choices in New Orleans...."
__label__1	I had the catfish and wing combo and oh my that food had me sick as a dog.  Vomiting and diarrhea.  Never again
__label__1	I have gone into the bar on three different occasions: first on own, second to meet friends in room on other side, third with eight other women for a celebration.  Each time any acknowledgement I received was not welcoming nor timely (the third time my friends felt the same way).  I indicated such to them while there, as well as on Facebook in which they were tagged...no response.  Will never go back.
__label__1	This was the dirtiest McDonald's I have ever been in. The soda station was full of fruit flies from spilled sugary soda. The ice tea containers looked like they had not seen a cloth in years. I literally did not eat my food as the flies sceeved me out. The ketchup dispenser was disgusting. This location seriously needs a power wash and a thorough clean. The manager was to busy talking on his phone and discussing mangos. I for one will never go back here.
__label__1	I called ahead of time, they told me if I got there before closing they would see my daughter who had burns. I got there 4 minutes ahead of time and the nurse was so rude and said the doctor left. I said I just spoke with you a few minutes ago and you said the doctor would see her. She was extremely rude and it was an awful experience
__label__1	"I just put in a claim for my 3 leather love seats that r all motorized
Leather is cracking on 2 of the love seats
3rd is perfect
Sent pics 
Now waiting on corporate office to reply
Hopefully I can make this into a good and positive review
I bought these at the Brandon Florida store and was told they do not use that manufacturer any more
Will
Keep everyone posted 
Hopefully I will change to 5 stars"
__label__1	While their food is quite good, the staff are incredibly rude. We were pushed out because we were not ordering fast enough. The staff were mean and hostile. If you're looking for a nice relaxing meal, do not go to Frieda--you'll be treated like an inconvenience.
__label__1	This location is very bad!!! I ordered a lunch special they got it wrong and the cook I guess manager told me I had to take it. I had to continue to ask for a refund after he told me I was going to just keep the pizza. Very rude and they food is horrible.
__label__1	Will not accommodate even minor order changes, even something as simple as being able to get 4 shrimp on an appetizer that comes with 3 (was willing to pay extra, and wanted it because we had 4 ppl in our party). Got the pork chop and it was very dry.
__label__1	"I do not do this often. But this called for it. In 15 minutes time waiting for my food, I watched them drop a spatula, pick it right back up and continue using it. Then got someone else's food, in which I opened and touched. I took it in to get my food, and watched the man take it out of the foil, and re wrap and re label it. 

Didn't want to believe all the gross stories were true... guess they are."
__label__1	They were very slow with service and there was a misunderstanding and the bouncer pulled a knife on me and my friends. Please share this
__label__1	This Is my second time writing a review on this place for the first time I didn't even get a response from anybody. I gave it a three before But now my heel is getting worse, it looks infected and I can hardly walk. I hope to drive there tomorrow to talk to the manager or owner about this issue. They do need to be careful, they are dealing with a very crucial part of the body, our feet or hands.
__label__1	"I am so angry; I stopped in for an oil change. I was asked if I was having any other problems like squeaky brakes and I said no. Less than 21k miles. He said they would look it over and came back with a 'brakes ok' just needed a couple of filters. WHOA left and brakes SQUEAK BIG time!
Don't know what they did but will not trust them again."
__label__1	Went to watch a football game with some friends. We sat at the bar and the bartenders were too busy standing around. Took a long time to get a drink and we asked for food menus but never received them. Terrible customer service
__label__1	Food was ok but they need to work on customer service.  Waiting too long for food and waitress need to work with just tell the truth about people's orders instead of making up story's.
__label__1	I have been attempting to coordinate a repair and the customer service department is absolutely horrible.  They take their time to respond to emails after giving a quote.  When I call and they don't like that I am frustrated with them, they hang up and the manager says I have to be professional.  Then they give an excuse they are extremely short staff and are dealing with not getting product in.  At the end of the day, I am sorry you are dealing with all of that, however it is not my fault and your current employees shouldn't be treating the potential customers like crap.
__label__1	Wow. If i good give a negative review I would!  I have ordered from them a few times and gave them the benefit of the doubt.  Dry hard old disgusting pizza.  No one will deliver to doorstep.  They call and want you to come out to them to pick it up.  Food was cold every time, nasty and all of my boxes were smashed?  How do you smash a box for every item I ordered.  This is the absolute worst pizza especially for a chain...NEVER order from there, they will only rip you off every time. Go to dominos or pointers pizza!
__label__1	I walked into this store on a Monday and they rudely kicked me out because they said they were closed but there signage said they were open for another hour. They seemed to have cute clothes but rude staff
__label__1	"I am very sorry to write this bad review. I have ordered . Fettuccine ALFREDO  pasta and sauce was unbelievably bad .it tasted like they brought past sauce from ShopRite and mixed with frozen pasta. The reason i am really upset with them is i have called romanza and told them with very first sentence that i am not calling you to get anything free from you . after listening to my complain the guys started saying something in Italian and then his response was "" Is their any other complains ?"" before even I say something he just hang up. GREAT WAY TO DO BUSINESS ."
__label__1	"I am still in pain.  The massage was rough, like hitting rough, and when I continually said ""ouch"", you are hurting me, she continued to do a hitting motion.  I thought yelling ""ouch"" in the middle of a massage would get my point across, but I guessed not.  I finally had to get up and walk out.  Save your body from the abuse and go somewhere else."
__label__1	Terrible drs. now seeing all the poor reviews, I realize I don't even have to go into detail about how horrendous this practice is.
__label__1	They overcharged my friend and I by over 15 dollars. The bill only shows the total amount so when we asked the waitress to see each item she said she couldn't change it because there was no manager on. (It was a Saturday night). She proceeded to give us cash - but not enough. We both lost money. I will never go back because the good and drinks were not even that good. I can't stand businesses that just take your money and give no explanation. DO NOT GO HERE BECAUSE THEY OVERCHARGE YOU.
__label__1	I have tried to use them but they're not customer oriented at all. I've had much better luck at American Outdoor Power. AOP gives you a free estimate prior to starting a repair and they give you the old parts when they're done so you have proof the parts were replaced.
__label__1	My husband and I are new to area and both our vehicles needed tires.  We dropped off one car which took 3 hours then we dropped off the truck.  We decided to wait because a snow storm was happening.  We waited 4 hours and their staff was leaving because of the storm...Hello?  I dont recommend them. They are too slow.
__label__1	This place is absolutely disgusting. I would break this place into three parts, the first part smells like a sweaty armpit, the second part smells like poop, and the third part smells like pee. There's a bunch of homeless people and people asking for money. I went at around midnight so maybe that affected my experience. I will never come back to this place.
__label__1	"If you're going in as a dancer, beware of the pocket watching woman that sits in the dressing room. She calls her self a manager (along with the rest of the staff) and demands a $10 tip for doing absolutely nothing. And when you had a bad night and made all your money at once, and you don't feel like you'll be able to afford her random tip out, she will demand ""her money"" aggressively and threaten that you will never be allowed back unless you offer it up. This is all after you already paid your $40 house fee."
__label__1	"Mail is rarely delivered to my Metairie home, when I'm just blocks from the post office.

I have informed delivery. I can see what I'm SUPPOSED to be receiving.

Appalled that people still support the USPS and their criminal ways. Private sector will eat you alive soon.

I'm over it. Absolutely over it."
__label__1	When the place is not cleaned properly and they switched the blame on us that we didn't tell them to clean the sink specifically when I asked them to clean the bathroom! Also broke things in my house and didn't tell us.
__label__1	"I really wanted to like this place. Unfortunately for me I tried to have dinner delivered. After an hour and 10 minutes of waiting a person from the restaurant called to tell me that they didn't have a driver tonight so they can't fulfill the order. A whole hour to figure out they didn't have a driver? 

I don't buy it. I think they forgot about it and came up with some lame excuse. Oh well I won't try again ."
__label__1	Easily the worst restaurant I've been to in Tucson. Have they ever been inspected by the health department? I was in there for ten minutes and noticed at least 5 violations out in the open. The service was ATROCIOUS but the food was decent...probably saved by the fact that I was starving. I would never go back, even if I was literally dying of starvation.
__label__1	Put on hold 3 times waited over 15 minutes for the representative to come back but never did. wasted over an hour of my time. going to need medication for the stress and irritation they have caused. I will continue to pay extra and pick up my prescriptions at the local pharmacy
__label__1	What a shame, this location was one of the bright spots in north county fast food for some time.  It seems that they have regressed to the mean.  The food now is stale, over or under cooked and the fries are the cold, soggy mess you'd expect in the area.  Forget about ordering anything the way you want it, you won't get it. And, of course, the service is surly and rude, as if your absurd request that they do their job is an imposition and a favor they're doing you.
__label__1	Had a chorizo burrito delivered just now.  It was cold right through, which means that it is old.   I had to throw it away as I couldn't trust it. Don't eat here!
__label__1	This is the WORST post office ever. From the mailmen leaving the community mailboxes open and not locking them back to them consistently losing your packages. It never fails. 3 years now and it's still a horrible experience with them. Complain to the manager for her to nonchalant. Throw the whole post office away and start from scratch .
__label__1	I've rated this place a 1 star due to their horrible sides it's 2020 you should always be implementing in flavor and well cooked food . Their baked MAC was served to me OVERCOOKED it was disgusting!!!! Their Yams DIsgusting!!! I'm here writing this to save y'all money !! They need to work on their recipes!!!!!
__label__1	Ordered curry goat and it was absolutely disgusting!! I am Jamaican born and bred but you don't have to be from Jamaica to know good curry goat.  I paid for the meal which she asked me how it was , I replied disgusting , no flavor and she said well people cook curry different. Well I have no problem with Indian ,Trini curry and I know what Jamaican curry is suppose to taste like. If your starving for Jamaican good ,cook your own .... It's that bad!
__label__1	"I like pho, and it's very tasty here. But I came in by myself and was seated by who I am assuming was the owner and, upon seating me, he told me ""next time you bring another person with you, that way I make more money."" You don't say that to a single woman who just wants some pho, and the restaurant was mostly empty, so it's not like I was wasting a table or anything. Very rude and made me really upset."
__label__1	"I can't believe that we didn't have the same experience some of the other diners had.   We ordered eggplant rollatini, it was dry and tasteless, branzino tasted old and flavorless, grilled octopus was nothing special.  My dinner of lobster raviolis were so salty,  it was impossible to enjoy.   Maybe we ordered all of the wrong things, but what we ordered are so simple to cook.
So if you know how to cook yourself and dine out a lot, you shouldn't eat here."
__label__1	This place was horrible on service the waitress was making fun of a non english speaking group. The food took way too long and they did not have half of the things on their menu. When we got home after eating my stomach hurt so bad. I had to go to the doctor. Food poisoning. WORST PLACE EVER.
__label__1	Waited 45 minutes at the drive thru, surely employees, and overall poor service. I would suggest eating in if your gunna go here ‍
__label__1	We ordered a medium-well burger but instead received a cold, rare and bloody burger! We also ordered a vegetarian croquet but it came very cold and and tasted like it had been sitting out for a while. As a Penn alum and a frequent visitor to University City, I just cannot recommend this restaurant!
__label__1	I'm ticked off because the dinning room being closed is extremely inconvenient! I went to the door because I didn't know, I was told I have to go through the drive thru and I said I didn't have a car and I was told I would have to do curbside than. I waited standing in a parking spot in the pouring rain for 10 minutes! My food was practically cold and I got no utensils for my Mac & cheese.
__label__1	Was much sorer after all 3 of my adjustments and had a major headache..that never happened to me with other Chiropractors, and I have been getting Chiropractic care for 25 years! Will not be going back!
__label__1	Either the ovens are not hot enough or they're not leaving the pizzas in long enough. Been there two times in a week and both times pizza dough is not fully cooked. Did complain to them they gave us a credit. Came back same thing pizza not fully cooked you could still see the individual cheeses because they had not fully melted.
__label__1	Horrible food! The service was very slow even though we were the only ones there. Came here because we heard the good reviews. Wouldn't ever come back again!!! The bhel was too sweet, the samosa chat tasted weird and the dhaba chicken should be called spineless chicken.
__label__1	"I bit into a chicken wing only to find it not fully cooked. Ick. The only time the waitress came to check on us I told her that the wings weren't fully cooked and we were done with them, she said ""oh some people just don't like how we cook wings here"" and walked away, leaving the wings on the table."
__label__1	Customer service sucks! Had to take my sick husband twice to St. Joseph after being seen by advent hospital
__label__1	"I just watched a TABLE screwed to the wall 
FALL on top of a couple who then WERE AVOIDED BY THE OWNER (yes, we ALL SAW you peek your head in the back entrance, and SCURRY AWAY like a scared little cockroach)
And
Wrong toast 
No coffee
No lemon
No cheese on omelette 

That was just my meal- not even mentioning the accompanying diners' issues."
__label__1	"TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!! Waited in line for 10 minutes at the drive through at 6:50pm, well before closing, and literally as soon as we pulled up to the speaker we were told that they had closed early for a ""staff meeting"". And because we were stuck between cars we had to wait another 10 for the people in front of us to get their orders before we could get out of line.  No apologies from the staff."
__label__1	Paying in insane amount for rent you'd think you'd get an amenity like DECENT parking but it's terrible. Not a single place to park sometimes you have to go out and park and the school across the road and if you have a visitor that's coming and they don't have their visitor's pass on their dash, they get a boot. 5 times we've gotten a boot on either our or a friend's car. Sometimes even just for not filling out the note all the way. It's ridiculous here, would think twice about it 100%.
__label__1	It's Not Professional To Throw Utensils & Condiments In ToGo Orders With Attitude. Will Not Eat Here Again. AJ
__label__1	Sorry but I normally do not give reviews but my husband and I were very disappointed with the food and the service.  Will not return.
__label__1	I've seen this place steadily decline in quality of food and service...it's not a friendly place by any means and you often feel like your interrupting the bartenders social time! I've been going off and on for a couple years but I will not be back.
__label__1	If I could give no stars I would.  If you want poor customer service and your order to come inconsistently wrong use Postmates.  If you want everything to come in as ordered, go to literally anyone else.
__label__1	Taco Bell is usually pretty good, but this location in particular is discussing! The kitchen has food and trash all over the floor, the team does not operate well in stressful hours and they screwed up my order I would have had them fix it but they already had a crap ton on theirs hands so it wasn't worth my time. My advice go to a different location for better service.
__label__1	Horrible call center. I called to have a refrigerator removed from the third story and explained to the call center to make sure they bring 3-4 guys to lift it, because it's very heavy and difficult. Of course, they show up with only two people. After I stressed 6 times to send 3-4 people. They were not able to remove it. And was told they would not make another trip with more people. The guys that did show up were very nice, but couldn't help me. Very disappointed.
__label__1	I ordered take out and honestly it was a waste of money. The $10 salad barely covered a plate, there was no dressing. The large soup was twice as much as the small and the container was only half full. The only things inside their Tom Kha were a handful of enoki mushrooms and some bland boiled chicken. How do you manage to mess up edamame with salt?! Edamame had not any salt on it. Will not be ordering or eating here again. HARD PASS.
__label__1	Pretty terrible when a place calls your job to complain about you because of a review you put on them? They will not give a refund even if within their own guidelines.  Do not prepay for an event as they will not let you cancel. After asking several times and placing a review this place steps to an all new level of low.... They did this to one of the sweetest people I know!
__label__1	I'm just going to pile on here.  Came in at 2PM to get an international drivers license.  Multiple people were sitting around talking about cats while one person was desperately trying to figure out how to use the computer.  If you need something from this location pack a lunch and plan to be there for the entire day.
__label__1	We went to have dinner last Friday night what a huge disappointment after reading so many positive reviews.  My dinner was not even worthy of one star it was  tasteless!  The service was horrible we waited forever for our food to come!  The restaurant was so loud you could not even carry on a conversation...save your hard earned money eat some where else!
__label__1	I did not end up hiring Olga's service. On walk through of the house, I found her a bit pushy and in my new house she didn't want to take off her shoes. I may have been mistaken but I think she was going to use my kitchen sink sponge to clean the kitchen. I had a hard time pinning down what supplies she was going to use and the was a huge jump in price for her company to supply cleaning supplies.
__label__1	"Arrived today.  No shuttle because ""drivers not available"".  Head up to room, try to get a shower.  Out of luck: no hot water and unable to take a hot shower.

Advertised feature not available and a hygiene factor down.  Sounds like a bad motel on the road, not a ""Sheraton"""
__label__1	"The food was terrible and over priced. The French dip looked like Alpo instead of an au jus. My friend sent back her crab cake. It was served over lima beans, really?  And the crab tasted funky.  The tomato ""salad"" was not a salad, no lettuce. $10 for a few slices of tomatoes with a few chunks of mozzarella.  There only good thing was the cheats cheesecake. The staff was good. There bar was busy but the dining room was empty. Really odd on a Friday night.  Can't believe they had such good ratings."
__label__1	If you like limited Breakfast   Items at 0430 am this is the place. I went in there I was told I can have Biscuit 'N' Gravy or BLT not much to pick. Yes there 24 hour but not there food.
__label__1	"TD Bank is hands down the worst bank! Especially their ""customer service"" department is a total joke. Even when they realize that they ere completely at fault they refuse to actually do anything to resolve a situation for a customer. Do yourself a favor and take your business elsewhere - these people are the worst in the business and do not deserve the business that they currently have - TD BANK IS JOKE!!!"
__label__1	Just got take out to take to hospital for ill relative. Food was not edible. Everything was cold. Packed 6oz sodas with straws & we didn't know it. They spilled all over & they $2.75 each. It's too late to take back. We will never go again.
__label__1	"Stayed 30mins and left after I ate. 
Food was fine but the person that took our order was terrible. It was as if he didn't want to talk to me at all very rude. I didn't see anyone walking around wiping down annyyyy of the games. Just didn't feel safe or clean. One of the staff at the front counter was nice that's about it. No me gusta"
__label__1	Horrible experience, stay away, always delayed my installation and tried to rip me off for extra money, total thieves!!'
__label__1	"Officious and bureaucratic .

Do not call United Airlines before 5 am.  You will be connected to the most officious, rude, bureaucratic people United could possibly find to hire in India and the Philippines. They will give you completely different information than you will get from a US based agent."
__label__1	Stopped here while on vacation. Was charged $70 for a dip set, which seems outrageous to me. That alone would not have caused me to leave a bad review, but 5 days after my $70 manicure, they chipped very bad. Do not recommend coming here at all.
__label__1	Been here alot of time, this time service was awful the waitress (Ali S) was terrible. She couldn't remember orders, and told me i was lying about what i order, called  for the manager who was no help @ all. Avoid Ali S, when you go to this establishment.
__label__1	Pretty terrible ordering experience. Yikes. Hopefully the pizza is far better than the service.
__label__1	I wanna give yall cowards a BIG FUCK YOU for assaulting a VISIBLY handicapped man. That was the most cowardly thing you can possibly do it's basically assaulting a child!
__label__1	The bakery cookies are not fraiche. I got a carrot cake that was waaaaay expansive and I can tell it was frozen. Plus the coffee is just water you don't get the taste of coffee. When u try to return it back for a good one. They will argue with u that nothing is wrong with it. Luckely another customer inquired about the same issue I have....pricey and not good quality bakery.
__label__1	"Because I don't consume dairy order a no cheese pizza. The pizza was burnt so bad it was only edible in the middle. Called and complained heard cook in the back saying something along the lines that's what happens without cheese. Really, ""Einstein"" maybe a few less minutes in the pizza oven?"
__label__1	A very busy post office, two windows and very slow service. Not a fan, but semi-convenient for the students. I usually just brought my packages at all better hours to the big post office at 30th St. instead.
__label__1	"I recently had this company seal our pool area pavers in Starkey Ranch.  We have one of their employees on our security camera, urinating into our pool.  My wife wants to drain the pool and replace the water.  I really am at a loss for words.  The actual job was subpar, the surface wasn't prepped properly and now we have a white cloudy film on the pavers.  I now have to pay another contractor to fix the work.  Upsetting, to say the least...
Try Duragaurd Paver Sealing, they fixed the horrible work that I was left with."
__label__1	"Sorry..gave it a try but...they don't have their stuff together ..and probably have fresh out of school massage therapists working here. And your 1 hour massage is actually 50 minutes . 5 mins changing and 5 mins talking ..was stressful. 
Masseuse kept massaging against the muscle..that can seriously hurt you. Bad experience."
__label__1	This company is terrible. They nickel and dime you every chance they get, are slow to respond to maintenance calls, have inconvenient hours and are generally unhelpful to their tenants. I would avoid leasing with them if you can help it.
__label__1	"I had a reservation made for early December 2016 (I made it in October) and I showed up and the place was CLOSED!!  With a chainlink fence in front.  I called the main Ramada phone number and they didn't even know it was closed!

I had to stay across the street (which was actually very nice) at the Comfort Inn.  The staff there told me that the Ramada just up and left a few days before and it is being turned into a ""treatment center."""
__label__1	When upon entering the establishment, we were not informed that the credit card machine was not working and were not told until after we had finished eating. We did not have enough cash so it was requested for us to send the money through Venmo to the waitress in order to pay bill and since I did not have Venmo, I was given the option to write down my credit card information on the receipt for them to use when the machine was up and running again. Very disappointed with the unprofessionalism.
__label__1	The restaurant was extremely dirty. All the tables and the floor were disgusting. Two workers walked through the restaurant and didn't even seem to mind the mess. There was one person in front of us and our order took over 10 minutes. The worst!
__label__1	"We are members at this cigar bar. We came
Down here for a drink and great music. Well there was a Christmas party outside the cigar bar and slowly it made it into the cigar bar. The people were super loud and getting into personal space. It was uncomfortable, what am I paying money for?!? If I wanted a place with loud atmosphere I could have gotten that for free."
__label__1	Job was scheduled to be completed in 2021, not started until 2022. Champion has made several mistakes to delay this job. In discussion with the BBB I found out Champion Windows has an F rating. Stay away from this company.
__label__1	The place is getting pricy on Saturday night the line for crab legs was rediculous they were bringing them out like every 20 minutes.  The staff was nasty to the customers especially the young man seating guests. The older gent with crew cut  don't know if Ian going back. I have been going there for the last 10  years but know between the price and rudeness im done   We need another Chinese place in Brandon. Even their lunch prices went up.
__label__1	Thank you very much for not selling me loaves of bread from the deli section, you just saved me $75 in groceries... Pretty pathetic how four dollars is going to wind up costing your store over $10,000 a year. As much as I love (d) Publix for the past 25 years,  this policy of not offering deli rolls (which taste much better than the same loaves in the bakery) for purchase is short-sided and ignorant. I doubt I will any response from Publix, and if I do I'm sure it will be generic and shallow.
__label__1	Just go to octopus and pay a little more. Fyi cleaning bug guts is not a part of a regular wash here, you will pay 6 dollars more for that. Now days a car wash isnt even a car wash. SMH.
__label__1	"Instead of offering ppl discounts to put great reviews, how about acknowledging and apologizing to the customer who had to experience the bugs and rodents. You haven't had a review in quite sometime. The moment you receive a bad one, now ""all of sudden"" you have FIVE more reviews that's all 5's?? Just recognize that there's a problem and apologize. I'll be back to check in a few days. Then my next stop will be to the Health Inspectors."
__label__1	FYI, just made the trip over to give them a try after reading reviews on Yelp and spending some time on their website and the business is Closed Today. No sign on the door. A Couple was leaving as I pulled up and said they weren't open. Then as I was leaving another couple drove up and said this is the second weekend in a row they attempted to get biscuits from here and it was closed. She said it's absolutely scrumptious when they are open for what it's worth.
__label__1	"Horrible bank. Complete Fraud. 

They make sure time and again their online payment portal gets stuck and will not let the monthly loan payment go through. They will then charge late fees for not making the payment on time. 

They might give you lower interest rates but will find creative ways to steal your money."
__label__1	This place treats their employees AWFULLY!  I will never step foot in there again.  By FAR one of the worst places in PA!  Sugar House and Valley Forge are what's UP!
__label__1	"My wife and I went to dine there as per recommendation of a friend. We had a roach sharing our table that we complained about. The waitress said: "" this is the French Quarter...It is dirty here"". Will recommend against going there for generations to come!!"
__label__1	"Will never go back. Blatantly was ignored by staff gave our table away after being told we were next after a 45 minute wait on a Tuesday night.  Bar tender did not bother to tell us what the draft/special were when asked he replied ""it's on the board"" we were at the far right side of the bar the board could not be seen... You guys get the idea. We eventually gave up and went to taco bus."
__label__1	"Food is good but the kitchen messed up the order. Waited 45 minutes for the food to be ready. Terrible customer service.

They didn't remake the wrong order but just changed the topping."
__label__1	Check your materials against what you bought.  They sent different material than what I had purchased.  They admitted that they probably sold my order and gave it to someone else. Now I am waiting for the material and install with empty bedrooms and no place to sleep.
__label__1	Came here tonight at 9:25 unaware that they close at 10. As soon as I was greeted I was told that they close at 10, and they like to leave exactly at 10. I said so does that mean I'm going to be kicked out in 30 minutes? The young lady with the septum pierced said no, it just means that the kitchen closes at 10 and we like to leave at 10. So I left because they obviously didn't want my money that bad, and I didn't want to rush. That was such a turn off. Won't be back here!
__label__1	Tim the service manage called me, I was traveling and could not take his call. When I got back, I called him back and had to leave a message. That was a Monday it is now Friday and have not gotten a call back. Don't want one now.
__label__1	Foods ok.. tacos are tiny.. the size of a sand dollar.. way overpriced. Not really worth it in my opinion.
__label__1	Waited in the lobby to order our food for 15 minutes without even being acknowledged. The manager said to lock the lobby doors so no one could come in and they weren't taking orders, if people leave they leave. At that point we left because of the poor service and they wouldn't even take our order. We drove over 10 miles out of our way to have Hardee's and were extremely disappointed.
__label__1	Very disappointed with the food.  I ordered pollo asado.  It was served with rice, beans, fried plantains and a green sauce.   Everything was saturated in oil.  I was unable to ingest all that oil.  Ended up throwing my food in the trash.  What a waste!!!!   If you want healthy food, this is not the place to go.   I was expecting only my plantain to be oily.  Not the whole meal.
__label__1	Terribly unorganized, slow and indifferent to customers. Food tasted like it sat out for 3 hours.
__label__1	"Had a horrible experience at this location.

The food is unbelievably over priced at $17 a person. The food was okay at best and at worse inedible. 

Was going to forget about it and just never return until I got to my car. Someone had purposely vomited on both sides of the car right where you would get in. 

Stay away from this location."
__label__1	This is actually the lamest pho i've ever had. The place was empty.@ lunchtime, which should have told me something. No beansprouts, chilis, or basil was offered with the soup which just tasted thrown together. The asian gent who came in after me got sprouts etc... so i can just surmise the lady was just judging i wouldn't miss them. The broth was a nice piping temperature but wholly unremarkable.
__label__1	I replaced the windows in my home 4 years ago.  This company has called me DAILY with robocalls saying I requested information on new windows.  I did not.  As soon as I get home from my trip, I'm filing a formal injunction against harassment on this company.  They have called my business mobile phone over 100 times.  Barry is a real DOUCHBAG.  If I did need windows, I would make sure I bought them anywhere but here.  Go Elsewhere!  Pella, which is what they sell, made a complete disaster out of a friends home when they removed the flashings.  This company SUCKS
__label__1	Drive thru menu was broken and blank, so I pulled around to order and was told I need to pull around back in the drive thru line and order off the blank menu. Chris at the window is one of a kind that's all I can say. Don't waste your hard earned money for disrespectful service that's my recommendations.
__label__1	Extremely overpriced. Food was not that great either. For what we paid, we sure were hoping for something a lot better.
__label__1	We went approximately 1.7 miles and were charged $20. I think the driver thought we were tourists. Wrong! This is why we take Uber.
__label__1	Perhaps it was all the wine tasting I'd done prior to eating here, but I just wasn't impressed! I've had better fish, chips & coleslaw at BJ's Brewhouse. The mushy peas were great, but it was also my first time having them so nothing else to compare them to. Also, the restaurant and bathroom were really dirty! And the staff were a bit... let's just say incompetent. Yuck.
__label__1	I had to take time off of work to meet with them two separate times and they were a no-show. They didn't have the courtesy to let me know they were going to come. First time scheduled to meet and they completely forgot. Re-scheduled and they were a no-show. Look elsewhere
__label__1	Not only is the food disgusting, but the service is terrible! The staff is extremely disrespectful and the overall experience is just awful. 0/10 would not recommend.
__label__1	"Quality of work is outstanding.  Sales integrity and follow up are absolutely horrible once you release your final payment.

They left rebar in my yard that I had to dispose of myself.  They took a chunk out of my stucco with the bucket on the skid steer and patched it but never returned to paint it.  They sold me a different remote than what they put on the paperwork.  We had a light die, and we have placed 2 phone calls and an online inquiry to get replaced, and they have not responded in over a month."
__label__1	Would give zero stars if I could. Most unsanitary spa I've ever been to. Total rip off for services performed with subpar service.
__label__1	The worse soup I've ever eaten, they need a Panera here
__label__1	I got acrylics done here 6 days ago. At day 3, one completely fell off (which isn't supposed to happen with acrylics) and now day 6 another one came clean off. This has never ever happened before and I get acrylics regularly. To say the least I'm highly disappointed.
__label__1	Horrible customer service, sat on hold for almost 30 minutes. No one ever answered! This is the second time this has happen.
__label__1	Sadly management changed and it is now called South Tampa Pizza. The new pizza is nothing like what it was before as Alan's. It was so gross I drove back over there to get a refund. I spit it out because it was inedible. Mushy and nasty. They told me they were experimenting with a dough recipe. I don't think as a paying customer I should be the guinea pig.
__label__1	Food was awful the only thing that was good was coleslaw! Meats where all over cooked Seriously wastes $35 bucks on lunch with my husband!! Horrible food!
__label__1	$3.50 delivery charge and then $1.00 to use the interact machine is brutal. Never order from here
__label__1	Not sure if this goes under the new restaurant or old, but my parents brought me here for dinner on Thanksgiving, and attempted to use the $50 gift certificate I bought for them last Christmas (only 11 months ago). Since the restaurant is under new ownership, they were told the gift certificate is no longer valid. I'm not sure I'll be returning here again...
__label__1	"I used to come here for lunch a lot. The food quality control has gotten bad, the employees don't know how to make good burritos, and its just a really bad experience right now. I just gave this location another chance and half the burrito was salsa and jalapenos, tortilla uncooked, employee unfriendly - I had to throw the burrito away and go somewhere else.

Much better burritos within a block of here to spend your $8-12 on."
__label__1	"Apparently, the owner (Fred) of this place has major psychological issues. Animals he has ""groomed"" have sustained injuries that have killed them. Today there are protestors outside making the public aware that if you love your pet, you absolutely shouldn't bring them here."
__label__1	Horrible.  After a 5 minute wait, someone finally asked us what we wanted.  He didn't ring it up correctly, and when we were presented with the food, the fellow argued with me that he HAD gotten it right.  Since he wouldn't correct it, we left with our food.  It wasn't until we were 20 minutes away and unable to turn around that we discovered that the hot chicken sandwiches were still frozen in the center.  Since there are 4 other shops I pass along my route, I'll never return.
__label__1	This place is just scary. We ended up here after a weird late trip and just needed a place to sleep. $117 for this? Place is old and nasty. Breakfast is not what I'm used to a super 8. The broken pipes outside and the collapsing stairs? Yeah, surprised this place is still open .
__label__1	I don't enjoy going to eat at a place where me ordering food, getting a refill and asking for hot sauce is an inconvenience to the entitled highschooler behind the counter. If you don't want to help customers, get out of customer service. Thank for showing me the definition of horrendous customer service.
__label__1	one of the worst experiences ever, so bad that I actually had to call 911 to get help as the driver was holding my bag hostage, this after going to wrong way to get to my house, and yelling at me because I said his car was filthy.  it was, the floor had actually peeled up and I was afraid to even put my foot down. the driver should never be allowed to drive any vehicle of any sort and needs a lot of remedial help in basic communication skills
__label__1	Absolute trash for a hotel that is supposed to be comparable to a Marriott hotel. Very little maintenance and it shows in the rooms. The beds are comfortable and the rooms are quiet, spacious and somewhat clean. The staff is so/so courteous and friendly.
__label__1	Very disappointed. I got a hot link plate with greens, sweet potatoes, and cornbread. The BBQ sauce was very disappointing, the links were cheap tasting and the greens had a after taste that I didn't like. The sweet potatoes were the only thing that was good. I don't even know of another soul food spot in Tucson so I was excited to try this out but naw, not coming back unless some real improvements take place
__label__1	Place is great but, it's 2017, and the old guy with glasses is probably the worst bar tender I've ever met. Never pours a beer right, always blames it on the keg, but once Daniel gets here the beer pours fine? Get a better bar tender!
__label__1	"Kitchen should be ashamed and those pics of food people have posted are no longer accurate. Many things have changed. 

Oyster Po boy- ousters were old and not fresh. 

Shrimp and grits was awful with tiny shrimp from a frozen bag. And sauce was brown water with hot sauce. 

Roast beef Po boy must have come from a Campbell's soup can. 

We sent it all back, were afraid to get sick."
__label__1	We waited 20 Mins to be greeted by anyone then just told to go sit where ever. The seating area was empty and yet the tables were dirty, there was a small cockroach in the Parmesan cheese and plates had old food on them. I won't eat here again
__label__1	The owners are not good ppl... The wife is a mean woman.. She wished a friend would get Cancer and Die, because he was helping with a Cancer Benifit and parked in the wrong place.. Please keep yourself AWAY FROM THIS STORE... THEY DONT DESERVE OUR BUSINESS..
__label__1	Enterprise rent a car review rented a Toyota Camry 3 March r ed turned it tuesday7 4days got my credit card bill 276 dollars of a charge  called my cosco credit card they  gave me a credit for the full amount never heard a word a phone call from enterprise went there left my phone no ever called me called yesterday said they would call a in 20 min still the credit card resolved the problem  but what makes me mad not even a call from enterprise if I had not noticed charge on my card and played it what would.happned I will contact better business berube discussed martin galligan
__label__1	"They lost my 401k rollover check in the mail. They don't send your checks via secure mail... they use standard for everything. I wonder where my $60 ""disbursement fee"" went then that they couldn't afford a service that lets you track such an important piece of mail. When I asked their customer service rep why this is the case she simply said ""ma'am we mail $1MM dollar checks via standard mail all the time"".... reassuring?"
__label__1	If I could give 0 stars I would. I had my tires changed in Canadian tire. I thought everything was okay until I found out they broke almost all the screws on my wheels. I had to get them replaced and paid more than $100 for that. Be careful, they don't care. They just want the job done and the person on the front desk is so rude.
__label__1	Terrible customer service and even worse delivery service. Never use this place. Just trying to help you out...
__label__1	"The pizza wasn't . It was edible. 
The guy staffs was nice. 
Place was very tiny: it was more a delivery pizza company than sit down place."
__label__1	Service was terrible. On a slow night waited more than 1 hour for dinner. Waiter was nowhere to be found, where other waitresses were hustling. Don't waste your time for the money & service there are many other alternatives in Media..
__label__1	"Had a full acrylic set put on a week ago, and they're already lifting and I could easily pop off the whole set in 10 mins. Not to mention the owner was doing my nails and had to take several breaks to answer the phone, help customers coming in, etc. 
will not be back to this business."
__label__1	Bar might be open until 1 am but the axe throwing is shut down at 10 pm on a Saturday. The beer selection here isn't all that great so there's no reason to go here instead of any of the other pubs in town on a Saturday night.
__label__1	Sub par renovation. Drinks are $10!  This isn't NYC. Even the monster is cheaper. Bartender took forever to notice us. No music, TVs are barely working. The place used to have charm. I know there are new owners (straight go figure), but the effort isn't there.  it's empty, sad and lacks everything.  I met my best friend there, now it's not there anymore, makes me very sad.
__label__1	Horrible service over the weekend. I went it and ordered pizza. They claim the individual pleaser price is $2.99. When the bill came it was $4.19 for the drink and salad. They refused to give me the discount. They said they would discount the pizza. I was still overcharged 1.50. Avoid this place. They are crooks.
__label__1	"When fast casual goes wrong it goes REALLY wrong. Ordered pizza, salad and meatballs, we never got the pizza and it took 40 minutes to take it off our bill. After 3 requests to discuss my complaint, the hulking manager momentarily managed to unslack his jaw, put down his meth pipe, and taunt me for being pissed.

The salad was actually decent but overall the experience was pretty ghastly."
__label__1	Don't go to this place expecting to see the car you had picked out online it's not here. It's a bait and switch situation horrible expect to spell spend the day and get nothing
__label__1	Horrible service, horrible self-service app on self serve iPad, rude servers. No customer service to speak of, COLD latte, type a message on the iPad; see if anyone cares. Sad. Avoid. The entire restaurant is on auto-pilot by way of a self serve app. Don't like the service? Then leave because it's your own fault. You are serving yourself.
__label__1	This is by far one of the most unprofessional companies I've ever worked with. They never returned your calls,  charge you for work they didnt perform, and the work they do is not good quality. Dont even consider using this company without reading all the reviews here and on google.
__label__1	"Tried this bakery for the first time today. We asked for 2 coffee's and a scone. No decaf coffee available, no cream or milk! Really? At a bakery, they have no milk?! In the process of eating the scone, saw that it was covered with mold!! YUK!!! I told the associate and she said ""Oh, sorry. Opened up the cash register and gave me a refund for the scone."" Customer service a big fat ZERO. Would not recommend this bakery."
__label__1	"Went there for lunch today. Terrible food. The burger was sent back twice for being rare, yet the cheese and bacon on top were burnt and ""melted away."" The onion soup was very salty. The people next to us were very unhappy as well. This place is not cheap - it should have been much better. The Peacock Cafe at the Grounds for Sculpture has more choices, healthier, cheaper and tastes better!
Our server was nice but the food - not acceptable."
__label__1	My husband and I went here and they had no food they were running out of everything and not replacing anything they had an hour and a half before close so this is unexceptionable so I asked them to take my 16 dollar buffet off and they said no because I had a cup wonton soup broth so they charged me like I ate the whole buffet which is so wrong I definitely won't be going back here it is a rip off I don't recommend here as they don't keep the buffet full and the staff is rude
__label__1	Waiters are stupid enough to completely forget my order. Had me waiting 30 minutes for nothing.
__label__1	I assume they did a fine job picking up my wrecked vehicle. I don't know for sure because I wasn't present. But when I went the next day to clean out my car, since it was considered a total loss, they had dropped it off somewhere else. It's not a huge deal, but I didn't authorize the move and now I have to go across town to remove my items. After a life threatening accident, this is the last thing I want to do.
__label__1	Had stuff to do Sunday so I ordered two breakfast sandwiches. That's fine whatever so I get over there in 10 minutes. They didn't even start making them so I told them to keep it. I don't understand what happened to actually caring about the customers needs. If you call something for a pick up the least they can do is start making it!
__label__1	Rude bartenders.  The place is pretty dead.  I am not sure how they stay in business but the bartenders have way to much attitude.  I live in the FQ and would not go there.
__label__1	The experience and help from the staff is always professional the past two times I've visited. But wait  3rd visit was different when I was given Dr.K. She was rude and never contacted back although she said she would. I don't recommend this place even if it's the last animal hospital during a pandemic
__label__1	Completely understand they are understaffed I assume due to the aftermath of COVID-19. Seeing an employee vaping in the bathroom and taking their time was annoying. It took 35 minutes to be seated, over an hour to get our food. Then when we were ready to leave. It took another 20 minutes to get our check and pay. They were not at all packed or full so this was very disappointing.
__label__1	"Worst service eveeeeeeer.  We waited and waited for a server.  Then waited and waited for our drinks.  Then waited and waited and waited for nachos.  Nachos!  How long do nachos really take?  When we finally got them they were super sparse.  I'm pretty sure our sever was drunk or still feeling the affects of last nights partying.  It was bad.

The manager came over (because the server agreed that the nachos were sparse) and comp'ed our bill, which was super nice and very appreciated."
__label__1	Completely confused by the great reviews.  If you have even stayed at a holiday inn or better, you would realize what a dump this place is.  We had ants in our room and they came in a sprayed chemicals everywhere.  Rooms look like a motel from 1970.
__label__1	A nearly complete failure. Bad service. Bad food. Something is seriously wrong here. I have eaten at the other locations and they were much better.
__label__1	They won't stop calling you even when you ask them to stop.  I brought in my Honda Fit once for an oil change.  Every two weeks they'll call me to inquire if I'm ready to purchase a new car.  I've said no and asked them not to call anymore but every two weeks guess what happens?  Avoid this dealership.
__label__1	They won't even answer their phones or reply to voicemail. After trying to get in touch with them for more than two days, they say that they're fully booked for the next two and a half weeks. Typical lazy Tucson workers.
__label__1	Ordered the sea bass last night and it was brought out cold and uncooked. Management took it off the bill and offered dessert but the damage was done. Errors like that are unacceptable of a steakhouse of this level.
__label__1	We arrived at 8pm to a parking garage with 3 cars and a completely empty waiting room to be told by the unsympathetic (borderline rude) receptionist that there is a 2.5 hour wait although she couldn't explain how since there was no one else there. Drove 5 minutes up the road to CHOP Pediatric Urgent Care and even though they were actually busy, we were in and out in under and hour with cheerful and comforting staff.
__label__1	completely AWFUL!!!! the wash messed up apparently & a huge monster truck was in front of us. the monster truck hit the brakes & sat there... the tracks continued to move our car & BOOM we smashed into the monster truck (our nissan maxima). what the heck........ our grill is messed up & took off the nissan logo on the grill. i'm beyond furious with this wash. stay AWAY!!!!!!
__label__1	It was just sad. Paying money for a chance to eat some of the best food in the world and what was served was very very small bites of garbage! In the first hour and a half I had tried just 3 barely spoonfuls of glop. A complete waste of time and money. Honestly take your money and randomly pick any restaurant in the French Quarter and go and eat and I guarantee you that you will be better served than by this fraud. There are so many great things to do in NOLA don't let this be one of them. There is nothing good about this tour, absolutely nothing.
__label__1	"This place is dirty and chaotic. They don't go over any rules with the kids prior to them playing so it's absolutely crazy. Multiple kids going down the slide at the same time, climbing over each other and it's just an injury waiting to happen. 

Also, we were there for a party and during the food time my son found a live roach on his pizza plate. Absolutely unacceptable. We will not be returning at any time."
__label__1	Frequent smoke breaks, must be supervised all times, quote was way under actual.  Complaints were not answered.  They even left cupboards full and did not set everything up at new place.  NEVER use these guys.
__label__1	"I was really excited to have dinner here, but sadly, the mu shu was incredibly sweet. And they serve their mu shu with tortillas. The same tortillas you would receive at a Mexican restaurant!

In all my decades of eating Chinese food, I have never seen or heard of such a thing. Really disappointing."
__label__1	I was told one price then given a different price. The guy that gave me that price wasn't around so I was told I could wait one more day after I wait 4 or 5 days plus I got charged full price for a rental and when I call for a explanation I get no answer or the voice mail. And lets not forget when I bought the truck I was told I had bumper to bumper warranty which I wouldn't have to worry about any repairs which I payed an extra $3000 for. I feel like I got hustled!
__label__1	I wish I could give this place no stars! It's awful! It's dirty, smells bad and only has 1 person working at the deli counter during a time when everyone is off of work. Waiting in line 20 minutes for lunchmeat is horrible. They are always out of things that I need. I try to stop here as little as I possibly can, but they are the closest place to me that sells Boar's Head lunchmeat so I'm kind of STUCK dealing with it. I HATE THIS PLACE! AVOID IT IF YOU CAN!!!
__label__1	It's too bad zero stars isn't an option. I can't even review the food because I've never received it. I've tried to order delivery from here twice, and my food never arrived. I had to call GrubHub to request a refund each time after calling the restaurant and getting a busy signal. Don't bother. They'll probably be closed soon, and rightfully so.
__label__1	It's a shame this place is the United airlines of restaurants. Atmosphere is good food is  good but evidently needs of the customers are not too important. You're not allowed to make any changes on their menu items whatsoever. Our waitress told us you can't even change it in the computer if we wanted to. So I guess they know what you like better than you know what you like. -4 stars
__label__1	My friends and I came here for drinks. Initially we had a great experience but when staff turned over we felt judged and disrespected. The food was fine but very overpriced. We had 3 different waitress', the first waitress was amazing and so nice (shout out Amanda!) and the last waitress was a complete 180. The waitress was rude and judge mental. Very disappointed with this place because it's usually a great spot.
__label__1	If I could leave zero stars that would be more accurate. The food was totally disgusting and the service wasn't much better. STARVE FIRST IF YOU MUST.
__label__1	High prices, crappy food, lousy service, this place has it all if you are a masochist. The disappointment is mind-boggling. You'd be better off flushing your money down the toilet and saving your time.
__label__1	Rude/unprofessional/I had my carpets cleaned by them a few years ago. Yesterday they were cleaning my neighbors apartment. Castro's employees decided to talk sh@t about me and my apartment to my neighbor. Then go on to talk sh@t about how I look. What type of unprofessional assh@les are you guys? Don't you guys have anything better to do then act like children?
__label__1	"Charge 5 dollars more than pricing on signs! 
And fail to inform customers until it's time to pay, they did it to a lady leaving before me. They charged her 40$ for Acrylics she said She called and asked how much she was told 35$ but apparently the ""shape"" makes a difference and my gel polish was 20$ when then have two signs outside saying 15$. I was in search of a regular nails salon close by and this one is definitely off my list."
__label__1	Not at all like normal Chinese food.  General Tso's chicken was basically dry with barely any sauce.  The Broccoli was hard, not al dente.  Unfortunately the boneless BBQ ribs were also dry and no sauce.  Not even on the side.  It was just dry pieces of red meat.  The pork dumplings had no flavor and the sauce only made them more than edible.  Has to be the WORST Chinese food I have ever eaten.  Not just for New York standards.  I am talking ever.
__label__1	if you wish to have piss poor service ask for Josh the manager and Maggie also manager worst people to deal with and lie to secure sales
__label__1	Terrible! The mac n cheese was old and brown and nasty. The biscuits were old. They didnt ask what kind of dipping sauce i wanted. But that doesnt matter because the chicken tenders were old and hard. I had one good potatoe wedge. The rest of the meal i threw away! A waste of my money. Next time i will go to the checkers next door to this location. At least their food is always good and the service is way better!
__label__1	I usually give places the benefit of the doubt, but fruit flies around the bar. Call Jon Taffer
__label__1	Bad cooking, seafood is not fresh, some of the fried meat is rotten, one of the female servers(heavier set) is rude, no clear indication of take out price, over charge at the Check out, overall, bad experience and won't be back
__label__1	We ordered all you can eat sushi. The first order was fine. When asking for a slip to place a second order the waitress was rude and reluctantly gave us an order slip. We are not sure of some of the items that came out on our plate. Quite a few pieces we've never seen before and looked like all vegetable. The sushi tasted very bland and most of the rolls barely filled. The owner and wait staff were rude and condescending. We will not be back.
__label__1	I am a regular customer in this place and I buy 3-4 onigiri all the time, but tonight was disappointing. on the picture that I added you can see an onigiri salmon but where is the salmon? Now I realized buying onigiri when the owner is not there is no good. hopefully even the workers can make a better onigiri and not just put all rice on it. now I am eating a rice wrap up with seaweed. Hopefully this won't happen again. This is one of my favorite Japanese place for onigiri but not anymore.
__label__1	Pancakes were so over cooked husband was picking off burnt black pieces. Waitress never brought our orange juice. Ordered bacon, got sausage instead. Pancake buddies were extremely greasy and also over cooked/burnt. It's now 3am and husband is running to the bathroom. Stomach aches for hours. Avoid this place there are better places to eat in town. Will not be back.
__label__1	Be careful with this place. At the open call auditions for the acting program one of the teachers literally called a student Fat to her face IN FRONT OF EVERYONE (during orientation before we started auditions) and made the comment that she may not get many jobs because of the way she looked....I was honestly appalled. After I was accepted I ripped up the acceptance letter and threw it away. Don't support an institution like this, it's 2020. Stay far away from this place, your better off considering outside schools.
__label__1	I waited in line for 30 minutes. I ordered an iced latte and a bagel. I received a latte with more sugar in it than coffee and a completely burnt bagel.  It was not a pleasant experience.
__label__1	waited an awful long time to get my food even after others who ordered after we got theirs. seriously it was only a sandwich
__label__1	rude lady pharmacist.  Counter help is friendly sometimes.  Sometimes not.  I'll go elsewhere
__label__1	This is the most disappointing restaurant I've been to in Nashville. Our eggs were watery and looked like they had been cooked in a microwave. The potatoes were stale and cold. The service was decent and coffee okay. Honestly, spend your money somewhere else. There are so many amazing places to eat in Nashville, this is not one of them.
__label__1	I wouldn't go here! Terrible service. I went here for graduation night & the manager was rude. Had bottle service ( 4 bottles) no lights & they poured bottles into a glasses bottle. Very disappointed. I wish I never partied here. They charged my card an extra 140 after I sent 1,000 there. Food is good tho.
__label__1	It's cheap, that's the only good thing. This store is always a wreck. It's dirty. It's disorganized. The checkout lines are always long when I go there. I'm glad I'm making more money now and can shop somewhere else.
__label__1	Wouldn't give this place my business--owner keeps his dog out in all temps and weather. Inhumane.  SPCA has already been out there several times in the past few years.
__label__1	"Wasted almost 2 hours over a month tracking down missing reward voucher from Chase Marriott Credit Card.  In the end, the explanation I received made sense, however, the attitude and flippant tone by ""Freeman"" from Chase and ""Ron Moore"" at Marriott was unnecessary and demeaning."
__label__1	Well tried to eat here but the smoke was over powering. Even at that they ran out or steal and ran out of chicken....... seriously?? Bummer, had a craving for it all day so. Decent menu went with a hot turkey not really in the mood for it might eat it later and update. 45 min for my to go hot turkey uhhhhh
__label__1	You ever wake up in the morning craving a Bacon egg and cheese biscuit? So you. Order 2 from McDonalds on your way home from your Dr appointment.  You pour yourself a large glass of milk.  Separate the sandwiches you ordered For your wife and kids.  Only to find that you have been given bacon Egg and cheese McGriddles?   Total let disappointment.
__label__1	If you enjoy dining with flys, being seated beneath a fly trap with thousands of dead decaying flys, and the aroma of decayed, rotted flesh then this is the the place for you. Also don't be hungry or in a hurry. Takes approximately 50 minutes to get your food. Enjoy.
__label__1	Waited over 25min for my order which was inedible  when I got it. Avoid this place at all costs. Places like  this give New Orleans a bad reputation.
__label__1	"My wife and I were appalled. I'm not exagerating when I say ninety percent of my wife's kung pao chicken was anything but kung pao chicken. It had gobs of bamboo, water chestnuts, broccoli, green bell peppers and onions; none of which are ingredients of kung pao chicken. Her kung pao chicken tasted exactly the same as my hunan chicken - like bitter green bell peppers.

Neither dish was spicey; just bland and bitter. Shame on you for claiming to make chinese food."
__label__1	"small menu. sloooooow service. small servings. mediocre food.
 cold, bitter coffee. very expensive for what you get. i live around the corner, but will drive to Montgomeryville for Pumpernicks for good deli."
__label__1	The owner doubled rents and now there is nothing much there anymore - their biggest loss is the antique mall - which brought my family and friends in which led to perusing the rest of the mall getting ice cream and juices and such but won't be going back anymore - sad to see sub a cool plCe become empty or worse be torn down. In the future - sad sad sad
__label__1	I was hoping for a cool, trending Mexican restaurant while in town. I travel weekly, and Mexican is one of my top choices while traveling. This is one of the lowest quality, service. Their tacos (lobster, Maui, and Shrimp) where flat out poor quality. Guacamole is bad, salsa is bad and watered down (store bought).
__label__1	If I could give this place zero stars, I would.  All I can say is BYOP - Bring Your Own Purell.  I'm sure there are plenty of bars on Bourbon that have shady practices, but if you go in the women's bathroom in any sort of established bar or restaurant you should be able to wash your hands with soap without having to pay for it!  There is a female bathroom attendant for the women's bathroom that makes you tip her to use the soap and a paper towel.  What kind of place does this?  Are you going to start charging your patrons for the toilet paper too?
__label__1	I bought a hazelnut latte and the flavor was just non existence. Sadly I love coffee and this did not do it for me.
__label__1	I am very annoyed!! I went to grab something to eat late night because it was close to my house. I pulled up to hear someone say they were closed. I was like what?? Are you kidding me so I asked when is the next one open??? They told me Prater Way in Sparks. Nope I get there and they are closed. So I can't even give them a star! But because Yelp makes me give at least on but I don't want to because they were not opening like they are supposed to be
__label__1	"Wish I had read some of the other reviews before we came in here. The fried pickles were excellent which is the only positive. Sat at a high top in the corner of the bar and waited a good 15 minutes before anyone even came over to ask what we wanted. Place was not all that crowded. 

We order 2 dozen aw oysters and I've never had a an oyster that tasted as bland as these did literally no brine and no flavor"
__label__1	"Wouldn't recommend gel pedicures. My polish was bumpy so I asked him to fix it then he broke my toe nail, got up, walked away, and made another lady come fix it. He didn't say anything, now my actual nail is now broken and uneven. This was handled very poorly. 5 different people came up to look at it and instead of trying to fix the issue and is trying to argue that my nails were the issue when it was the nail tech. No discount, nothing very rude at checkout saying ""things happen"". 0/10"
__label__1	Needs new management this locations going down hill fast - foods decent lobby's permanent closed / severely under staffed
__label__1	"My fiance and I requested 2 vegeratian plates on their menu and requested without cheese and sour cream because we are vegan. 

After more than 1 hour waiting for our food and then arrived with cheese and with MEAT on it.

Terrible service."
__label__1	"After reading several reviews it seems Tanya Mowell, quite unfortunately Hilmeade's property manager, is notorious here for her lack of professionalism- driving people out of their homes by way of her rudeness and incapacity to provide service. Maybe if she focused more on tasks of her job description like managing property, maybe, and/or customer service, she and her property would have better reviews.  :-/ 
Thankful to not have even been given the chance to move into a complex with such compulsive, intrusive, and ill-mannered staff."
__label__1	"Google says this location is open at 4AM. No indication of hours of operation on Yelp. Chili's was even opened at this airport.

Not a person to be seen behind the counter. It's unfortunate because I just wanted to purchase a New Orleans mug for a gf."
__label__1	FLEA or BEDBUG bites. Woke up with bites all along my stomach. I called  for days trying to get a refund (with timestamped photos for proof) - front desk kept telling me that the manager would get back to me.  I tried again on the 4th day using the same phone number - they blocked my phone number. Oh, they also don't tell you on the phone or online that they are undergoing remodeling and the hotel looks like a construction site/murder house. DO NOT STAY HERE. I wish I could give it 0 stars.
__label__1	Very disappointed. Heard great things about this place. However, the owner does not support Veterans. Stay away.
__label__1	The rudest customer service I've ever experienced in my life. Clerk: 08, she made me feel like I was a nuisance to her because I had to mail out a package and asked her a question about sizing then she ignored me after telling me she couldn't print my receipt.
__label__1	Everytime I go to this location, it was a bad experience. Employees are so stupid and don't know what they are doing. The manager is useless. This location is simply aweful.
__label__1	Don't waste your time. Overpriced drinks and terrible service. I had half a vodka soda left, the server took it for some reason, then my wife ordered a vodka pineapple for herself. The server brought back a vodka soda we never ordered? Place smells like sewage and hasn't had a deep clean since it opened. It's gross.
__label__1	Apps were superb..entrees were not as described and lacking any seasoning...grilled chicken..I think not looked and tasted boiled!...go to volver or village whiskey or tinto... Jose will hook you up with really good food!
__label__1	"The worst experience living there! A real dump. Dark and gloom! After one year there, they raised my rent $105.00/month. I gave 30 day moveout notice. My big mistake was to not get a final walk through. They kept my $700 deposit and sent $1624.00 to collections for floor damages. They are shrewd liars because I left the apartment clean and left nothing behind. 
This is a very dishonest corporation to rent from."
__label__1	This is probably one of the worst Asian restaurants that has been to. The place is consistently lacking. Whether it's from the customers or the air filtration or cleanliness I said I would not come back. I did it against my better judgement just give them another chance it is not worth it. NO WATER IDS SERVED IF YOU DINE IN....I MEAN C'MON REALLY? I THOUGHT THAT'S AN OBVIOUS
__label__1	When they first opened, the place was spotless. Not anymore...the floor was so dirty, I would not walk barefoot to reach my sandals after my pedicure. Looking at the baseboards next to the sink was disgusting. The man who did my pedicure was very rough.  He had this sharp thing and was cleaning under my nails and I had to pull my foot away it hurt so much. I know I will not go back.
__label__1	Stinks.  Warm beer, crappy service.  Burger was good but not good enough.  Not returning.
__label__1	Hard to understand why rude, passive aggressive behaviours are occurring at this location from the staff/receptionist when their job is already done by a kiosk! Asking for a wait time does not constitute unacceptably rude answering! Specially after a long wait.
__label__1	I would not recommend this place to anyone! We have two units here and they were both broken into. We were assured it would be fixed immediately and a week later when we went to check, the units were still broken. Anyone could have gone in and stolen our things. Also, we went today to move things out of our storage and in one of the units, the floor was completely flooded. Some of our expensive frames were damaged and throw pillows were mildewed. I would never use this place again and quite frankly I'm pissed about paying these people to keep my belongings safe.
__label__1	My dog has anxiety issues due to being abused before we adopted him (and the scars to prove it). The staff here felt the need to muzzle him and parade all sorts of other animals in front of him. The techs at this place need a lesson in kindness and compassion. We will not be back.
__label__1	After reading the great reviews I decided to try Cannoli Queen. I couldn't have been more disappointed. Yes, the family is very nice and friendly but that doesn't make up for the food. I ordered the lasagna and I was shocked to watch them pull it, pre made and wrap in plastic wrap, out of the fridge to heat it up. Once we got our food it was on aluminum take out containers even though we dined in. I was not impressed with the quality or freshness, especially for the rather expensive price. I would never go back.
__label__1	"Disappointing. Drove from Miami to celebrate Mother's Day with my mom and family & made reservations for this restaurant. The cold appetizers and sushi were spot on - great. However the hour and a half wait for our 3 fish dishes & extra sharing sides that came out COLD - have given this place a 1 star from us.

Bummer, we're huge foodies and love to support local restaurants but this one is off our list as a repeater."
__label__1	My waitress was very inattentive, didn't check in not one time. Constantly passed us up almost as if she was ignoring us. This place won't get my money anymore.
__label__1	Everyone in indy must go here for dollar doubles cause there always 15 deep at drive thru. This place can't make an ice coffee if it was the only thing on the menu and if you go inside its like trying to order a burger on the beaches of Normandy on D day. Total kaos
__label__1	This is not a place you want to buy anything. Service, delivery and installation all contracted to people who are obviously willing to work cheap. Poor at returning phone calls. My last experience resulted in 3 failed attempts to deliver and install a microwave. We finally went in picked it up ourselves and had a good installer recommended by home advisor finish this unpleasant experience. Just say no to HH Gregg.
__label__1	Don't buy the warranty! The display went out on my husband's phone. Paid $270 to get it fixed. 3 months later it's out again & they won't honor the warranty due to a couple of minor scratches - not shattered or broken, just lightly scratched. Complete scam.
__label__1	So many options in Metairie. They think they are on Bourbon street. Consistency, price and advertising is horrible. Don't waste your money here !!!!
__label__1	"The worst service ever! We had a Saturday brunch reservation that was done 3 weeks in advance, we arrived early and they gave us the smallest foldable ""stool table"" to eat brunch on while the other tables were completely free and the waitress kept telling us the other tables were the same which made zero SENSE. Will never return to this place!"
__label__1	"Angry to say the least my boyfriend and I showed up at 730 for dinner and by no means were we intoxicated beyond any limit.  The guard said we were too intoxicated to be seated be had literally walked around for hours and had
Three drinks during this time. We made the mistake of arguing with the idiot security. We are both military server 13 and 17 years and by no means were in a state of intoxication. Screw thus place it was recommended by a friend and close to where we Parked."
__label__1	Let me try to say something good about this place. Good location, new and nice decor; affordable price. I mentioned affordable; not reasonable because the quality of food is such that any price would feel unreasonable. The fries were burned; I guess that where the Flamme part comes. Average burgers.
__label__1	If you're looking for authentic japanese food with good quality for a good price. This is NOT the place for you.
__label__1	Terrible place to go during covid. The museum was packed on a weekday early afternoon. Each gallery had easily 20-30 people. I was told max capacity for museum was 60 but there was easily 3-4 times that many that I saw. No social distancing enforcement and tons of large groups configuring in confined spaces. AVOID AT ALL COSTS if you care about your safety and health during the pandemic. Extremely disappointing & shocking experience.
__label__1	Don't do it. It's not safe, and a ton of sketchy people live here. Cops called constantly to this location.
__label__1	This is a place to go ONLY if you are a regular. Otherwise you'll be ignored by the staff and given dirty looks by the regulars until you leave. Steer clear. Food is pretty average, the beer selection isn't bad but the atmosphere kills it.
__label__1	This was my first time here and I got dip powder and I asked for a coffin shape and he first didn't give me that until I asked again at the end. Then when I got back to my car I noticed my nails were basically glued down to my fingers and I had to scrape powder out from under them causing me to bleed. There is also powder stuck around my nails on my skin. I have been getting dip powder done for awhile now and this is by far the worst service I have received.
__label__1	Very disappointing. Breakfast was limited. No pancakes as we went in a Thursday. Food was ok. Nothing special. Not worth the prices. Four of us spent $50 for breakfast. Crazy. Will not go back.
__label__1	Nasty place. Please for your own good, do not stay here!! Says no smoking but smells heavily like smoke, cigarette burns all over the comforter. Bugs in the room. We had to switch rooms when there was a large hornet we discovered hanging around. Stains on the sheets. Definitely some drugged up people hanging around and being rowdy. This is not safe and not well maintained. Very over priced at $70 a night! Avoid please. Other Red Roof Inns are much more impressive and comfortable.
__label__1	"Terrible service and terrible people that work there. 

They are careless, charge a lot, rude and when you need further help with your glasses or prescription good luck  getting any service."
__label__1	"Just left this place and I would not recommend this place to anyone. Service is horrible; and they are like robots with NO customer service experience. The food was not impressive at all (McDonald's has better burgers, and I don't even like Mcdonald's). 

A gentleman with a cane fell on the floor, because the employee was mopping and the staff didn't bother  to help him up. If I could give a minus star I would give them a -4."
__label__1	Took my car in for the oil change service. Once my car was finished being serviced I noticed valuables including my loose change had been stolen from my car. The store manager was a waste of time who did nothing to help. I called the police who came and after viewing the video footage told me that the footage is worthless. Cameras are too far away and cloudy to see anything. So I got a decent price on an oil change but robbed for over $600 worth of items. One of the worst experiences in my life. Don't trust these people.
__label__1	I hate to be so critical of a longstanding local restaurant, but after eating here for the first time, I'm left with the negative impression that this is low grade mall food court type Chinese food. Styrofoam and plastic everything, bland food, blander sauces, and meh service. What really stood out though was the terrible chow mein and soy sauce. How do you mess these up? Hope this place can turn it around... we won't be back anytime soon.
__label__1	"Not a great experience.

Although my stylist was nice, and she seemed to ask the right questions, she came nowhere near my inspiration photo. I paid $160 for a color and cut that I'm going to another salon to fix. Maybe I didn't explain myself well, but I had a photo?? Not going back."
__label__1	"Well, my appointment was set for 930am to have an estimate done. It's now 11:09am and I have left two messages. If you are not going to make it, please call. 

FYI: I did further research after the tardiness and failure to call. Please google the company. The reviews are pretty scary."
__label__1	Terrible customer service save your money and go elsewhere This place doesn't  deserve one star
__label__1	My friend and I went there tonight for appetizers before a movie. We sat at the bar and informed the bartender of our food order. We denied his request of drinks twice and requested water instead. Bartender didn't put in the order. We decided to change our order and informed him of the new order and waited for our food for at least 10 minutes or so.  We called the bartender back to pay only to be informed he hadn't put in our order at all.  We got up and left. Twice no order was placed despite placing the orders and we never got the waters. Just bad service.
__label__1	The service was horrible, waited and waited and no one came. Couldn't get a seat at the carousel so sat in the bar area. Another couple came in sat down for 5 minutes and a waitress came over and took their order. We had waited 20 minutes with no service. Needless to say we got up and left and took our money elsewhere.  Definitely not worth the walk through the quarter to get there. Will never go back nor recommend it to any one else. Disappointed experience.
__label__1	We went with about 8 people during restaurant week, and half of us got food poisoning. Will never be going back. Also, the food was blah.
__label__1	This place is really depraved. This is the worst broadway bar. It is jammed pack and sometimes it is dangerous on the third floor. I watched some american idol person here and it wasn't that good.
__label__1	NOLA has so many amazing places to eat. Please don't bother with this place.  Don't believe the hype.  Gumbo came out cold and had shells in it, followed by cold meals - their remedy, heat the plate not the food- REALLY?   Server non-existent, I had to get up to find him twice.  The place is in need of a good cleaning too.
__label__1	All I have seen employees do is stand out back and fight and smoke cigarettes! Wow non stop!
__label__1	Has absolutely went down hill I'd ask for a refund but I paid cash plus tipped I used to like this place but it had gone to far I got a tiny chicken sandwich and a portion of frys ment for a child for 13+ tax and each side is 5$ my meal in total was 30$ and btw there banana pudding poppers are churro donuts no banana pudding
__label__1	Got a pedicure here last October and was left with two toes bleeding in three places. First time I have ever been nicked during a pedicure. Never again.
__label__1	Mediocre food matched with terrible service and atrocious pricing. Never coming back.
__label__1	went there for dinner last night it was horrible. no food in stations. salad was empty no fruit alot of the sides and main dishes empty also.  asked to talk to manager he never came out to address the issues asked for a refund and the manager promptly appeared and gave us our money back no apoligizies or questions just matter of factly gave us our money back very bad experience
__label__1	"Careless and don't even think that an appointment means anything. 

Came in for a new set ( the old nails was just overlay)   they started soaking my existing acrylic off (which is never the way they have done this)  put me in the back row and have been sitting here now for 30 minutes.   I removed my own acrylic other wise my fingers would still be lopsoaking in acetone. Not one person has come to check on me.  NOT ONE!!!!  

]
It's sad when you know the owner is not here to make sure the place runs smoothly."
__label__1	My wife and I just brought her Galaxy S6 in because it started overheating and smoking while charging. One of the reps here (a dude with a man bun--didn't catch his name) started off suggesting that we'd gotten it wet before charging and were trying to grift them into giving us a new phone. Bottom line, we experienced awful customer service here and are planning to switch to Verizon. Don't go here if you can avoid it.
__label__1	"I was a customer here several years ago.  I would be very wary of going there.  They had a system then where they would allow you to pay but credit card 'the first time' and then cash only after.  Had to use ATM there. Tax evasion? Who knows.  
The owner went MIA, and while has health problems, it seemed like major mgmt issues there. For the amount of money the services cost, glad I moved on."
__label__1	Horrible practice.  They constantly cancel cleanings and then don't reschedule.....don't care about their patients.
__label__1	Even though I watched them make their pizza, still tastes like a frozen pizza to me.
__label__1	They desperately need more help. Longest lines on a Monday I've ever seen. Over 30 minutes in line.
__label__1	Great place ,  but I actually got kicked out of there and threatened by one of the cooks boyfriend, the cops came to kick me out just for speaking my opinion.. This place sucks so does low tres amigos and mainly the third place they own.
__label__1	Far and above the worst donuts I have ever had. They were very hard and stale and had absorbed too much of the oil while cooking, also the oil they were cooked in tasted old and like it had been used to cook something other than donuts, like egg rolls. I started to get sick to my stomach after a couple bites and had to throw them away. I have no idea how this place has so many good reviews. I can only assume that all the kids and their families from the Discovery Science Museum are flooding yelp with their reviews.
__label__1	This place consistently has terrible customer service. Their staff continues to cycle and the customer service doesn't get any better. I've been renting here for 2 years because of an ongoing issue with my car and my warranty company has an account with them. Above and beyond is not in their repertoire, basic customer service and decency is barely part of it. Elise has to be hands-down one of the most condescending associates that works here. Simply disgusting and dishonest. Choose another location if you can, the egos here are ridiculous.
__label__1	Yelp states it's 24/7 it's closed at1:53 am on Saturday night!! That's beyond unbelievable unacceptable!!!  Negative 5 stars!!!!
__label__1	Would give 0 stars but not an option.  Were out of almost every bagel.  Sort of like a gas station being out of gas.  No hot tea either.  Not sure what the manager was managing. 6 employees visible with no bagels and none of them making any more?!
__label__1	This place deserves no stars. The place is filthy. There's only one lady here that actually does nails and toes the right way. They have this young girl working that can't do nails or toes to save her life. Ain't no way she should be working here.
__label__1	3 stars for flavor. Would give 0 stars for service.  Paid for 14 piece meal but got way fewer pieces.   Highly recommend that you check your food before leaving.
__label__1	Spectrum is terrible. I would not recommend them to anyone!  Service is outdated. They are the only internet in my area. So I am stuck with them for this service. Price is over $90/month for internet only  I feel like they are taking advantage of the situation
__label__1	No personality. First thing out of his mouth was that I needed surgery. He didn't discuss my X-ray nor my MRI. Knew absolutely nothing about me. This was my very first visit. It was a TERRIBLE experience. I understand that he's a surgeon and they like to cut. But at least find out my history by asking: When the pain started? What have I been doing to cope? What's my pain level? SOMETHING! I'll never return and I'll be sure to tell all that I know of how  horrible my experience was.
__label__1	Wish I could say I had a better experience but I ordered a classic cheeseburger and when it arrived ,after a very long time, I bit into the burger and pulled out paper that was still attached to the cheese. When the issue was brought up to the waiter he said he'd take care of it and when asked for the check to leave I was still charged for burger. The burger had no flavor and was slightly burnt on top of the cheese incident
__label__1	Rude service, stale food. Malika should not be working the counter. Doubt i will come back.
__label__1	Had to wait ONE HOUR for 2 milkshakes because they continually forgot our order. Everyone in there looked annoyed. Overpriced shitty food. Don't waste your time everyone
__label__1	The Slade in Channelside literally has diarrhea slopped on the outside wall and management has done nothing to clean it up for days after being notified. Keep that in consideration if your thinking about renting here. A negative star rating would be most appropriate.
__label__1	Ordered two pizzas for delivery. Ordered one extra, extra, crispy. It came as one big soggy sloppy undercooked mess. Specifically called the restaurant and told them I only had a $100 bill for a $40 order. Driver showed up, who was an employee of said restaurant, and no one told him I had a $100 bill. If you're a pizzeria, and you can't cook a pizza as requested, it's not acceptable. If you're charging $20 for a 12 inch pizza, get it right!
__label__1	Some of the workers are racist. Some of my family went there today and they were rude and disrespectful.
__label__1	Ordered a cake for a first birthday and asked for a princess crown on top of it and its flat on top of the cake. They're rude and not helpful what so ever. Instead of paying $65 for this cake I would have been better off going shoprite. Don't waste your money, Carlo's is no better hear than Hoboken.
__label__1	"Horrible customer service 
No direction or sense of urgency for seating server told me since he rang in my order I couldn't change it but add it and charge for the add on. Then the bar tender says if she is having long day. I am a server and would never refusing a customer of something I know could be changed the ne"
__label__1	Not impressed at all. Ordered a red rock bison burger medium rare, and it came out completely well done as if it had been cooked in the microwave. No flavor to the meat at all. Complementary pickles tasted like ocean water. Service was ok. Charging $18 for a 6-8 oz burger that wasn't cooked even remotely close to how it was ordered is pretty bad. Would never trust them to cook a steak if they screw up a burger that badly.
__label__1	Only giving this place 1 star because that's the lowest i'm able to give. I wish i could give it 0 stars. By far the worst experience at a nail salon my family and i has ever had. We all left upset at how rude the staff was and how cheap our nails looked although we had paid wayyyy more than what we should have.  when we left our nails were still wet and some were messed up already by the time we got back in the car!! very very disappointed and will never go back!
__label__1	If you want ramen, you'll be happier with maruchan. Cabbage, an over fried egg, strips of dried chicken and a flavorless broth and noodles with corn. I was really disappointed. A+ delivery guy though.
__label__1	Very frustrated with my experience today. Our waitress was not attentive whatsoever and barely checked on us during our dining experience. I understand that you guys might be short staffed but today was ridiculous. The waitress should have communicated if she was overwhelmed and if we should expect service to be slower. I will not be coming back to this location ever again.
__label__1	I paid 20$ for a 16 inch tuna sandwich with bacon and avocado.  Where is the avocado.  Why did this happen.  When did this begin? Is this a forever change?  If I'm going to be spending money for Jimmy John to safari hunt elephants, it's the least his minimum wage workers can do.
__label__1	Very disappointed with Sears appliances. Purchased an Ultra Wash Dishwasher with the push button front control panel on 3/5//11, on 6/12/13 the control panel cracked and had to be replaced for $282.75. The Sears technician told me that Sears was aware of this problem with this model. Called Sears Corporate, Customer Service, and they refused to do anything, out of warranty. Today this has happened again, not even a year has passed. I have purchased Sears products my entire life, what a disappointment.
__label__1	In case anyone was wondering how this ended up - go figure, I sent them my info and they never called! Guess it's true that fish rot from the head down.
__label__1	Don't be fooled by their advertisements of happy hour specials. It is only applicable if you are sitting on the sidewalk. Not the patio or inside the restaurant.
__label__1	Came here on a Saturday afternoon with 2 friends for lunch. We sat at the bar. My mimosas were $8!!!!! Sooooooo overpriced. You can go anywhere else in town and find $2 mimosas on the weekend. The bartender was a girl and she seemed extremely nervous and had no personality. I got French toast. The bread was a millimeter thick and basically raw. Really a boring place that doesn't seem to have anything going for it.
__label__1	"All I can say is, never will I walk in here again. Nashville needs to step it up on style and class when it comes to a so-called ""Wine Bistro""."
__label__1	My bf booked this hotel for my bday we got the blue lagoon , a little old looking but it was ok , 5 am I woke up to bed begs biting the crap out of my arm I called the front desk and told them they gave me a refund I was so scared I was gonna bring a bedbug home smh never again
__label__1	These apartments are so ghetto. I don't know what happened during pandemic but their quality of residence went down with their low rent baiting! Apartments smell like weed and meth. This place is becoming like East Nashville!
__label__1	DO NOT GO TO THIS RESTAURANT!!!!! Large piece of glass in my friend's cup. And a fly in another drink.
__label__1	"Gross establishment from the outside and inside. Terrible location. Poor professionalism and customer service. Showed up five mins prior to my ""scheduled"" appt. and waited 35 mins without even being taken care of, so left. No apology given from the staff either - I'm at a loss of words for this place. DO NOT go here if you are contemplating - not worth the trip, save your gas money. #filthy #poorselection"
__label__1	This place was very good when they first opened, the must have gotten a new cook my husband and I ordered food on Sunday ( same chicken we always order ) it was very greasy and unflavored. Also the you g men that checks out and takes orders is very rude !
__label__1	"I came with a friend and was treated poorly.  Once seated we waited for almost an hour for our food, and was told they had ""forgot"" to put in our order, all the while others arriving were waited on and served promptly.  When the food arrived, it was barely worth half the price we paid - $20 for a basic sandwich that tasted like I could have bought it pre-packaged at a grocery store.  There is a definite whiff of classist treatment at this almost all white establishment."
__label__1	This used to be good Chinese takeout, but over the last year the quality has plummeted.  We got lo mein yesterday that went into the garbage can after one bite. It tasted like it had been made three days ago.
__label__1	Had the burrito special for Wednesday.  Ordered with chipotle chicken.  Burrito arrived artic cold and the wrap tasted like rancid oil.  No chicken at all.  IMPORTANT!  No sodas available.  No water available unless you buy bottled water.  They have no idea when these beverages will be available again.
__label__1	Worst food EVER, accompanied by the most ignorant staff EVER!!!  Trash can overflowing!!!  I would rather starve then eat there again!  $18 for four tacos, rude service, and a filthy atmosphere!!!  No thanks!
__label__1	Scum bags I've ordered from them for years, ordered a large and delivered a small, denied it and still charged me, low life pizza place never again
__label__1	I got off of an 11 hour shift that kicked my butt the entire time around 1:50 am. I was able to make it to this place to get some beer by 1:55 and the dude working refused to sell it to me. I assume he didn't want to do anything with his tills so it was easier to deny my business. If you guys are open until 2 you should sell things until 2. Thanks dudes, won't be back.
__label__1	"We were told that the cook was ""not used to cooking"" so there's that.  Half of my cinnamon roll French toast was actually cooked and the other two rolls (which came out five minutes later) were simply put through the toaster (what?!) Those appetizers we ordered were about to come out AFTER our meals soooo we definitely had to ask to cancel those. Thumbs down. Never again."
__label__1	They will without a doubt get your order wrong. If your going through the drive through make sure to check your order
__label__1	I sat there and waited for an order they already had ready. Employees don't look groomed .. I really can't even explain it. My donuts weren't fresh at all. They were hard and there was a hair on my sandwich. Never again!
__label__1	This location is convenient due to proximity to my house but last two pharmacy visits have been subpar service to put it kindly. Apparently the kings highway location receives more prescription requests they can handle - not sure if more staff would help or not as existing staff does not seem super busy but their attitudes certainly convey a stressed atmosphere esp when they try to avoid making eye contact with you and have curt tone when you question why it is taking longer then the 10-20 min stated when I got here. Currently going on 40 minutes waiting for prescription that was sent over electronically 2 hours ago?!?!?
__label__1	The service here is absolutely horrible.  There were more staff than customers at 4:30 on a Thursday and no one bothered to come to our table to ask for our order until we got up and requested it 15 min after being seated.  Take your money to a place that actually cares about their customers
__label__1	"Great location if you are planning on visiting Fort De Soto Park but the approximate of the restaurant with live loud music ruined my stay here. If you are planning to stay i this hotel, make sure to Do Not over pay for the marina/pools side as this will result in loud music being played until 10PM from the restaurant next door. Hence the 1 star review from me. Front desk never mentioned this before checking in. Loud music was played during my Thursday and Friday night stay. I believe that weekend nights are even worse!!! 

Stay away from marina/pool side rooms if you are looking for quiet nights!"
__label__1	"The worst Turkey burger I ever ate -- and I spent 10 bucks for it!  Zero stars... My friend said the Wellington beef burger was OK.  Not worth it! The owner gave me a coupon for 2 ""beef"" burgers for next time because he said the beef is good!  DUH!  ad no choice but to post one star so my post would appear!"
__label__1	I have no idea how this place has a good rating. We went here for lunch today, waiter was nice, atmosphere seemed ok but then after a 30 minute wait, they finally refilled our chips. Never refilled our drinks. Delivered 3 of our 5 meals wrong, fixed 2 eventually and the 3rd was never brought back/fixed. Try anywhere else but here.
__label__1	Figured I'd give this place another chance, the day before Christmas. Two people did my express nails that took 2.5 hours. Pedi was ok, hurt a little. Mani nails are fully chipped less than 24 hours later & I have barely used my hands to do anything. So sad. To add, a week later & my finger was still incredibly sore. I got paronychia confirmed at an emergency care center and had to have my finger lanced & went on meds NOT fun!
__label__1	"Worst Pizza. We ordered the New Yorker and the Philly. The New Yorker was an overlooked dough ball  with barely no sauce and little cheese. The Philly was pretty much the same except it was loaded with onions. Much better options in the area. 

If you want true brick oven pizza try Stella in Philadelphia!!"
__label__1	DON'T GO HERE!! If you are thinking about going here don't, join another one. For what they offer and how dirty it is, it is a waste of your money. The cancellation fee is ridiculous. The machinery is always broken, it is always dirty, smells weird, small gym, doesn't offer much classes, and the workers here are rude. Never at the front desk. I joined planet fitness and love it. So much cleaner, cheaper, employees are friendly, and more machinery to use!
__label__1	This place was awful. They are trying to make a classy resturant work in Wesley Chapel and that's impossible. The menu had a very small selection to choose from & what they did have, was way over priced. When we got our food, the bread to my Cuban was extremely soggy and the fries were ice cold. They would have been better off leaving it as Winner's. the only good thing about going to this place tonight was I now know where to never go again.
__label__1	"By far the worse McDonald's. Complaining doesn't matter. It's dirty and the workers don't want to work. Ice cream machine down means they don't want to clean it.  Easier being ""broken"". All orders take forever and are always wrong."
__label__1	The worst sushi I have ever had! I ordered a rainbow bowl and they were out of sashimi. Only give me a little bit of sashimi on top and the bowl weren't even half full! I am a girl who doesn't eat much, but the amount of food they gave me didn't even make me full! The food wasn't  good at all either! I will never come back to this place EVER again! If you are looking for some place to have good sushi, do NOT come here!
__label__1	Overpriced and all the glassware is sitting over the racks of clothes so you have to fight all the ladies planting themselves in the rows of clothes.  Not impressed at all and I've been in about 30 or more antique, thrift and flea markets in the last 2 weeks.
__label__1	We were hungry and it was close to our hotel. We ordered the poke tacos, baby kale salad with chicken, and two rolls (wasabi roll and one of their a raw tuna roll). The nicest way to put it, everything was tasteless. The cabbage and kale in the salad were rotting and wilted. It looks like they opened some old bag of Macdonald's salad and dumped a handful on the plate and added cooked chicken. The rolls was disappointing too. What a disappointment!
__label__1	"The service here is not good. Waited over 55 minutes when told the wait would be 30 minutes for two cheesesteaks and fries. The fries were ice cold and when I asked how long hot fries would  be the cook said ""probably another 35 minutes"" like I doubt fries take that long to cook when you just ppl hot fries on someone else's order that is picking up after me."
__label__1	When spending over $300 bucks on dinner for two, I would expect a little more quality than this place offered.  However, I was quite underwhelmed by the mediocre quality of my dinner.  Portions are obnoxiously small, and the food is quite unremarkable.  The atmosphere was also quite noisy.  With all of the great restaurants in the Clayton area, do yourself a favor and go somewhere else.  This place is way overpriced and the quality was disappointing.
__label__1	If I could give no stars I would! The worst, most unreliable, and incompetent company I have ever dealt with. I cancelled my service and they showed up after not coming to my house for 6 WEEKS while my new cleaner was there, WHAT? Who the hell is running this company? Please save yourself money, don't use them, EVER!!!
__label__1	Awful food. Avoid this place if you can. General Tso's was cold, as was the sauce and the lo mein was in one big block. Had to exert serious force just to get some strands of noodle out. Delivery driver was rude. Nice free delivery, but there's so many better options for chinese food. Forget this place.
__label__1	Bad place with bad business! My bike had some damage to one side of the tank and it took 3 MONTHS to paint. Then the cost increased by $600!!
__label__1	Terrible. Just terrible. Terrible service and food. Eat cold pizza from your frig instead of coming here. Not worth your time or money.
__label__1	Do not believe any advertised price for items at these stores. They play to many games. read the small print false advertising big time.
__label__1	We have been in carol house several times, and every time we are greeted by an associate, which is great. When we tell him/her we are just browsing they proceed to stalk us through the store, like we are going to pick up and carry out a three piece sectional. I know it's just because they want to make a sale, but frankly it makes me uncomfortable. Carol house would be much better off if they let their customers come to them. I felt very uncomfortable wandering around the store. Left after 20 minutes.
__label__1	rude dispatcher.  Wouldn't send a taxi to my location.   Said he could only put a call out on the radio and if any driver wanted to pick me up they'd come.  WTH?
__label__1	"Should have asked for a spoon . I didn't know smoothie king was offering bowls now . An actual bowl from Jamba Juice is blended better than this. The employee must have been high to give me an obviously not blended smoothie. 

For the manager, it was this afternoon. So you know, maybe actually train your employees?"
__label__1	As someone who frequents Total Wine often, this is the worst location I've ever been to. They have absolutely terrible customer service and I hate to say it, but I definitely felt discriminated against while in there. I waited on line behind a man who was NOT ID'd and when it was my turn the cashier asked me for my ID. She refused to sell me the wine I was trying to purchase because my boyfriend walked out of the store. I guess they pick and choose who they are going to ask. This establishment is a joke and I will never be returning.
__label__1	"My boyfriend and I went last weekend. We were staying at GSR... DJ sucked. Sound was horrible. 

I saw a bunch of girls that were so drunk that they were falling over. I saw one girl nearly puke on the dance floor. Admittedly, each individual is accountable for their alcohol consumption but it left me wondering if the bartenders don't know when to cut off customers and why wasn't security monitoring the crowd. 

We won't be back."
__label__1	Took too long to wait and turned out to mine was mistakenly taken by someone else. Then food is cold. Really bad experience.
__label__1	"Food was mediocre at best. The wait was an additional hour than expected AND we had a reservation. The service was poor. Very poor. We ordered 2 malts and 4 shakes. We asked what was what and the waitress replied ""I don't know"" and left it at that. We were still charged extra. Another server was just plain rude to us. 
Not a good experience at all."
__label__1	Run Away! I ordered the Carne Fries, meat was dry left out all day and fries was soaked in oil.  First time i thought it was just a fluke so i went again about 2 weeks later out of laziness and it was terrible again.  How do you mess up carne and fries i dont know but this place did twice.  I threw both plates in the trash and just swallowed the $15 oh well you live and you learn.
__label__1	Definitely not like it used to be. I ordered the whiskey river burger with onion rings. The onion rings were burned and should have never left the kitchen that way. I sent them back and they were returned the same way. The burger comes with bbq sauce which mine did not have. I was not informed that my substitute for fries were $2.49.  I will not be returning here.
__label__1	"What a chaos (!!!). 
Untrained staff. Invisible management. 
There weren't any napkins...
The star goes to the security guard, who has been essential today to make sure that this business operates efficiently to maximize profits."
__label__1	I've heard so much about the roast beef sandwiches here, we finally decided to give the place a try. I wonder if my wife and are the only ones who ever got sandwiches that were filled with fat and gristle. We were hugely disappointed. We could have made another sandwich with the fat and gristle that was taken off the 2 we ordered. We each had a half sandwich that was edible meat. Maybe we just got there on an off day. Probably won't go back.
__label__1	"I thought for the location this Bank of America was going to give me some decent service
Just moved from nyc and I've dealt with pretty crappy customer service 
But this branch really made me feel like I was not welcomed nor did they care to help me
Not going to mention names but if you can't do something simple for me just say it don't direct me to another bank and make me look stupid 
So unprofessional and a waste of my time."
__label__1	Gave one star because I had to, my condo building has a contract with them through the association, cable & internet stop working at least once a day and I'm lucky if it comes back on when it goes out, I've never seen such trouble with cable before awful just awful, I rent but if I owned I'd go through another company for internet and just use Hulu and Netflix.
__label__1	The owner asked me to send my email in private message so she could make it right. That was a week ago. I've seen or heard nothing since.
__label__1	Customer service is key. Pat doesn't get it. There are many other barbers in town that will make you feel welcome.  A simple hi...how are you? Maybe even a smile. It goes a long way. I haven't been to your shop in over a year and I'm still pissed off about your customer service.
__label__1	"Michael was a nice guy that seemed to think we had the loan in the bag pending me place down $435 for an appraisal, so they hired valuetrust solutions in Kansas to send a guy to my place.
 The Appraiser (lockhart), was a blooming idiot, he had been doing appraisals I think he said for more than 20 years, but did not know that proposed construction could not be deducted but could be added, (HUD Appraisal rule 4.2), thus I got a low-ball appraisal.
 Save you money go elsewhere. 
Robb"
__label__1	"I cannot express my distaste for this restaurant enough.
I went there with a group of friends, and when we received our bill at the end it was a bungled mess.
Maybe that would have been excusable if the food wasn't so terrible that it made me sick, and my boyfriend even sicker (read: his stomach thoroughly rebelled later that evening)."
__label__1	Servers were unwelcoming and slow. We ordered an appetizer that never came and was not acknowledged. There was only one other group at bar other than us with 2 bartenders . When my husband had his empty wine glass sitting there for 20 minutes the bartender said are you ok in a condescending tone . Ummm maybe ask he if wants another drink since it's a bar! I would never go back here
__label__1	"I went for the first time and I will never return. I got charged for two bagels when I only ordered one and when I got home realized I had gotten the wrong order. When I returned, I only got refunded for one bagel and they wouldn't make me the correct one. So essentially I paid for a bagel and left with nothing.

The bagel I did get was tiny and I could have eaten three. Overall, terrible customer service and the bagels are minuscule."
__label__1	Service is okay it's everything you would expect from a chinese buffet.  Prices are fair  for what you get.  One plus was they had full size steamed blue crabs when i went and that was great!  It's a great place to be when you need a variety of quick fix chinese food.
__label__1	"I want to warn anyone considering this company.  The tech Adi came out, told me a bunch of false information that was later discovered and had me enter a contract on false pretenses.

Everything from service to amount was untrue.  No apology or accountability from this company and I am considering legal action as their methods are predatory and based again on the hook and sinker approach.

To any prospective customers-proceed with extreme caution."
__label__1	We have a 5 year warranty on on coach, every year their suppose to fix the little things that go wrong. This year they had our coach 6 weeks and we got nothing fixed and had to bring it back cause the auto leveling system was not working. The people that work there don't have time for any kind of service. Their rude and never pick up the phone to do anything. Save yourself the headache and go somewhere else!
__label__1	"I had booked for my event back in march for my event June 3, 2017 and they sent me a reminder email last week  and they NEVER SHOWED UP!!!   I called and it went to voicemail   I emailed and no one has responded back 
Beyond disappointed !!   I would like a full REFUND"
__label__1	My review is to strongly warn yell and scream to anyone listening. Do not use auto repair services with wesley chapel nissan. After more than 2 months of repairs and having them guessing whats wrong with my car. My insurance company spent 4000 and I still have to another spend 3000 on a new engine. I was lied to on several occasions along with insurance adjusters. They have horrible customer service. Make sure get everything quoted in writing. Cant wait to see them in court.
__label__1	Worse branch ever. Be prepared to wait at the drive thru a minimum of 20 minutes. They will make the genius call to have ONE teller working at lunchtime on a Friday. Also- always check your deposit slips. They seem to have a habit of keying in the wrong amounts.
__label__1	The food here tasted great, but after getting home I became very sick. This is unfortunate because like I said, it was good food, but beware of the sushi!
__label__1	Where to begin, I stopped by in the morning around 6:00am and all the lights are in and it's closed with no posted hours. Closed permanently, who knows?? I decide to swing back by on my way home and they're open but no very welcoming. I tell them I'm going to sit at the bar, their response is it's only for employees! WTF really?!?!? I told them I'd take my business elsewhere. I'm sorry you fucked up, I leave really, really big tips.
__label__1	"So i ordered soup on Monday for my lunch-- it was good.  I just came from there again, there were no potatos, or sausages in my soup. The broth was OILY as heck and they didn't give me bread sticks.  I felt veryyyyy sick after eating it.  The wait staff was pretty bummy as well ( no please or thank you).  I won't be returning. 

BTW

The only reason i'm giving it one star is because the soup was good on Monday, Whatever though."
__label__1	"Cut my neck up. 
Old used razor 
Avoid. 
They might take care of their family and ""celebs"" but for an average person wanting to look fresh, I left with neck wounds and a regular haircut, nothing to get hyped about. 

Never coming back again."
__label__1	I went to the restaurant in the back. The food was unbearably spicy hot even though I specifically asked for mild. I will not go back here again or recommend it to anyone. This is often my peeve with Indian restaurants, I like Indian food and have had excellent Indian food that is tolerable. It frustrates me that they only cater to people who have a high tolerance for heat.
__label__1	Horrible experience, courtesy (or lack of) from what appeared to be the owner. He will go out of his way to ruin your time, even if you aren't in his establishment anymore and you're on the beach. Definitely not ever returning or recommending this place to anyone.
__label__1	i had a/c trouble a while back and henderson sent out a tech that was the single most obnoxious contractor i have ever met...if it had not been 100 degrees i would have kicked him out of my house...literally kicked him...he cut his hand and washed the blood off in my kitchen sink, questioned me on my knowledge of a/c (what was i paying him for?), talked about the wonders of his 401k and asked me about mine...it was even worse than i describe here
__label__1	A burger without lettuce or tomatoes???? Talk about a chef who is totally obsessed about the taste of only a single ingredient, the meat? If you don't care about the big picture taste of the burger and are only into tasting one ingredient than this place is for you. The fries are a bit skinny. Lot of crust, not much inside. I guess it saves them time cooking and money. I was also told that some people bring their own lettuce and tomatoes in a ziplock bag! How convenient!
__label__1	Went with my family once and was amazing the first time around and had no complaints while waiting in the barefoot bar. Next time we went I ordered the jumbo shrimp and the rice first came out dry and vegetables were okay. Woke up in the middle of the night with horrible food poisoning knowing it is from the shrimp. I know there's a risk when eating fish but have never had anything like this happen before. Won't be coming back unless for the barefoot bar for drinks.
__label__1	Car not cleaned well, nasty crowded waiting room, money missing from console. Owner yells at customers.
__label__1	"Just got 'the works"". Got back in the car and they clearly had not touched the dashboard. Still dusty. Zero difference between any levels if their car washes. Save your money. And this after the guy there tried to sell me $200 in coupons"
__label__1	Went here to get 4 new tires after picking it up it was missing a lug nut on one tire.  They said it was no big deal and sent me on my way.  I had to go elsewhere to get another lug nut installed.  Based on my review and others should raise a red flag.
__label__1	Had several issues with Nobu over the past few months.  Bad lettuce, incorrect order and extremely long wait times.  Today was the final straw.  Called an order in at 4:57 and was told 15-20 minutes ... Was still waiting for my order at 5:55.  The owner doesn't seem to care, which is unfortunate.
__label__1	Last visit here on a Sunday and waited insanely long for my order and vowed to not come back again. Had a gift card and decided to give it another try. My flatbread sandwich was so oily it was drippy everywhere. Mac and cheese was mediocre. To top it off they sold us a brownie hard as a rock. When we complained, they returned with another brownie equally stale. We won't be back.
__label__1	Everything is exactly the same. I just thought I would give them another shot since I had 45 minutes to wait for a bus. Not one driver wanted to act like he knew where I live unless I paid them $20. I called the number on the side of the car and they said that they are independent drivers that they have no responsibility over. Do not use County Cab Quaker city cab. Do not use Quaker city County Cab.
__label__1	BAD BAD BAD. Took more than 2 hours for one pizza. Server Tawnni was rude. Phone orders took priority than dine ins. PLEASE DONT COME HERE FOR DINE IN. Worst place ever!
__label__1	Tried to order a Baja blast at the 2nd window and this kid tells me I have to go through the drive through TWICE. Has to RECORD dumbest shit I have ever heard.
__label__1	We went there Tuesday night granted it was 830 they closed at 9 but right away they were not refilling things at 9 they pulled everything and started turning lights off and mopping. I was not a happy camper.  I would have rather them to tell me they were closing then to make our dining experience so bad!
__label__1	This was my first time trying Yona Redz and while I was very excited to try their food, I was left disappointed. The special cost about $15 for three tacos and 1 consume. The tacos were okay but the consume was not good at all. It tasted very watered down with no flavor. The online pictures made it appear rich and flavorful but it looked nothing like the online posts. We ordered 5 consumes and no one was able to eat it.
__label__1	Went in for a pedicures, felt as though they were in hurry. I could see the polish start to wrinkle after he applied the top coat. We we went to pay my friend was charged 27 dollars and I was charged 30 for the same service with out an explanation.  I didn't ask,  I felt so awkward upon paying, I just wanted to leave.
__label__1	Tons of hidden nasty ingredients. If you have a food allergy or are on a medical diet they do not care about you at all. You can tell them no sauce, no extras, nothing and they will ignore it. Green tea isn't just green tea. It's green colored sugar water with fake ginger in it. Salad comes with sugar sauce slathered all over it. The fish was the only thing they couldn't ruin and even that was meh. If this business doesn't take its customer's health seriously don't expect them to make quality food.
__label__1	"In what universe are these ""fajitas"" worth $27?"" 2 5"" flour tortillas, 1/4 cup rice, 1/4 beans, eight shrimp, a smattering of over cooked onions and peppers. Seasoning must have been an added extra cause I didn't get any. $27. Cool."
__label__1	We have driven by here many times traveling down I64 and always wondered how they managed to stay open with only a handful of cars in the parking lot. So we finally decided to try them out. We found the answer to our questions. The reason for so few cars is mediocre food and incompetent service. The only reason they are still open is the exorbitant prices.
__label__1	Place is terrible. Crazy expensive for subpar products. They have things that you get at Walmart at Locale Market prices. Absolutely absurd. This place does not have quality product, environment or service that warrants this. The only thing that they probably use to justify these exaggerated prices is the location. Something else needs to move in.
__label__1	"Giving this place one star for the view and location. It's nice if your visiting the pier to just walk here and eat however, the food is comparable to Chili's in my opinion. Nothing special. Seafood is terrible. Had family in from New Orleans they said worst oysters they have ever had. 

Best bet, walk a little bit and go to Frescos. It's worth the wait and walk. 

This is more of a tourist trap but if your going just for apps and drinks it will do."
__label__1	Usually my favorite pizza, buuuut not today when I bit into my awesome slice of heaven only to discover someone's hair!! Yep .. baked right in. Yuck!! Bon-appetite!
__label__1	I was very disappointed! My appetizer was very undercooked, the trout was so dry and overcooked and the service was unprofessional. The second and third course was delivered without us having the proper silverware.  I expected higher quality overall.  The patio was very pretty but that's about all that place has to offer!
__label__1	This car wash is A piece of shit for 24 hours, spent $15 and then three dollars for a tire shine.... they had no receipts, and nobody on staff so call. This your typical ghetto car wash,No stars book to post this I had to put one
__label__1	Terrible customer service. Arrogant managers. Low ball trade offers.  Texted and called the night before.  Called day of meeting. Traveled 3+ hrs to try to make a deal. Nobody knew who I was, communication was terrible.  Trade offer was $2k less than any other dealership in the area.  Total waste of time.  Stay away.
__label__1	This place is so poorly managed. How can you have a salad place with no topping. They ran out of most toppings before 6:00 pm. Figure it out. All I wanted was a salad and you slapdicks ruined that for me. Never coming back.
__label__1	Worst car wash ever! Their machine ripped the wiper arm off of my disabled mothers car and they did not own up or fix it. She had to pay $200+ out of her limited income to get it replaced. Do not recommend this crappy place
__label__1	Horrible food! Pricey! Service was very bad! Second time there and to be honest last time! There should be better places sound there!
__label__1	Customer service non-existent. I stood around the microwaves waiting for someone to acknowledge me but everyone was too busy socializing nearby. When I finally decided to buy something, I carried it to the front by myself with no one offering to help. Overall a very annoying experience. Reminded me why I prefer to shop online.
__label__1	"I ordered a veggie stromboli and fried mushrooms with cheese whiz. Everything was so terrible that I have a hard time believing that anyone who works here is eating their food. The cheese whiz was so salty it was inedible (and I really like salt). The inside of the stromboli was sweet in a really unfortunate way. I would've just thrown the whole thing away if I hadn't been so hungry/exhausted. I ended up scraping out the entire filling and just eating the crust. 

I will never eat here again."
__label__1	This place over charged my meal.  I order a 2 pc grilled for 5.99 the cashier charged me 9.99. When I called her out on it she acted like she did nothing wrong.  No apology, called the manager over and she refunded me $2. This place has gone down hill, I do not recommend anyone to go to this place.
__label__1	I wouldn't give this business any stars.  Minimal hours and rude personnel.  I now refuse to go there, even when they happen to be open.  I've been through the drive-through, thinking I got lucky, and not once has anyone been friendly.  I will not go back.
__label__1	"Worst! In late 2011 we called these guys, they came out laid a ""New roof"" it took them 4 times out as the roof kept leaking, here we are 18  months later and the roof is leaking!!  I've tried to get a hold of them to hold them to their 10 year guarantee, to findmy number is blocked. These guys are a huge rip off! We paid them over $5000 and now have to hire a new company.....buyer beware!"
__label__1	Made reservations for outside seating for 8:30, showed up at 8:25 checked in and was informed that there were no tables available outside and that reservations don't actually guarantee a seat..... ummmm that's what I thought a reservation actually did...
__label__1	"Made an appointment based on my service contract. After time passed I called and they had no record of my appointment. When the technician came he told me I needed new underhouse piping and it would be $1,300 and I would get a call the next day to schedule the work. He then tried to sell me a new AC system. Next day no call so I called another AC company. They did a great job and charged me 35% less and did a quality and timely job. 
SKIP Superior as they are inferior and a rip off."
__label__1	Unfortunately, this is the only Jimmy Johns near my office. I ordered a un-wich through the drive thru. There was one piece of lettuce that is supposed to hold the entire sandwich together. It did not. It leaked all over my car, and there was no good way to eat it other than with utensils as NOTHING was holding it together. Maybe instead of being really fast, they need to work on making orders that people will actually eat.
__label__1	Would be much better if they fixed their return policy. I ordered $60 shoes that were too small and to return them, shipping was between $38-$128. It wasn't even worth it to return the shoes. Also it took a month to receive my shoes and then the return policy was that they have to receive my shoes in 2 weeks. Just be absolutely sure you're going to keep your item(s) if you order online.
__label__1	Servers great. Good food but not worth the price. Took quite a while to get food. Luke warm & out of many items.
__label__1	Dump!  Worthless dump!  Staff is worthless rude and dumb.  Rooms have no windows. Its a rat trap roach motel.  Mold mold mold.  Firetrap!
__label__1	"Luna's Jumps is a rip off. At the Arroyo Grande Strawberry Festival, we waited in line at over one hour for two different jumps and one we stood in line for over 2 hours. Don't buy more than $5 worth tickets you won't be able to use them. 

I get the no refund policy but when your people aren't vigilant about the time limits, it makes the wait times ridiculous and there is no incentive to move folks through the line. Totally took up way too much time and not worth"
__label__1	This place is the worst. I've been here about 20 times in the last year and I don't think they've gotten our order right once. Apparently it's really difficult to NOT put cheese on sandwiches (even when you write an order down and cook it yourself). Today the girl at the counter offered to just take the cheese off the sandwich. Unfortunately that won't work when the cheese is melted and somebody has a sensitivity or allergy. Today was my last time - they will never learn.
__label__1	When asked about a military discount, the replied they would never give a discount for those who volunteered for a job.  They were rude and the food is over-priced.
__label__1	This is not a restaurant.  They sell tamales at local Safeway's in the Tucson area.  Being from Texas, I suggest you save your money they're frozen garbage.
__label__1	The 1.5 overall rating is too generous.  I HATE dealing with Express Scripts but I am stuck with them due to my insurance carrier.  There is an issue with every prescription order and every time I call them I get a different story.  I called today to cancel one of my prescriptions from automatic refills to be told it wasn't on automatic refills.  I said, I am looking at my account online and it is on automatic refills.  I was able to cancel online but I HATE express scripts.
__label__1	If I could give this place 0 stars, I would. No matter how many chances I give them, they always mess up my order. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. The employees are EXTREMELY rude to everyone except other Indian customers.
__label__1	The employee that assisted me at this post office, Ray, was extremely rude and unprofessional. He spoke to my family & I in a way that no customer should be spoke to. I definitely will not be returning to this post office and I do not recommend this place to anyone!
__label__1	Went to pick up moving boxes which they said they sold when I called.  Came in, they said they had to check to see if they had medium boxes, which they did not.  So I had to get a size up, which I did not want, but was desperate to get stuff packed (nice way to up-sell) Then when I went to pay, they said they didn't take cash only debit or credit cards.  HELL no I don't provide my credit card or debit card to storage places, that's one to have have your identity stolen.  Walked out - empty handed.
__label__1	Tested on 01/03/2022. Test not received at lab until 01/07/2022 and still waiting on results, of course. Skip Walgreens and go to CVS or the health department if you need a COVID-19 test. This lab is unreliable and gives false claims regarding COVID-19 test results turnaround time.
__label__1	Ramen is just soy sauce soup. Salmon poke and lamb are really tasteless. Menu is small but seems to cover various types. Turns out nothing is done right. Expensive too. I feel i paid for the location and decorations but not food.
__label__1	So I ordered online from the Valencia location and when I came to pickup my order the guy looked at me in shock and told me he'd would have my order out. I then see him scramble through his online orders to find my order that hadn't even been looked at yet. Really?! What's the point in even having an on line order? I could have just called. This place is a joke...there sandwiches are ok but not good enough that I would forget this and come back.
__label__1	"Would love to review the food, had I gotten to eat. We sat for 20 minutes without anyone coming to our table. Got up to leave, let the host know and all she said was ""oh sorry"""
__label__1	Taylor is a grouch. Telling a Target employee how tired she is of making drinks as she is making drinks for customers. Sighed and rolled her eyes as another customer ordered a Frappuccino. If you hate your job, at least be discreet about it.
__label__1	"I received meds that I never Ok'd for delivery. I returned the medication directly to Express Scripts. I notified my credit card which had been charged for the medications and the charge was reversed, after contacting Express Scripts. Now I am receiving mailed billing noticeses for the meds that I returned. I have talked to 2 different 
""managers"" with no resolution.  I will never use Express Scripts again for any prescription deliveries. I urge others to do the same. This is a messed up company.
If i could have given a negative 1 Yelp rating I would have

Rich L"
__label__1	"Seated fairly quickly,  service was ok. Ordered a Hennessy on the rocks, was brought  Jack Daniel's.  Told server and she replaced it with the correct drink. Before I could get a sip of it, the hostess was moving a chair behind me to accommodate a wheelchair bound patron, and bumped into me and the drink spilled all over me and the table. Apologies from the server, but had to leave. I was wet and reeking of Hennessy.  Would I go back? NO

I left disappointed, and pissed."
__label__1	yesterday I went to buy the burts bees lip ，but unfortunately when I came home open the box ,the inside is empty. Too bad.
__label__1	I would give them a 0 if I could. I have dealt with Thompson in the past and had similar experiences, don't know why Toyota would be any different. I was going back and forth for 2 weeks trying to get warranty info. 2 weeks the salesman wouldn't give me a straight answer. The vehicle sold. Something that should've taken 2 mins to research took multiple emails, calls, and missed out on a vehicle that I had already pretty much worked a deal on. So frustrating.
__label__1	Very disappointed, very rude, terrible service. We sat for half an hour before getting any acknowledgement. Drinks took an hour to come out. We had to eventually had to bring our cards down to the bar to pay for a meal that 2.5 hours.
__label__1	Big bald guy who works there constantly tries to scam me out of money and is rude. Most everyone else there is nice but this guy seriously makes me drive 30 minutes to another McDonald's because he's such a prick. If you pull up to the drive through and see this guy ALWAYS ask for a receipt and count your change!
__label__1	This is not the worst restaurant I've ever eaten in but it's the worst for the money. They charge expensive prices for basically portions my 3 yr old grandson could have eaten and still would have been hungry. The asian pot roast beef rib meat was undercooked, the Jasmin rice was portioned approximately 2 spoonfuls, above all the food was so bland it was very disappointing. Save your money or get a better meal at ihop.
__label__1	Food is delicious but service always sucks !! ... I always asking the guys cooking to call my waiter/tress ... They never came to my table to check on me and they are sooo bad at being kind !! Dont come ... i am done with them too !
__label__1	Today will be our last from this Chili's, this is the third time we order takeout and get home half of our order isn't there. The food is on the slip but not in the bag. How hard is it to check your order for correctness. We won't be back
__label__1	Ordered jeans and coat from catalogue.  Jeans were size I ordered, but too large.  Returned jeans and asked for one size smaller. Used return form and address that they provided with my order.  No new jeans came.  Emailed customer service.  I was told that address was from previous owner of company and please have it forwarded to new address.  Their mistake and I am supposed  to spend  my time fixing it?  No idea how to have a delivered package forwarded.  Good company would  have seen my frequent purchase history and just sent me the new jeans.  I will never buy another product from Territory Ahead.  Avoid them.
__label__1	I went with a friend yesterday and we both ordered the deluxe spa pedicure. My friend received all of the elements of the spa that were included, but I did not receive the massage, the mask, or exfoliation. When I pointed this out, I was told I had already received them and the lady begrudgingly patted some lotion onto my legs and told me to put my shoes on
__label__1	Rude customer service. Borderline discriminatory. Take your money elsewhere.
__label__1	This is BY FAR the worst facility and care that I have ever received. You are much better off going to a mimic clinic at CVS.
__label__1	For several years,  I have asked Nancy Alperin of Maxwell Realty in Philadelphia not to send unsolicited mail to my address.  She has continued to do so.  Many other people have reported this as well.  She's wasting her time and money as most of those who might want to sell their property would now never use Maxwell Realty.   She has not once called me to apologize or even to inform me that this annoying practice will cease -- which it hasn't.
__label__1	This is definitely the worst Mexican food I have ever eaten. The enchilada sauce is from a can! Poor quality food and not authentic. The service is horrible. I gave it a couple chances and each time it was awful.
__label__1	Just left this DD and decided not to get my coffee and donut since the employee who came out of thE bathroom before I could go in DID NOT WASH her HANDS 2/6/20.
__label__1	Don't know when it changed hands but I am really shocked that they are letting the new owner/management operate under the same name. Doesn't appear they are using the same crêpe batter recipe. They have limited  options now and the incredible French press coffee is gone and replaced with a k-cup brewer. I was extremely disappointed. This used to be a top rated incredible crêpe bar, well worth the higher price and long wait for several years. No line now but same pricing. No repeat customers now. Very sad.
__label__1	"Honestly, I understand that you are busy, but your employee Karen (real name) is by far the worst thing I've come across in years. And that includes covid. I asked a simple question, and she yelled ""I don't know!"" And then told me to move. Really? Then proceeded to scream ""have a nice day"". The manager apologized, but looked confused on how to handle this witch. She made my daughter uncomfortable as she yelled at us. The service at this frys is no longer worth it. It's really gone downhill."
__label__1	I would give negative stars if I could. The food isn't spectacular but the guy working  there not sure if he is the owner or what is real jerk. Listen if you want to keep customers how about you check your attitude and be a kind person. God knows how many people will never go back because of him! Support a business that has nice owners go anywhere else!!
__label__1	"Here at 650AM for a 700AM appt and it looks like a circus. There is a woman already upset that no one had talked to her and she'd been here 15 minutes. Purchased a car here less than 2 months ago and completely  bummed we have to get it serviced here for the life of this warranty.  
***the lady we are working with is great****"
__label__1	"I am EXTREMELY disappointed. I came in and was told it would be a 25 or less minute wait and waited an hour. After having multiple people seated before us who DID NOT have reservations, it was very upsetting. I rather the establishment be HONEST with their customers than lie about a wait time. Once seated, we told our waiter we had been waiting for some time and he could not have cared less. 
This place honestly SUCKED tonight. Won't be back!!!"
__label__1	Place was nice inside but never got a chance to order any food, got seated by the the waiter which never came and got a drink order and the place was not busy either so i went up to the counter where the waiter was just STANDING there and ask what I needed to do so we could get a drink and order and he told me he had been to busy!! REALLY we sat for 20 minutes and never got approached.
__label__1	Worst Thai food I've had in the states.  Food was sweet and had no authentic flavor to it.  And it was completely over priced.  Don't waste your time here.
__label__1	Had an appointment at 8:30 am.  I showed up and signed in at 8:30,  was called to fill in some paperwork 20 minutes later and by 9:30 was still waiting.  I have a life and my time has value, I got my refund and left.  When explaining that I had to leave the clerks were not the least surprised I had waited an hour with no service.  Seems like this is their game plan, use the airline service model and overbook.
__label__1	DO NOT REGISTER HERE!!! We placed our order around Thanksgiving and were charged in full. It is now July and we have yet to receive one item. I understand the nature of fine china, international shipping, and that things go on back order (all excuses given to us by Manor Home & Gift) but this is completely unacceptable and the worst customer service I have ever experienced. At this point, the best solution is the cut all ties with Manor and order direct from the brands.
__label__1	I do not recommend at all. I ordered fries and a salad. The waitress said both area substantial amount. The waitress then clarified that you get 6oz of salad for a $6 salad and 5 oz of fries for $5 worth of fries. When I talked to the manager he was unaccommodating and told me that the 15 fries (I counted) was all he could give me and he would have to charge extra for any more. Ridiculous waste of money. The fries weren't even tasty after all of that. Don't waste your money here.
__label__1	I'm done with your store/chain.  I have used your store to buy my hunting gear for years, but not anymore.  You don't care about your customer base, only how you look for the media.  Pulling guns from the shelves and cancelling prepaid orders just for the sake of media attention is a poor decision.  You don't care about the customers who have been loyal to you.  I hope you go out of business.  All of my money will be spent elsewhere.
__label__1	Ordered delivery. Took an hour and 45 minutes and after calling, the woman who answered the phone was extremely rude and probably shouldn't have a job in which she interacts with other humans. Pizza sucked. Don't waste your time
__label__1	Went to the buffet. Not crowded at all and therefore the food was OLD. The salad bar looked sparse. Desserts were OK.
__label__1	The manager Chrissy B is lazy, and doesn't follow or make sure her employees follow the laws set by the health code. If you don't want her slimy fingers on your food then eat some where else.
__label__1	I got the odometer fixed and the bulbs on the cluster replaced i did it myself and i did not have to go to the dealer to fix it.
__label__1	"My wake call was Tucson Police banging on doors, saying come out with your hands up. 
 My room had no washcloths. I went to the front desk and asked for some. I was given 1 and told it was the only one he had. My allegedly non-smoking room smells of old smoke. The curtain has a large rip in it.
 Factor the hotel management can not control definite smell of marijuana in the hall."
__label__1	Took our 3 month puppy in for grooming and got turned away because his vaccine record said he hadn't gotten his Parvo vaccine. On the paperwork it said he had gotten his DHPP which includes Parvo. Really complete lack of knowledge is horrifying.
__label__1	Terrible salespeople pointing out women's flaws trying to sell this terrible product. It's awful when can't walk down the street without feeling anxiety as you try to rush by these jerks before they can insult you. I was told my lines under my eyes need help. Seriously, this kind of sales tactics should be illegal. I now cross the street just to avoid them. Don't waste your money on these rude people.
__label__1	Incompetent and unprofessional. Purchased 3 tires, two were installed backwards and they had to correct. Then they left a sensor on that was off upon my arrival (documented by the Dodge dealer and myself) and blamed it on me! It was nuts. They were confrontational and childish. Never will return and will share my story with my contacts. Stay away, they are in over their heads!
__label__1	Food looked and smelled amazing.  After seeing the pics on Yelp I was dying to come here, so I came here for my birthday.  No liquor license, so no alcohol at all.  After waiting for our food for an hour after we ordered and a half, our waitress asked if we still wanted our food?? What the hell?? I was dying to try that cast iron pig of crab and whatnot....so obviously we said yes, then 2 hours and 45 minutes after ordering our food still was not there, so we walked out. Worst service of all time.
__label__1	Their service is terrible! I had a 10:30 appt for an oil change and sat in line for 30 mins before being taken care of, the. I sat in the waiting area for 2 hours for something that literally takes 15 mins!! This is unacceptable, not to mention I drove 20 minutes to get here! I could've saved my whole morning and went to Jiffy Lube! No one even came to talk to me to tell me they were running behind. I had to ask numerous times!
__label__1	Called for service for a brand new 2021 Lincoln Aviator purchased a few months ago. Car has transmission issues. Called two days ago and left messages with service desk but no call back. Can't even speak with a real person. Shameful customer service.
__label__1	The sauce on my sandwich tasted awful. Called the manager or a woman named Tierra asking if I brought it back if she could make me another sandwich and leave the nasty sauce off this time. She said no! I have been eating subway my whole life and I always get the southwest chipotle sauce in my sub, this was awful today! I am calling corporate and letting them know about my experience. Won't be back to this location again. I should have listened to my neighbors who also dont go to that store anymore.
__label__1	Don't sign up to this gym. I have relocated to another state without an edge gym. They will not let me cancel my membership even though it is in their policy that if you relocate you can cancel. As I do not have the proof they require. They are complete snakes
__label__1	"When did Dreamer's Coffee House close? Heartbreaking. 

I'm going to miss their coffee milkshakes. The new place that took over lacks the same charm and deliciousness as its previous occupant."
__label__1	"I have received quality care overall. But if you rely on disability insurance payments in a timely manner, you're screwed. What's worse is after dozens of phone calls, and my ex telling them he's not leaving until my forms were completed, only an operator has tried to help and I have never been able to connect with anyone administrative. I heard a woman go to the counter after being mistreated by staff & requested a manager. She was told that the person ""went home"". She stated she would talk to the doctor. The reply - I quote ""The Doctors Don't Care""."
__label__1	Decided to get a take out order, picked up when they requested  me to.  Ordered ribs and shrimp, salad, potato skin.  Received only ribs, fries, potato skins were all ice cold.  Salad no dressing, just lettuce.  Get there they make me wait 15 minutes, bring out the condiments they forgot, mind you they took my order back.  So I am waiting 45 minutes still no food.  Horrible service.
__label__1	American Airlines are not American at all! Only Communist crooks would operate such a pathetic airline! They take your money and could care less about how they decieved you, ruined your day, lost your luggage, lost wages, or didn't make it in time to see a loved one before they died! They don't care about repeat service. Plain evil!
__label__1	"So now you must have a physical copy of your prescription just to enter? So, rude and disrespectful- I'm in awe.
Hey, thanks for helping me decide if I'm going to maintain my second insurance coverage through you!  Canceled and not going back l'd rather put a couple beer bottle bottoms on my eyes for sunglasses than ever walk into your shop with your rude employees ever again."
__label__1	"This festival is nice from a foodie standpoint but in my opinion lacks some basic stuff

- 2 dollars for a small bottle of water is really expensive 
- parking on a saturday should be free downtown not 5 to 7 dollars
- while walking with my baby i almost tripped at two places . the walkaround is not well managed

I would revommend going to this festival if you are a foodie and you like dancing and  you do not have any kids below 5 years of age and dont mind wasting money in mineral water"
__label__1	This rooftop is overrated. Poor service and the Hype is not real or accommodating. Rooftop is Not worth the price. Will never come back.
__label__1	What a horrible nail salon. I'm pregnant and was struggling to take my shoe off, and nobody helped me. Also my nails begin to peel within a few days, & when I went back to get them fixed, they blamed me! Absolutely horrible customer service. I had to do half my manicure myself. Do not go here !!!
__label__1	The cheese wiz was good but the bread and meat less so. And the meat was bigger slices which I don't like as much, feels less integrated. So had to use hot peppers to make up for it. Though it was nice that they had free condiments available including those big juicy cherry peppers that I love. Was $1.5 more expensive than Jim's
__label__1	Wow the the owners statement that she didn't wane browsers in her store...amazing how people like her stay in business...very rude go in with your cash out and know what you want or get out...scarey
__label__1	Got the chocolate Cannoli and the one with pistachios and it was not good. We ate a bite and had to throw it out.
__label__1	One of the worst indian restaurants I have visited in the past year. Slow service, rude waiters, food I wouldn't serve my dog are amongst the pleasures you'll find at this local doghouse.
__label__1	Don't bother ordering thru this app. The business did not even have their tablet turned on.  Major fail.
__label__1	This is the second home record scam I've received in a week. What lowlife scum.
__label__1	DISGUSTING... I even returned the food, and was given the same crap again...8.00 for a salad it was GROSS... Never again...
__label__1	"Poor restaurant advertiser hours 10:30 and closed at 10:20. Had 8 guests so we'll take our $300.00 + some where else thank you very much!

Okay so we land at MafiaOza's and they Gladly seat us. What a better choice. Thanks"
__label__1	It's a Saturday night and they did not have the ingredients to make their signature drinks!! The food was cold( very cold) the waiter actually said your not the first table tonight to say that!!!  Really!!!
__label__1	"I have always avidly come here but after our last visit I won't be coming back in the foreseeable future. I had a party of six so we were expecting 18% percent gratuity. When the bill came and we calculated it, it turned out that we were all charged 27-35% in tips. When asked to correct this it took them an additional 30 minutes to fix the bill. Not only were we late to our party, not all of us were fully refunded. Seeing as there is many cheap sushi restaurants, they will be easily replaced. 

Shady, shady, shady"
__label__1	Ridiculously loud music, extremely packed (do NOT go on a Sat), and filthy changing rooms. When I say filthy, I am not exaggerating. In addition to regular dust and dirt, I found specks of blood!!!
__label__1	Horrible.  Shrimp was gritty, red beans and rice w/sausage was awful.  Beans old and cooked to soup, Polska kielbasa instead of andoulle was 3 inches long and cut in half for $12, one tiny scoop of rice.  Garlic toast was neither toasted nor garlic.  Waste of $$$.  Keep walking keep looking.
__label__1	Very disappointed! Found a 2in catapiller/ worm in my ratatouille crepe and they comped MY meal but not my husband. Then they offered to make me another one or I could pick something else. Then they said I could take something to go. Ah.. No thanks!!
__label__1	Terrible food, hard uncomfortable chairs and wine was underpoured. I'm a retired French trained chef and I will bet the hundred dollars spent on dinner for two this place is closed In less than a year. You can keep deleting my posts and I will keep reposting.
__label__1	"DO NOT PAY UNTIL THE JOB IS COMPLETE!!!

8 months, we are still left with an incomplete job. After multiple conversations with ownership, broken promises, and missed appointments, I am left with no option other than to open a civil suit. Even Hunter Douglas implies that The Blind Guys cause issues like this all the time. 

Do yourself a favor and steer clear of these incompetent retailers."
__label__1	I was very disappointed in the dessert/ice cream department.  Since it under new management the Special Ice Cream Sunday menu is no more.  I do not feel the need to go back here for dessert.  I have not tried sandwiches yet.
__label__1	It has been three months now since my daughters ear piercing and we are still having constant issues with the ear that was left bloody at the end of her service. It still ends up in a bloody crust probably once a week and just won't heal right. I have never had a worst service performed. I email the business after it happened and was completely ignored. I wouldn't recommend my worst enemy to go to this garbage piercing salon!
__label__1	Worst repairman, worst service, longest delay, and they make you pay upfront
__label__1	Honeygrow is definetly tasty, but this location stinks. A friend and I went to have lunch there, she got a salad, I got a stir fry. Her salad came within a reasonable time, I waited for over 30 mins to get my stir fry. I had to ask for it to go. Got back to the office and it was missing the shrimp. Over $12 for a noodle stir fry. What a joke.
__label__1	"ATTENTION DIABETICS:

The items that are labeled as something you can order with ""no sugar"" ARE NOT SUGAR FREE.

This clearly means they won't ADD sugar to the existing ingredients!

I ordered a ""no sugar"" green tea smoothie yesterday and about 20 minutes after drinking it I nearly passed out in the car. It was obviously LOADED with sugar. Very, VERY pissed off about it.

They should be CLEAR that ""no sugar"" means ""no additionally added sugar""!!!"
__label__1	Asked for fresas con cream and they didn't even put crema  vale verga el vato, when we first got there, it took the guy 15 minutes to take our order, charged 9 dollars for strawberries that aren't even fresh! Don't waste your time, it's gross too.
__label__1	Brought vehicle in for a glow plug and a thermostat, after they worked on it somehow needed two batteries and a starter. These folks are about as bad as I have ever seen. Will not in any circumstance recommend or return to this place of business, if I ever get out of here.
__label__1	"No visitor parking 

Got my car towed

No one in management listens hard to invite someone over because people don't have space to park and when regular parking is available , car gets towed"
__label__1	"Awful. The majority of the employees here clearly either hate their job or just hate life in general. When I went to check out the manager was basically yelling at people to switch lines. The cash register person was so unfriendly and not helpful. I thought my groceries were going to fall off of the conveyor belt. She begrudgingly bagged my groceries (isn't that her job??) and seemed like she wanted nothing to do with being a cash register clerk. I will
Avoid this store. It's awful compared to my favorites; whole foods and wegmans"
__label__1	This is the worst experience I've ever had with an airline. Not only was my flight (3042) to LA from Philly delayed several hours, but the lay over to Chicago was canceled. They told my that they would not refund my points, and if I wanted to get to LA by the next day, I would have to stay over in Chicago at my own expense. The people in the Philadelphia terminal were incredibly rude, and I will never fly with them again.
__label__1	"The food was ok!  When we arrive late on Friday nite which is 9pm, the waiter seems to be rushing us out even though they close at 10pm!  When they mean 10pm closing, it REALLY means the Staff leaves that time TOO!!!  They had their coat on and ready to leave!!! We were in the middle of eating the waitress keep asking if we wanted boxes to pack our food! 
On top of that the food was the worst  Thai food we had! Food was over cooked and salty!

Horrible experience"
__label__1	If I could give them a 0 I would. One of their carrier's lost my package with products worth $50 I got an email saying it was delivered but I never got anything. I've filed a claim online and all I got was a survey. I've tried calling a million times in the past week and the phone just rings for literally 20 minutes and no one every picks up. I'm about to just go in and give these people a piece of my mind.
__label__1	"Food is fine. Very very bad service. I would not go to this place again. No options for kids. Place looks unkept and a tad unclean. 

They make u sit on dirty tables wait for 30 mins for them to clean up and 15 mins more to take the order. And they added a 15% tip automatically which I hated to pay as our experience was so bad"
__label__1	Cucumbers in my house salad were slimy. Our waiter never came to check on us so we notified the food runner. She did not seemed alarm that we were served food that had literally gone bad and offered me another salad. No thanks! When our server finally came around, we also notified him of the slimy cucumbers. He was also not alarmed. Neither of the servers we reported to felt compelled to report the bad food we were served to a manager. Bad food and bad service, needless to say we won't be going back.
__label__1	This place is an absolute disgrace! Prime location in busy farmers market guarantees non-stop business. The owner of this place clearly knows money won't stop coming in regardless of the fact they keep churning out overpriced terrible food. It takes a uniquely selfish and evil type of person to continually rip tourists off who are just trying to enjoy some authentic Cajun food. Good grief
__label__1	Will absolutely never order from this company again. I ordered a black lives matter t-shirt, said it was delivered but never arrived, they basically blamed me and didn't send another t-shirt or a refund. One of the most disgusting companies I have ever interacted with, absolutely no one should waste their money here.
__label__1	"If you want good sushi, look else where.  The concept is cool, but the execution is definitely under par.  

Nothing seemed fresh.  Nothing tastes fresh.  And I swear I saw something crawling on the wall when I was getting the soy sauce.

It's not a clean place either.  Come at your own risk."
__label__1	Yesterday i called about missing food items and was told rudely by the manager I should make sure i check my bags before i leave their establishment. Not one apology was offered. With this pandemic we are dealing with yiu would think great customer service would be there top priority. I will never spent my dollars with them ever again. And lets not forget i spent $100 this food order and that bad attitude got my $100 back in my pocket so thanks for the ignorance.
__label__1	Sold me a 350 mah battery with 510 threading for $10 more than the average price and the thing doesn't even keep a charge for longer than one min. I charged it until the red light would turn to white until the charger it came with completely fell apart and broke in my pocket. Cheap Chinese bullshit.
__label__1	This place has deteriorated. There is no respect for appointments, some of the techs are horrible and rush the service and my fingers and toes didn't last 1 week. Save your money. Many of the techs don't know the technique for dip powder and they charge you more for the specialty pedicure but the service is the same as the regular.
__label__1	"I whish i would of checked here first, I would of never bought from them ready all the reviews and im experiencing the same dissatisfaction.
Don't waste your time"
__label__1	"This office seems to care very little about animals or their owners. I let them know that one of my cats passed away and would know longer need services (obviously). They showed no remorse, no ""sorry for your loss"" - literally nothing. Several weeks go by and I get a reminder email to schedule an appointment for my cat that passed away. I realize it was probably an automated reminder but you think they'd update their records after I let them know the news of my cat's passing. 

After these experiences, I decided to find another vet."
__label__1	The wings were gross and they had no sauce the pizza taste like day old cardboard a complete waste of $30
__label__1	I went in store to have a diamond verified and guy says it's a Moissanite. My jaw dropped and day was ruined. Next day I took it to three separate diamond stores on jewellers row. All three confirmed premium natural diamond. So if diamonds what u looking for, stay away.
__label__1	Trust me.... take a taxi instead! Seriously...split a taxi with a friend. It will most likely be cheaper... it is not worth waiting on this line for a shuttle that takes super long anyway. Our shuttle driver was super cool and nice when we finally got on board... but they are very terribly organized and rude. I do not recommend them.
__label__1	"I purchase a Greek Yogurt and fruits energy bowl. The fruits were very bad. The blueberries were very tiny and dry with the steams still on it, the strawberries were old and soggy and the bananas were brown. I would expect fresh fruit  since is a place to grab a ""healthy"" snack. Very disappointed."
__label__1	Extremely under staffed (on a Sunday!) and we waited 45mins for our food. Ridiculous. They are poorly stocked on items because their vendors are not delivering. (Eg no napkins on tables). Sandwich was mediocre but the salad was extremely poor...tons of spinach but just a little bit of carrots and feta to cover the spinach. Needless to say we will not be coming back.
__label__1	I am writing to warn people about renting from budget. I purchased my van rental through southwest for approx $650. I called the previous 3 days from my arrival to be assurred that the van would be available. Upon my arrival no van....then found my bill to be $1096!!! As if the was not bad enough, they charged my credit card $1250. Warning and do your research prior to renting was told that Reno charges a 43% tax. Will not be renting from budget again.
__label__1	"Not up front about diagnostic pricing.  It will cost you $100 to put your foot in the door. I have $100 less than I did and 20 minutes later found out nothing about why my radio isn't working. It would be a good business practice to say,  ""We can run a diagnostic.  It will cost $100.  We may or may not find out what is wrong."""
__label__1	June 3, 2021 and It's no longer in business. I guess Covid killed it. Tables and chairs but no humans available.
__label__1	"Called four times this week to get some questions answered about the prenatal massage for my wife and to schedule a couple sessions. Spoke with multiple receptionists who would ""pass it along"" because apparently they don't work out of the office of the massueses. Not one returned call was made. Ridiculous service.  Moving on to next place."
__label__1	George is, as always, clueless, even more than his son!!! Remove all the cameras and scrub the horrible, piss smelling bathrooms. Avoid at all costs!
__label__1	Worst customer service ever. The Manager has poor business skills and does not know how to run a business.  I have been to this Restaurant before but had the worst restaurant experience on this visit and will never be back. I had an employee tell a Certificate would be honored when we first got there before we even ordered, then when the checks came the manager rescinded on what the waiter had told us. No consideration or respect for the customer. She was extremely rude. I feel the owner should be notified on how she is handling their business and treating their customers.
__label__1	Real tablecloths don't make up for poor quality food. I visited for lunch and was served a sad salad (just iceberg lettuce) and a very overcooked (black and tough) sausage layed on a roll and served with greasy, slimy onions and peppers. The music was loud and obnoxious Rat Pack over and over. Nope, I wouldn't go again.
__label__1	Very disappointed with my experience with this place. Very unprofessional attitude and Sensei Mikes needs to educate himself first about doing business in the community. They tried to enforce a 9 month contract of lessons on a child. When told our child was uncomfortable with the Sensei Mike and would not continue after 2 lessons they would not let us leave and contacted a collection agency. STAY AWAY!!!
__label__1	I've ordered from them via Uber Eats a few times. Twice they've forgotten to add the drinks. Not ordering from them again as it's too much of a hassle to chase down my money. They don't exactly make it easy.
__label__1	AWFUL. AVOID THIS PLACE!!! Customer service is the worst and the owner doesn't care and seems miserable, which speaks a lot about the place. They also try to overcharge you as well so check your bill if you decide to take the risk and eat here.  Plenty of other restaurants in the area choose from! Hell even dominos would be better than dealing with this place!
__label__1	This garden is not actually accepting memberships from other gardens for admission even though they claim to be participating ​in the AHS reciprocal program.
__label__1	"I don't often get frustrated but this is possibly the worst dining experience I've had in years. 25 minutes and no food and no refills on water. It's 95 degrees in the dining room. There's 6 tables uncleared and cleaned. All we ordered were egg dishes and French toast with bacon. 
Please don't waste your time. I'm doing it for you."
__label__1	This place is a joke. The women working at the hostess stand were talking crap about a customer and rolling their eyes. We have two small children and asked that their food come out first. Of course our food came out before the kids. Then they decided to bring our appetizer last. But wait... it was the wrOng appetizer. We had to track Down someone  for box to take my kids cold pizza home. And by the way I'm still waiting on my drink to be refilled. 40 min wait for this?? Never again
__label__1	They held my car hostage after being sent there through CarMax warranty.  They are trying to turn an hour job into 4.  My car has been there a week and they are still haggling with Carmax over a couple of hundred bucks.  I know Carmax isnt much better, but I should have listened to other about MB of Nashville.
__label__1	Would give 0 stars if possible. Worst takeout experience. Food was wrong, contacted restaurant and when I asked for a refund it took the manager 25 mins to get it. Beware this location do not order anything online and the manager does not care if it is wrong or not.
__label__1	This is about Walmart policy... 3:45pm Sunday we walk in. 4:05pm we try to walk out the same door we came in... closed!  We parked on the far side... took forever walking to the car. I don't mind the walk but why in the world would they lock a door in the middle of the afternoon?  COVID?  No way!
__label__1	Verbally abused by employee,  would not honor legitimate coupon.. I'm a disabled senior citizen and afraid to go back. Wonder if the employer did backround checks on employee!!
__label__1	"Under new management.   I used to LOVE this place.  The new recipes are not as good.  The food is bland and the gravy and sauces are way too thick and heavy.   They serve the combo plate with pork fried rice, beware if you do not eat pork.   They do not tell you this in advance. 
The parking lot was completely empty at 12 noon on a Friday if that is any indication their popularity has declined.  It used to be packed under the old management."
__label__1	I wish there was a way to do less than one star. I mean honestly. I am very disappointed in the service quality and speed. We came with a large group of people and MADE RESERVATIONS almost two and a half hours in advance and waited outside for a literal hour. Unbelievable. The kept informing us the table was ready and every time we came in it was not. We had a diabetic with us as well as several babies. Very disappointed.
__label__1	I had the  Boston strangler.  VERY little steak, never found any grilled onions, lettuce that looked like it had been ground up, but so much blue cheese that I  couldn't taste anything else. My husband had the Hannibal and also had a hard time finding any meat. We won't be back.
__label__1	Unprofessional and Would not recommend. I booked appointment in advance and was told, just bring it in. I went to location told to check in and was told, computers were down (lie) I had confirmation from their end confirming appointment. Would not recommend location until improvements are met, would not return unless provided DECENT service not even asking for a crazy amount of work. Simple Oil Change, Major Headache.
__label__1	Service is rude, seafood doesn't taste fresh. Can't understand why the review is so good?! Never again!
__label__1	Placed a DoorDash order at 12:30... waited until 2:00 when they eventually cancelled my order. After it said a dasher was on the way. My order was only a salad. Ridiculous.
__label__1	I went through the exact same experience with good ol' Harry as Shrewd C. Price gouging is the least of this thieving establishment's atrocities. They thrive on taking advantage of customers who don't know any better. Avoid this chain like the plague, and do your due diligence to find an honest mechanic.
__label__1	"Had two tires mounted here. I paid well over twice what I would've paid at any other shop, but I paid it to save a trip out of town. No one there was kind or friendly.. the owners, the ""techs"".. no one. The ""tech"" put my sticky weights up front where everyone can see them instead of hidden further back. When he finished he threw my rims onto the gravel and destroyed the fresh paint and clear coat on them. I'll never go back and I urge anyone that cares about their money or rims to just drive to a better shop."
__label__1	Yikes!  Seriously the worst place I've eaten in awhile.   Asked for snapper fillet and they brought out the entire fish, 3 times, and after the 3rd try, ultimately served shredded fish.  Tons of bones and cartilage still in the shreds. Once we were seated, The wait for food was also unbearably long, at least an hour.   Of all the great restaurants available, there's no need to visit this one.   I would give it no stars, but had to choose 1 for purposes of this review.
__label__1	I have never had a worse experience at a fast food place before. If I could find a way to complain louder, I would.
__label__1	I've been waiting here for about 30 mins. I've seen the same 2 ladies that work here sit outside the entire time and either do nothing or play on there phone. I haven't even opened my account yet but I'm already dreading having to deal with this place.
__label__1	Terrible Chinese food overpriced and restaurant is filthy seen roaches running around beware stay away!
__label__1	Omg' it's only been a week since the last disaster on Spirit! Yep, get everyone on the plane this time and tell us a knob fell off and the Captain's chair has a problem! Did all this happen just since they landed less then a hour ago? This airline is the worst in customer service, flight delivery and just BS! Yes, everything is ala cart, but do we have to go through this EVERY week? Don't serve up another thing TO ME, I have all that I can handle with this airline!
__label__1	Literally the worst Dunkin to go to. I would give it 0 stars if I could. We come here only because it's the closest one to our house. The service is ALWAYS horrible, they consistently rush when we're ordering, they take forever, and they 9 times out of 10, mess up our order. This place really needs new management or something. If you decide to go here, good luck.
__label__1	"The worst place ever!!! Made up prices!!! Management is horrible ""Eileen""...Bitch has an attitude problem. Who wants to pay for a service before its rendered!!!"
__label__1	We have been a few times, chicken fried steak was delicious but the service sucks.  It's really sad because the previous owners were really friendly. They do not have enough help so it makes the service bad.  We have a dog so we are always looking for a patio, their patio open sometimes, most of the time not.  My daughter called to see if patio was open they answered phone with a quick yes and didn't even say good bye, just a click. So now we go to Hugo's for our CF Steak.. Great food Great Service.
__label__1	Hair did not turned out as I asked, highlights looks brassy, need to make another appointment at an uptown hair salon for color correction which i've Should gone to in the first place but needed to get my hair done at the last minute. Ben was nice but not a good colorist/hair stylist. Never again, what a waste of $$$.
__label__1	Messed up our order and didnt give us cheese with the nachos....drive back a 2nd time an they give us a half cup of cheese for a big order of nachos? They didnt really seem to care about the inconvenience at all. Wont be back thats for sure.
__label__1	"I had the worst experience tonight. The menu had an ""old"" price and when the check came it was higher than the menu price. I asked to speak with the manager she told me that she would NOT honor the menu price. It was an oversight. Any good manager would has honored the price and then made sure that all of the menu prices were changed after that. If she had done that then they would have a repeat customer forever. But because of her POOR managerial skills. I'm done with the Reef."
__label__1	Tried to charge me over $1,000 for parts and labor when my vehicle was still covered under warranty, Matt's whole persona changed when I addressed this with documentation. Then falsely passed my vehicle for inspection with a bad turn signal, and did not want to take responsibility for any of these issues. Avoid and go somewhere else for vehicle service.
__label__1	I've visited this restaurant with lot of expectations. Since a lot of people wrote reviews. I did order Grouper platter as suggested by the restaurant person. The food was not all good. Something they prepAred for name sake. I wont suggest it to anyone.
__label__1	was eating here and a rat crawled across my foot.... if that wasn't bad enough the Milanese was dry and service was subpar.
__label__1	This place is straight garbage. COVID or not. They have never once gotten the order right. Frequently leave something off of the order. Over priced mediocre.
__label__1	My megajuana chimi had hardly any steak in it and was smaller than my girlfriends regular chimi. They also laid it in a bed of wet soggy old lettuce that I did not order and it made my chimi and chips completely soggy and gross. Everything was cold even the queso. First and last time at this location.
__label__1	Stay as far away from this place as possible.   I have had my car 2 months and I have made $6000.00 in repairs. Called talked to my salesman Matt he could have cared less.  He said they might have saved me money if I would have used their mechanic. In my opinion this place should be shut down.
__label__1	If only your site allowed one to give a negative star.  Stay away from this property and especially the general manager Jerry Sieve.  He proves the model that customer service starts at the top.  He provides none and instead is loud, argumentative and insulting.  It was impossible to even conduct a civil discussion with him.  His lack of civility and responsiveness trickles down to certain staff members from whom I could not get a return phone call regarding an item left in my room that was subsequently discarded by housekeeping.  You would think that a hotel would be in the people business.  Not so.  Stay away.
__label__1	Fraud.. Do not buy anything from them.. You will never receive your furniture... Good luck, you have been warned.
__label__1	Very rude and disrespectful owner. This isn't a business,  this place is a joke. I feel sorry for his employees and customers. I'm not surprised about so many bad reviews about the owner and this place. I felt very mistreated and disrespected and never ever will go back, good news I'm taking my money elsewhere. Something needs to be done about businesses like this, where customer service really sucks. Please spread the word around.
__label__1	SLOW!!!! Then they got my order wrong.  The place is convenient and clean, but the slow service and mistakes doesn't make a good balance for average BBQ
__label__1	Since Covid, this restaurant has become less then desirable. Service is not up to par and sushi combinations are terrible choices. We purchased the he most expensive combo that should have fed 4-6 people and it was so not the case! This will be the last time i bring my family to this place.
__label__1	"if you want a reputable company who will cover your home,
protect you and stands by their clients, do not hire avatar. 
they are the worse possible insurance company you can
find. they are totally untrustworthy. they scam you!!!!!!

do not hire avatar to insure your home. they will give you
a hard time and will lie to their clients. when you have a
problem, they won't honor their contracts!!!!"
__label__1	I relate to what other reviewers have written. My experience renting a house from them has been a terrible experience. I view business as business, but even with this perspective, there was no empathy, no customer service, no concern for tenants. It seems like they look out for themselves first and for the homeowner second with no regard for the tenant or their situation. My contact there was often rude and unhelpful. I rented a high priced home that was lovely, but I would not do it again because the situation was untenable.
__label__1	2015 they allow smoking.  Brings in an unsavory element.  Also, you can't taste good beer when there is a smoke stench.  I will drink where I can breath.
__label__1	This place is closed and I say good riddance.  The fountain machine hardly worked and the last two times I was there, the potato chips were served raw.  A year ago this place was pretty good but these faults are inexcusable when the place is never that busy when I was there.
__label__1	Found hair in my ramen, broth was full of msg, noodles were chewy, and was overall just bad. I had high hopes but this proves yet again that yelp reviewers have low standards and are easily impressed. All the yelp elite 2019 give out 5 stars like stickers. Overrated
__label__1	Went in to check this place out since I work down the street.  I believe there's two owners & the women owner seemed to go up to everyone but us to see if they had any questions. When I picked what I wanted they poured and charged us way more than what we waited.  Thing was he had to open a second bag to pour more out and one bag was the right amount.   It had seemed like a lot but I have never bought loose leaf tea before.  It wasn't until I looked at the receipt I noticed.
__label__1	HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! Called in a delivery order for lunch, they not only forgot my food but said they'd re-deliver it. After another 45 min and no food, I called back and they said they'd only re-deliver if I paid a service fee for driver because of THEIR error. No thank you!!!!
__label__1	I have been using this post office for 20 years and the service has continued to get worse.  With long lines and poor service.  You can drive to Vassar faster then the service you will receive at McCabe.  Our community mail box was vandalized over 2 weeks ago and they still have not issued new keys.  We cannot get any answers.
__label__1	3 times I have been here and all 3 times food has been undercooked and I got very sick. Tried all different things and all 3 times I got sick. Water refilling is a joke, 4 young ladies walked by with water and did not even bother to look. Had to order another water once she brought the check because no one was paying attention, even the bartenders were just hitting on the front desk clerks. Cooks were funny. Food was good going down for the most part, the Apps were good and my bowl was also good except for getting sick.
__label__1	The wings fell off. Hard. I got ten wings and the drums were bitesize- only with a bone in them. So small and such a disappointment. Their wings used to be delicious and filling. We are currently on the hunt for a different wing place. Maybe we'll try again in 6 months and hope this was just a bad batch. I'm just not sure why the chef thought it was acceptable.
__label__1	There is nothing Taza about this place !! No freshness whatsoever, I'd rather eat sweaty old socks then another bite of their old rice cooked weeks ago!! Nasty meat and smelly veggies old rotten! I am never going back and shame on you for calling yourself fresh kings !!
__label__1	This location claims to be open until 11 PM, with no signs or indications otherwise. We arrived at 9 PM and were turned away for no valid reason. Trash. Disappointing.
__label__1	con  artist I had a leaky roof at the back  room I called roof guru they gave me a estimate of 1400 to repair the leak I gave them half down they came two week later to do the job guest what it still leak they played games like its something else so why they didn't tell me that in the first place then tried to get me to do new siding haven't herd from them since stay away
__label__1	This business should update their hours on their website and Yelp. The place was closed at 4pm when I got there today on a Thursday.  I will just go to REI from now on. I'm tired of this place being unpredictable with their hours.
__label__1	"Pathetic. 
I wouldn't even give it a star. I can't believe I just paid hard earned money to eat here. 
Customer Service was horrible. Waitress was rude. Food was cold, and we were one of two tables being served. 
Staff was sitting, eating, and on cell phones. More than a disappointing restaurant experience."
__label__1	Bad service poorly cooked food.  Beer was good but I had to get it from the bar.  Waitress had a friend at the bar so she spent most of her time talking to her.  They messed up the temp on my burger.  They brought out the wrong thing to my daughter and we had to wait for them to cook what she asked for.  No apologies for that.  Never coming back here that's for sure.
__label__1	The fist person I spoke with was the most rude experience I have had in my adult life.  Just poor customer service right out of the gate.  Taking my business elsewhere unfortunately.
__label__1	I tried to order food, but they wouldn't take my order. Saw the two workers in there and as I pulled off the worker raised both middle fingers at me, yes they where closed, but I did not know this at the time. Was this necessary? Could you have just told me you were closed instead of flipping me off?
__label__1	This place is exceptionally bad. Naans are chewy (probably frozen and reheated), food is stale and tastes horrible. Recently they even failed the restaurant inspection for bad hygienec practices and I am seriously not surprised. Owners are rude when you complain to them about the bad quality of the food. We literally had to throw the food in the trash after tasting it.
__label__1	Drove 30 minutes to eat here and they were closed. No sign on the door and no one answering the phone. Update your hours or at least leave a note explaining why you closed early. A little common courtesy goes a long way...
__label__1	Says there open til 3:00am turned away at 12:45. This place is a joke. Think it's funny that you won't let paying customers in when you highlight being open as your main selling point.
__label__1	This has got to be the worst insurance co in the USA. I was rear ended two weeks ago.  Progressive had pretty much settled before The General even contacted me and I was insure by The General. General crap for service.
__label__1	Have only been once. IMHO they have over priced food which is just marginal quality. I won't be going back. I'm a meat and potatoes man and when I asked for a potato not only could they not deliver on my request, they acted as though I was committing a sin to even ask
__label__1	got the lasagna it was just a bowl of grease and honestly nasty, exchanged it for the italian sausage penne which doesn't match its description, no marinara sauce present, and tasted of nothing, didn't wanna go through the trouble of reordering
__label__1	"Have been to this TJs twice. The first time the wings were messed up and not what I ordered, although what I got was pretty good. The second , and maybe last, time I sat in the bar area for 15 minutes with no one waiting on me. Multiple servers walked right by and no one stopped. Finally I walked out. 

Need to shore up that service!!!!!"
__label__1	If you had a good experience at this place, you should play the lottery. How you take a place with so much promise upon opening and mismanage it into oblivion, I just don't know.
__label__1	Food is awesome! Service SUCKS! Get ready to wait, because if you don't look like their kind forget it. We couldn't even see, it was so dark in the place. The candle was out they didn't even try to replace it, we had to use phone flashlight to see menu. We waited 30 minutes for a ticket.
__label__1	"Super expensive 2nd hand items. I don't think the owner is aware that you can actually purchase clothes for under $20 now days and we're talking about brand new garments. 

Highly overpriced for a generic items."
__label__1	Just finished what looked like a sample of the swamp. Not entirely sure what all the unappetizing looking mystery meat was but I suggest purchasing packaged items from nearby souvenir shops in the airport. I'm not one to judge a book by its cover, but aside from the looks of my food - the woman serving it was sneezing near the open buffet to plate my food, hardly covering her mouth. Sure hope my stomach survives this flight!
__label__1	Classic bait and switch. I ordered AVERY labels and received el cheapo, off brand MACO labels. Also way overcharged for shipping.  Avoid this company. Terrible.
__label__1	Awful. Sat ourselves in the bar area not far from the bar. No one acknowledged us. After 10 minutes of looking around wondering if we would ever be greeted or if we would be waited on we left. Was willing to give the new management a chance but I'll spend my money elsewhere.
__label__1	"These effin morons can't install breaks. We took our car back to the dealership, rather than here.......the dealership showed us that they put them in totally wrong. Pictures to prove it. 

If you want to waste money and die, definitely bring your vehicle here!"
__label__1	People love smoking weed here don't come if you have kids disgusting piece of paradise other then kids skipping school smoking weed
__label__1	I went with my Uncle several times. I have my concealed weapons permit and everything. I'm not new at shooting. I am new to certain guns that I've never shot before so he'll show me how they work. Today we were told that we aren't allowed to come back because my Uncle was acting as an instructor and they said we were taking business from them. So now they won't get any business from us. Ridiculous. Spent lots of money there. Won't be returning.
__label__1	Not the best place only four people can use one hookah or you can say four people per table  that's very annoying
__label__1	Return your keys!!!! I made the mistake of not returning my electonic key and they charged me an extra months rent  and late fee even after the lease had ended and we were moved out. No where in the lease does it say they will do that. What makes matters even worse is the key is electronic! (They can just cancel the key so no one could use it again.) It's plastic and maybe costs 50 cents. I am still paying damage fees 6th months after I moved out for ridiculous reasons. Do not live here! It definitely wasn't worth it.
__label__1	How is it after 15 months of owning my 2020 Tacoma, purchased new in March 2020 from Stadium, and taking it to another Toyota dealer out of state for an Etune situation, I learn there is a subscription plan I was able to get to have remote starting and other features.  Pretty much I paid, was given the keys and sent on my way when I bought this vehicle.  I wanted a rear pad for the truck and am still waiting.  Do yourself a favor and buy from a dealer other than Stadium Toyota.  You'll be glad you did.
__label__1	Terrible service..... tried calling at 1:40 and they didn't want answer answer the phone which tempted me to come in.. Got there at 1:50 just for them to still have to take my order. When they could of just taken my phone order instead of trying to say their closed.Me being a frequent customer and knowing that they close at 2..... used to be one of my favorite place now it's not....
__label__1	Have been to this establishment a few times, each time service was super slow and requests were not followed. Sometimes servers just have a bad day so we've tried the place a few times to give them a chance. But after our last experience of waiting 45 minutes for our food and then getting the wrong food and waiting another 15+ minutes we've concluded that this'll probably be our last time
__label__1	Staff was great but Dr. Baker was very unprofessional.  He acted like he did not care at all about what I had to say.  Seemed as if he had something better to do.  I went here because of some of the other reviews but my experience was completely different when dealing with Dr. Baker.  I would not recommend him because of his unprofessional manner.
__label__1	This is the worst, most disgusting habit I've been to. What kind of food establishment puts their benches right next to garbage cans? This places was infested with flies, like couldn't even eat my food cause flies were all over you kind of infested. Don't go to this habit
__label__1	"The worst service. Don't waste your time or money. Takes days to reach their ""customer service."" When you do, they put you on hold and don't get back on the phone!. Both my wife, another individual working for us, and I had the exact experience. Evidently so have others."
__label__1	"This UPS is one of the worst if not the worst UPS store in Philly. The staffs are slow and rude. The customer service is even worst than USPS.

Shame on UPS, I wish UPS could realize the problems and replace the people here."
__label__1	"BUYER BEWARE

Bad service here. Seriously.  
Stay away from 
Ehab sales
George sales
Michelle -Management. 

Bought furniture here against our better judgement, because sales guys were nice but light on knowledge.  Of course they were, they hadn't gotten our money yet. 
Long story short, delivered the wrong items, wrong table, wrong bench, wrong recliner, we moved them to California and just to see the furniture wrong.  Contacted Kanes and basically said ""well since we didn't ship it, you are out of luck""

Stay away. Seriously. Be warned. If you get screwed it's on you!"
__label__1	"The food looks amazing, unfortunately no one would seat me or acknowledge me- so I left. I stood at the ""please wait to be seated"" sign for a good 5 min in a practically empty empty restaurant. A waitress walked past me and ignored me. I actually called the restaurant while standing there and still didn't get service? I'd maybe try them again for take out, but only because it's the only Greek place near my apt. And only for takeout."
__label__1	Horrible food. I ordered a hot sausage po boy and I got a raw hamburger patty on a hoagie bun. Plus for two take out entrees it was $31.
__label__1	At 6am being tbe only one here to get my car it takes 15 min to receive my car.. These men are all foreign anExtremely rude and unprofessional. These attendants are never in the office to take your car or get your car and act angry if you seek them out by walking the lot. My company bought a month here and the firat day i arrived they tried to tell me my small SUV was too tall. It's about 8 inches below the max height posted online.  I haven't noticed theft yet just extreme unprofessional
__label__1	Check time or talk to your employees regarding closing. Just walked in at 10:25 and employees were cleaning and said that it was closed. When in Yelp shows closing at 11pm! Ridiculous!
__label__1	The food here is an embarrassment, especially given the high price. With the history this place has, they should at least serve palatable food -- which they do not.
__label__1	"I sent them 200 pictures and 9 VHS-C tapes.  Five months later I received a bunch of overly color corrected jpegs and not a single minute of my footage.  Instead, I received footage of someone else's fishing trip.  I've called.  I get bounced around.

They certainly didn't have a hard time taking my money.

This place is fraudulent.  100% full of shit.  

I cannot tell you enough how much of a scam this is.  

Infuriating."
__label__1	"Food was ok - but took about 45 minutes to cash out.  When server brought my ticket, he had charged me over 3x what I owed.  Took another 15 minutes to get that cleared up and he didn't seem too concerned about it.  Didn't seem like a big deal to them - ""Sorry - we got a new system a couple of weeks ago"". There was a definite breakdown in the system.  Will not be back."
__label__1	"Greedy managers/owners charge for tap water which should be available for free to encourage responsible drinking. Not to mention there's already a price of entry given it's a ticketed music venue.

Do yourself a favor and go to the better music venues in the city, like Union Transfer etc."
__label__1	Worst customer service - the store is not properly staffed- waited 45 minutes at the deli then another 20 minutes to check out
__label__1	I came here to return an unopened product and was told that I couldn't return the product today because the manager had left. When I asked what the managers hours are the girl told me she would be in at 9. Well I work so I wanted to know how long the manager would be in and her response was that she doesn't know. The manager comes and goes throughout the day. WTF?! How can a business have a structure like that and not allow regular employees to return items? I will not be purchasing items anymore.
__label__1	Absolutely awful. I ordered delivery, and when I got my chicken it was completely raw and pink inside. The sauce was gross and the vegetables and rice were over cooked. To top it all off, no one answered the phone when I tried to call about it. STAY AWAY!!!
__label__1	Gnats everywhere! Bland salsa ....food not great...don't waste ur time...there are much better Mexican restaurants around!!!!
__label__1	If u have an appointment at 9 don't expect to be called until almost 10 then what's the point of an appointment might as well not have ! Beyond pissed I have waited an hour for my appointment this is a joke this place!
__label__1	"Jersey mikes is my favorite sandwich chain. This store gave me my first bad sandwich. 

Did the crew in the back soak the sandwich in mayonnaise?! Lay off the mayo. I like your subs because the ingredients taste good, not your mayo. Like holy moly you could have used 1/4 of the mayonnaise and it would have been fine. 

Disgusting."
__label__1	The only good thing about this restaurant was the aquarium. The food was less than mediocre and way over priced. The service was slow and they had waiters everywhere so I have no idea what they were doing. Basically it's a Captain D's with a giant fish tank in it. We will not be coming back.
__label__1	Been going there since it first opened in 1991. Back in Tampa on this side id town and decided to stop in..ordered veggie appetizers and somosa chaat.  It was NOT good at all... The pictures speaks for themselves.
__label__1	Horrible food even worse service. Seriously mean staff and food is very bland. Try to be nicer to your customers but they just don't get it
__label__1	"1. Timing - I had my car here for wheel cap / tire replacement & bumper repair...took them a week. 
2. Quality - Any time you get your car back from an auto body shop & they tell you to take it somewhere to fix something they did wrong. Instant red flag.
3. Customer Service - Owner/Manager of the location took zero responsibility for returning my car with a new problem. They then sent me else where to get what they did wrong fixed, covering zero of the incremental cost."
__label__1	Delivery was wrong and online menu not accurate. Tricked into ordering sides they charge you for. When I called to complain, Theresa the manager gave me a 5 dollar credit for a screwed up 23 dollar order for 2 friggin sandwiches. Done with this place.
__label__1	"Terrible beyond reason. Old seafood, bland, some items were overcooked while others were undercooked. 

My previous, detailed, one-star review was removed."
__label__1	Five friends and I went here for my birthday on Saturday OCT 3rd. We patiently waited at the door until the doorman (bald guy) was extremely rude to us because someone in our party was drinking a water. I see how this could be mistaken as a alcoholic drink but I would have appreciated if this guy would have clarified this before he rudely accused us of something. He was very humiliating and demeaning.  I WILL not support an establishment that allows this. It seems as if few others have had the same problem. Needless to say, I will not be back.
__label__1	Why does it not surprise me that even a corporate store is able to through their hands up and say sorry I can't help you when it comes to billing issues. I am advised to call the customer number that you can never get through to and then are forced to do it in a chat.  All store are able to take your money but are never able to assist and I think that is a joke.
__label__1	F them. Bait and switch Ihad been illegal for years but this company gets a Pass. 4 minutes? Great! Then I commit it's 14 Minutes...criminal, literally.  Try to contact them? Good luck. Black hole of bs menus.  They killed independent cans now we are f'd
__label__1	"I bought a jacket and sweater to westward. Both were not cleaned well. The jacket has designer buttons that were replaced with buttons that did not fit, and they later admitted that they ""melted "" the buttons. They were very rude and the jacket is ruined. Maybe ok for shirts but nothing of higher quality"
__label__1	They forgot an item in my delivery and didn't provide a spoon for the rice pudding - do they expect me to eat rice pudding with my hands?  Careless work.
__label__1	"After years of eating here on an almost weekly basis, we won't be coming back. 
After waiting nearly an hour, after being told the wait was 20 minutes, the party of twelve that was AFTER us on the wait list (and had arrived much after our family) was seated before us. When I complained to the hostess and then the manager, I was told that it was easier to seat the large party together so we would have to wait. 
Horrible customer service."
__label__1	HORRIBLE management. Our Mail room was broken into- management ignored alerting the tenants. Rushed to put up cameras and were hush hush. Didn't notify us next steps on filing police reports and were rude upon reaching out to them.
__label__1	"These jackasses also go by ""At Your Service"" an authorized repair shop for Kitchenaid. I can't agree more with the people who said wish I could give them zero stars. Zero competence, zero customer service, zero knowledge of the products. I have never had a bigger problem with a repair company. Run away run far away and fast."
__label__1	The food wasn't good. Not to mention I called in my order and still had to wait 45mins once I arrived.... Never again and it's so unfortunate because  it's so close to me so it would have been so convenient
__label__1	HORRIBLE!! This guy is a nasty scam artist. He lures you in with good prices but then up sells on everything. He is rude and insulting. Most importantly, his products are  bogus. I spent quite a bit of money and had zero effect. I full believe I was injected with saline or something equivalent. He's a garbage human being. Stay far away!!
__label__1	"I was not impressed with this location. I have been to others and this one just posed me off to be honest. The two bartenders were so over flirtation with my boyfriend it made him and I uncomfortable and I am pretty sure one of them put something it his drink because he doesn't remember anything after we left ""He quote not mine"" and he only had two beers. I will not be going back thats just super creepy even for me"
__label__1	"Horrible, mean and unfriendly manager.  She is the older lady that is always standing up front.  Wouldn't go back no matter how good the food is because of her.  Unbelievable that ""they"" would have someone so ""BAD"" working in a service job.  She needs to go and then things will probably improve 100%.  Every time I am in that area, I notice the place is always empty.  Oh well!!! Wonder why???"
__label__1	We'd been before with friends and it was OK, went back because we liked the shishito peppers.  Waited over an hour for any food at all.  After we were seated, begged for service just for drinks after 20 mins, then left after our food didn't come.
__label__1	Spare yourself the agony and shake down a gas station for a old slice. You'd be doing yourself a big favor. Floor was filthy pizza was way worse
__label__1	Run down hotel. It looks good on the website but not in person. People here are unprofessional, rude, disrespectful and bad management. This shit hole will not last. Everything about this hotel is wrong and the people that works here dont give a damn about their jobs. THUMBS DOWN FOR ME!!!
__label__1	Flies in the pastry cabinet. Warm and smelly cream left out with no thermos or way to keep it cold. No fresh decaf... instead they gave it to me old and bitter and heated up in the microwave. Snooty millennial servers who seem annoyed when I pointed out the cream issue. Wifi down. The location is great for drive-through, so I wish this place was better.
__label__1	My dog was low on medication. When I called to check on delivery I was told they did not have the medication and would not have it in stock. This was a chemotherapy medication that could not be stopped abruptly. No one there seemed too concerned. I spoke to a supervisor who was indifferent. I would stay far away from this company. Uncaring and indifferent. No thank you. I love my dog, even though they don't seem to care.
__label__1	This place wasn't great some years ago but now it is just horrible.  Wifi didn't work, they did not know p/w. No towels in rest room. Hot sauce jar was filthy. Food sucks, when you feel sickly while eating, you know it sucks. coffee sucks.  No one there @ 8:30AM.  Friendly service but could not overcome all else. Would never recommend coming here.
__label__1	"An unresponsive office. 
Message after message left.
Waits in excess of an hour of your SCHEDULED appointment time. 
Terrible organization and time management.
Get a new office administrator."
__label__1	The slowest surliest service ever. Their website was so slow I had to drive there. Told the cashier then asked what the specials were. Nothing like what I'd seen on the web. Ordered (my mistake). Then was able to find the specials and went back. Guy said I had to order online! And couldn't refund or change my order. Ugh
__label__1	"How can the owners of this Jack-in-the-Box allow it to continue with one star.  


The worst service They can't remember anything they all run around like they don't know what they're doing it's unbelievable

In the 20 minutes I was here I saw no lesson five people's orders go out incorrectly"
__label__1	"I went to this place and had my hair highlighted after showing him a picture of the color that I wanted. When I golt home and looked at the picture of the same photo that I had in my living room, I realized the color did come close. I called and left a message within 24 hours for a redo, and never received a return call. I was also charged more money than quoted.

I would never recoomend this place to anyone."
__label__1	Without a doubt, the WORST mani-pedi I've ever received. I wanted a french pedi and a mani with clear polish only. The french is such a sloppy mess that I have an appt tomorrow at another salon to have it re-done. I repeatedly kept pointing out corrections that needed to be made, but clearly she wasn't capable or willing to fix things. I asked for squared nails and got pointed, the place is not clean, several nail techs were visibly sick (coughing and sniffling)...and the list goes on!
__label__1	"After seven, that's right seven months someone from Blackbear contacted me to try and make the third time doing my driveway the ""charm.""  Really?  You wait seven months to contact me after a bad review?  Poor business practices.  Don't be fooled by the coupon you receive it's not worth it."
__label__1	Seriously, the worst meal I've had in months. If you come here prepare for greasy garbage that will put you on the bowl almost immediately.  The only good thing in this restaurant was the crushed ice.
__label__1	Worst wings ever with a fat price tag...horrible. I would advise you to bring your food from somewhere else if you're staying in the hotel. If you're going for entertainment, eat beforehand. The food was overcooked and the lemonade taste like toilet water. No thanks.
__label__1	the worst ever , im glad lyft and uber in town , them cab always dirty , them driver have nasty attitude ,if you call them to report any issue them gm never want help .
__label__1	The fish and chips was awful.  The fish did not taste right nor did it have the right consistency.  Our server didn't seem to care, so here I am on Yelp. My wife enjoyed her lunch (tomato soup) though so not all bad.
__label__1	"Worst Indian Restaurant in St.louis area.
Ordered biryani with high hopes of good taste it is like Chili Rice never feel biryani taste not even minimum biryani looks like. I am sure this not made by Indian chef. 
Second ordered butter naan full of stones and sand while eating.

I was on the way near to this and just tried, sure this will be my final and never prefer again and anybody waste of money.
Very bad experience total food wasted kids even not able to eat."
__label__1	Appointment at 3 and they didn't take my truck back til 4:45.. it's now 5:30 and still don't have my truck.. all this for a nail in the tire.. wow..
__label__1	Went last night for drinks and food.  For the money it wasn't worth it.  The service was good but the food is not so good.  I'll not go back.  And overall it's $$$$ and not worth it.  Don't bother.
__label__1	We were here on a quick girls vacation. The good points it was clean and the service was ok . However the food was awful we both ordered the crawfish Mac and cheese.  It was velvetta and noodles no flavor I was made from a box.  There are so many other places to go in New Orleans to eat do not try here.
__label__1	Took over ten minutes to get food, staff were rude and unhelpful, and when we got our order the food was almost all wrong...
__label__1	Overcharge for parts. Lied and told me that I could pay with a card in the store, only to tell me that it is cash only. Very sketchy place, avoid.
__label__1	Master movers claims to move your items from beginning to end but they do not.  Another moving company came to deliver my items  20 business days later. I was shocked to find out that it wasn't master movers! They did not tell me this when I booked the move. They can not tell you when your items will be shipped or delivered because they sell your shipment to another company.  Good luck getting your stuff!  I called almost every day for a month to find out when my shipment would be shipped or delivered and could never get an answer until the day before the other moving company showed up.  zero stars.
__label__1	No bananas in the banana pudding they only put banana flavored pudding with whipped cream and some cookies in a take out container I also got a brownie , it was basically fudge with a cookie on top  I was extremely excited to get these desserts and be a regular customer but this is devastating
__label__1	"How can such a criminally incompetent lending company be allowed to operate in the United States? There has been a long string of negative experiences relating to this company, and how it has handled my mortgage. Now this week I'm trying to login to their joke of a website, but the login no longer works. Their website displays no phone number. Their ""chat now"" page provides nothing more than an email address."
__label__1	Sad attempt to copy Hooters. Poor service (beer sat for several minutes before served), took waitress 20 min before returning to take our food order even though place was NOT busy, bland wing sauces/ seasoning (Extra Hot was mild by all accounts). Best thing was cheese fries.
__label__1	"They forged my signature.  

That's not just lazy, it's fraudulent.  

Seriously.  They are horrendous!"
__label__1	"Took my Toyota Sequoia in for a quote for auto body damage over a month ago. Charles took pictures and told me I would get a quote back within a day or two. 

I've called him now TWICE to follow up on the quote he promised. I spoke with him personally when I followed up (did not leave a voicemail). Each time he told me he would send my quote by the end of the day. 

Lots of promises. Still no quote. 

Would not recommend this business."
__label__1	This place sucks!  We came at 3:30 to check in. They said our room was not ready but they would take our number and call us soon.  We came back two hours later and it is still not ready. It is now 6:30 and it is still not ready.
__label__1	Never come here. Spent hundreds of dollars on bottle service and went out to get other people to come inside and pay $5 and told no reentry. Worst service I've ever had. Bull. Close them down!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__1	This place is crap. I hate going in here is always a mess and in the last two months I've been here probably five times for money orders and every single time they say they can't do any money services. They probably got their money handling services revoked. I try to never go here. Terrible terrible.
__label__1	I just spent 27.08 on three carne asada tortas, including a 5 dollar tip. I repeatedly said no mayonaise, and guess what? They still put freaking mayonnaise on all three of them. I saw the employee put no mayo on the computer, yet it still had it. If I had order just one, I wouldn't have been upset. However, having bought three, only to have mayo slathered over all of the tortas when I clearly iterated and reiterated NO MAYO, it made me even more super disappointed. I'll post the picture too.
__label__1	service =  made RESERVATIONS at 5:30 wasn't seated until 6:30... haha i'm hangry my mans!
__label__1	I was a regular orderer from this place through Uber Eats. I ordered almost every day.  I ordered Larges on the items and would repeatedly get smalls (but pay for the Larges). I would sometimes get the the large so I was well aware of what a Large looked like. Last order from this place. All I can say is beware and maybe think about somewhere else to order, which is what I am going to do. BAD BUSINESS for sure.
__label__1	The food here is always fantastic! My wife and I are regulars. On the past 3 visits, the service has been extremely poor. From the hostesses complaining about having to go outside to show us to our seats, to the wait staff spilling salsa all over my wife (with no apology), this last visit pushed me to write this review. Please fix the service so we can return to one of our favorite spots.
__label__1	do not go here. unless you fancy being ripped off. they will quote you one price & triple it once all is said & done. then when you get home & inspect your vehicle, you will realize that they didn't even do the work that you paid them to do. we paid them to fix the front & back breaks, but they only fixed the front. $400+ down the drain. do not trust them. they didn't even deserve one star.
__label__1	Decent food. Literally the worst service I have ever come across. I have had about 10 terrible experiences at is location. Each time I think they are playing a joke on me. I guess they stay open because of idiots like me who hope it is just a fluke. My husband waited an hour for our online order tonight, and naturally it was missing a few things. Never again.
__label__1	I have twice requested a quote for the replacement of a timing belt on my vehicle.  Once approxiately 3 months ago via phone and again 24 hours ago via instant chat.  Guess what?  No one has ever gotten back with me.  I guess I will take my car to Hallmark Hyundai or Wilson County Hyundai.  Maybe they would like my business.
__label__1	Same lame answer that you gave my last review and to many other people with a bad review. You're as useless as your staff
__label__1	Worst customer service. I would give this zero stars if possible. The individuals who work here said they were trying to do their job but they were plain rude and insulting. I should have read the other reviews before visiting. I wont be going back.
__label__1	"Very rude male waiters. They don't wear name tags so didn't get the name of our waiter. He didn't give a crap about our party of 5. 

Ignored us, very rushed, not relax, so stuck up it ruined the whole vibe. The manager didn't even care when we expressed our concerns, even after they ruined our order no one cared and had to force a sorry out of them. 

Once we spoke Spanish to them then they said sorry. 

What a joke! 

Manager and male waiters are complete A holes!"
__label__1	Absurdly pricey and they don't even have basil. I hate this place so much.
__label__1	Food was overpriced and not great. The beer was not good either. The stout was the most acceptable. Brittany our waitress was excellent. So for her I would have given this place 4 stars, but I noticed blonde was misspelled on the wall so 1 star.
__label__1	Waaaaay over priced. $386-486 range to hang exterior door. I told them I would pay $250, which is a fair price and Alan hung up on me. I found that Home Depot will do it for $280. Lee Company also has handyman services and will charge $90/hour. I cannot imagine it taking more than 2 hours, so hopefully only $180. Will update when job is complete.
__label__1	This is the worst McDonald's ever! Orders are never right, they park every car, and lines are always long. I will no longer come here and I would encourage you to find somewhere else to eat.
__label__1	I can't give a zero so had to give one star. Please do not go there. They are ALL lies. They only work with good credit not bad credit like they say. If you have bad credit expect to have $5000 +down payment. Their zero down a LIE ,their as low as $495 down is a LIE their home I'd guarantee credit is only if you have $5000+ deposit. Run fast away
__label__1	"Ehh - nothing special.  Just an overpriced pizza place.  

Go to Pizza City next door and support a business that has been local and loyal to Wyndmoor and is delicious.

If you want beer or wine with your pizza, try Chestnut Hill Brewery - just 5 mins away and great beer and pizza.  They just started offering salads too and they are the best."
__label__1	I had the supreme crunch wrap and it tastes like someone used the ingredients in a shitty bowling alley to make this, severely disappointed. Awful, the only good about Taco Bell is the baja blast.
__label__1	"It used to be good - what happened?
Prices have gone up, service and food quality have gone down. 
Beyond that, there isn't much to report. 
This is a consensus between friends, and neighbors, too. What a shame, we used to like to meet there a lot during their first and even second year open."
__label__1	Trying to get test scheduled,this is day 12,no one will return call.when I call they take message,but does not do any good.dont know what to do. This is the worst office,that I have been to in my 64 years.
__label__1	This place should be closed down went for restaurant week food was low grade dog food  terrible.  Complained and they were laughing in the open kitchen they took the food off the bill which really didn't matter.  I got sick as a dog on my way home. Bad chicken.  If you want ty have an open kitchen it should be spotless and the help should not look like they just got off their day job this looked dingy dirty unorganized    I don't do these reviews often but this was bad
__label__1	Meat was really overcooked, extremely salty, and just plain not good-not to mention overpriced. Incredibly disappointing.
__label__1	The food is okay. I can taste a lot of MSG in the food! I am always thirsty after eating their food. Twice we found a bug in the rice and they wouldn't give us a refund. It was terrible customer service.
__label__1	The apartments are really small for the price. They add on a trash pick up fee regardless if you want it or not. The tubs are painted so it looks brand new, once you start using it, the paint chips off and looks nasty. There is also not enough parking in some areas. They added cameras to some areas but they are cheap and poor quality. My brand new car was scratched up by someone and we were not able to even tell what happened to it on the video. Worst apartments I've ever lived in.
__label__1	Slow and hateful customer service no space to eat I hate this place never again will I eat here food was cold and was missing Most of the meal
__label__1	Unfortunately the last several times I have been shopping in the market there has been an employee stocking the shelves without wearing his mask over his nose. It is really not my responsibility to monitor their employees, it is the responsibility of management. The aisles of the store are extremely narrow and this is absolutely not safe. There are between 6 to 10 people dying a day in Bucks County from Covid.
__label__1	false advertisement, i bought wellness insurance for my dogs for 26 dollars per month each, and the cap for each item is very very low, nowhere close to what I pay to my vet, what was worse they will not pay as they claimed in brochure, they literaaly did not refund one single cent for my dog's wellness exam, not to mention deworming and heartworm prevention, nor flea prevention, which were all supposed to be covered. WTF is the point for wellness insurance if nothing is covered? Scumbags
__label__1	Amazing people! I loved all of them but they just honestly can't do nails unless they're just lazy, I literally asked for 2 simple things on both hands and feet and they didn't achieve the color i wanted on my toes or fingers. I was the last one out so my nails were rushed sadly. I paid $80 just to have to pay another $30 to get them fixed again. I won't ever be back.
__label__1	Overly crowded, one bartender, name tag said EJ, was actually yelling and cussing at us when ordering our drinks. Spoke to at least 3 different people to complain and absolutely nothing was done. TERRIBLE service. Wont ever be coming back to this crappy bar.
__label__1	This place is a structural disaster waiting to happen.. go in the basement and check out the floor support
__label__1	Too bad! Everything need to pay~ we just call n ask something, they change the line all the way... What's worst , they cut my line~ I m ok! But no more next time~
__label__1	We tried this Pizza Hut because of they had a special on medium pizzas. We bought a 5 topping pizza and when we opened it we realized that they put maybe 2 pieces of each topping on it and did not put sauce on the entire pizza. I asked for my money back and had to return the entire pizza and then was told I was too picky. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PLACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__1	Used to love it but really going downhill. Awful steak and the stingiest salad I've ever been served. Iceberg ain't that expensive. It comes across as stingy.
__label__1	The service is horrible. Asked for a frittia without onions and it came with extra onions and very oily. Made with too much butter. Had to sit for too long for order to be placed. I had to ask for more coffee. Le Bus in Manayunk is better. I am wondering if they are the same owners.  They  were all conglomerate in the back  standing over eating food and laughing instead of waiting on the customer. Will never come back that's for sure.
__label__1	If I could give them a 0 I would.  Confirmed the day before my scheduled appointment.  Stayed home and waited all afternoon and they never showed.  Many calls and messages but not 1 call back.  Beware of this company and stay away.
__label__1	Restaura Jammed tables on a Saturday night which caused  another guest to turn around and spill drinks all over us then ended up getting spilled all over a second time with a whole tray of margaritas - got bathe twice in one night and manager did not even come over and apologize.
__label__1	Horrible place. Rooms are not as advertised. Shoulda gone to best western two blocks away...dam non refundable reservation, thats how they got me
__label__1	Overpriced but the scenery is fun if you like to see grown men wearing khakis and shirts with little horsies and pink whales on them. Basically dressed like toddlers with overextended credit.
__label__1	"I challenge you to go to the bread aisle and on the bottom shelf behind the cheap ""Enriched White"" bread and tell me what you see.  It's nothing but garbage and filth.  This disgusted me so much that I put all of my groceries back and left.  Do not shop here."
__label__1	If you want raw beef in your beef fried rice and then be refused a refund this is the place for you. We got it delivered then they expected me to come up there food in hand for my refund. We have been loyal customers and this is just ridiculous. So here's your picture and i expect my money back. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE.
__label__1	Not sure if my family's experience is typical for this restaurant but we will not be back. Server was MIA, food was cold and we had to ask for parmesan cheese for our spaghetti and mayo for a burger- 10 minutes after the food was placed on the table by the kitchen staff.
__label__1	This is nothing but shady con people at this place sales and service all they want is your money and will do nothing to help people out only help themselves.
__label__1	Food was so terrible, I was a bit late and there was a buffet, there were only few items to the list which isn't a problem. I took the Biryani and literally I couldn't find one single piece of Mutton in it. I told an employee out there, he surprised me saying that it's not my mistake. I was standing and waiting alone and three employees rushing in and out, I had to call and  ask them to take the bill. I understand it was a long day for them but what about the customer, if you cannot provide the service better close it early.
__label__1	"Anyone that given this restaurant over a one star must either work there or be relatives of the owner.  This place sucks.  Im not sure why they call this Italian food, or any edible food for that matter.  I asked them about it and they said it was true ""Northern Italian"" food, but I know this isnt true."
__label__1	"This place is garbage and an insult to anything that should be considered special. If you're planning your wedding here, don't bother. Valle Vista wants your money and nothing else. You are a paying customer in their venue and not a guest. 

Refer to Linda G's review in 2013, ""this place is nothing but a wedding mill."" is a 100% accurate statement and in four years nothing has changed."
__label__1	NO STARS! Still no phone over a week almost 2 weeks. Given the runaround by every single person you speak to.This company should be sued!!! They take your deductible and then leave you without a phone for up to weeks or longer, as I was told yesterday that might be the case is just 100% unethical and crazy. No one is helping nor do they care.  Customer service is honestly a joke. I despise this company. Please don't ever use this company!!!!!!
__label__1	Don't waste your time here. The sales associates are rude and couldn't care less about customer service. I never got a hello or welcome or any offer for help. When I went to pay the sales associates didn't say anything but the total with her hand out.
__label__1	"Bad experience today! Asked to try on $99 pair of skates for my son, the guy brought them out and they fit so we planned to purchase them. After waiting for nearly an hour for baking and sharpening, we get to the register and are told ""oops sorry these are the $170 pair"".  Obviously his mistake, he just looks at us, like are you buying them?? Obviously we left furious!"
__label__1	"1 star is far too many for this location. This is by far the worst Hardee's location there is. There has been times I've gotten there in the morning and they have a homemade sign on the door saying ""lobby closed, drive thru only."" I work nearby so I've frequently visited this location thinking ""it can't be as bad as the last time"" and it always is! Need to start from scratch with staff. New manager, new employees, new everything!"
__label__1	This DD has gone down & the employees need to smile & be friendly to the drive thru customers, personally I'm happy there is another DD by me & little north of this one. I haven't been in the store lately, think Ill stick with my DD js
__label__1	Worst wait in America! Holy Jesus it take a 90 minutes to get a taco! Unreal!!!!!!!!!!
__label__1	I went in for the SNS dip powder for my fingernails March 2020 and ended up with nail fungus on five nails. See pics below of four of the nails. Please save your money and time and go somewhere else. The nail tech also did not disinfect any of the tools and just pulled them out of a drawer. Unfortunately, they are closed now due to COVID, so I was not able to call them.
__label__1	There's no kitchen at this location, and the food just sits out all day.
__label__1	"Bought a gift card here less than a year ago. Went to use it this weekend and was told ""we no longer accept gift cards here you can use it in New Hope""  we did try to reason with the workers saying we bought it at this location and don't visit new hope often and should be able to use it here considering this is the location the money was given to. They insisted that they would not take the gift card even though we purchased it at this location. Extremely disappointed and will not be returning."
__label__1	"I will say this is the best ice cream I've ever had, but after two experiences now with the same god-awful MISERABLE service, I won't be back. From reading the other reviews, I'm pretty sure I encountered the same person behind the counter that many have commented on. Just inexplicably rude, hostile, and surly. No attempt at basic human courtesy from this young lady. 

Seems like a great brand with a super product, but why hire mean, nasty people?"
__label__1	First off, I am not one to leave a review. But, this was the worst service imaginable. They never picked up the phone! I believe this place is a scam based off of its reviews and service. Stay away.
__label__1	We turned in our leased vehicle this past Saturday. We circulated around the show room hoping to get someone's attention as we were looking to discuss getting another car. Nothing!  The reception desk was no manned and several sales people passed by without not so much as eye contact.  This is the second time we've visited showroom to look at cars without any sort of sales contact. We are 30 year BMW people. Our next stop was Tampa Mercedes.  I also wrote an email to the contact us on the webpage. Nor response.
__label__1	"Just attempted to check in to a room I reserved 3 months ago to find out they gave the room to ""more important guests!"" However, they were accommodating enough (insert sarcastic tone here) to get us a room downtown. Unacceptable! If I wanted to stay downtown, I would have made a reservation myself. Will never stay here because they treat certain guests like second class citizens. Never stay here! Instead book a room downtown."
__label__1	a lot of fabricated compliments about the food being good , i strongly believe they paid someone family/friends to write these fabricated good co
__label__1	"There is not enough dryers for customers.  Several are broken and the management uses most of them for its wash and fold business.  Limited seating also is an issue.  If you can find anywhere else to do your laundry, go there.

The reviews of Boole D. and Alexander G. are spot on."
__label__1	"I had a great time, the food was delicious and prices were reasonable.

And then came the aftermath. I ordered oxtail noodle soup and the meat was bad; I wound up getting a serious case of food poisoning from it. I spent all weekend with a high fever, complete with vomiting and dry-heaving. My dinner companion did not have the oxtail and was completely fine. I spent all weekend hugging the toilet or lying under 4 different blankets shaking.

I liked this place, but it's been ruined for me. :("
__label__1	"I ordered the prosciutto caprese pizza. It was the worst thing I've ever seen. Pale frozen dough, bad prosciutto, poor and flavorless ""fresh mozarella"", burnt basil, and garlic salt everywhere. Really offensive food. I don't know how this place gets enough money for a commercial. I hope this place closes and bad things happen to everyone who works there. Unacceptable."
__label__1	This target has the most abhorrent employees of any target I have ever been to.  We have had a horrible experience here before while shopping but this time we orders online and picked up at customer service thinking it wouldn't be as bad.  We were wrong.  The associate asked for our information and put it into the computer then walked away.  I've picked up at other targets and it usually takes 5 minutes, it was twice as long here.  Not all employees here are useless but the majority we have come into contact with.  It is a shame because there is potential but customer service is very lacking.
__label__1	Great service and decent bar, food is mediocre at best.
__label__1	Horrible job and horrible customer service.  Do NOT recommend.  My lashes were super long but also sparse.  Huge holes in between the lashes.
__label__1	"This was my first time in the city and I went to check it out to eat. As I came in to place, not even a hello. The hostess was on the phone and could not even say ""hello, welcome, can you please give me a minute?"" Nope not even eye contact. 1st impression says a thousand words. Headed to La Bamba."
__label__1	Kitchen Manager decides to close whole restaurant at 9 pm when posted close time is 10 pm.  This sucks.  I've been a loyal customer for a long time and have spent a lot of my money at this place. YOU GUYS REALLY REALLY SUCK!!!! Sorry but that's the cold hard fact. You sick as a restaurant.
__label__1	ATI practices lousy billing. Do not take their word that they have checked your insurance, and you are covered for X amount of visits. They will try to bill you a year later and try to make you pay out of pocket. Find another PT as this place is a sham. Also, they provide half-ass service. They want to milk the insurance, and they won't care about your health. Trust me, go elsewhere. I have let me doctor know and they will not refer anyone there any longer.
__label__1	I took a Michelin PR4 to be mounted on my rear wheel. The tech used some type of solvent to take the wheel weights off and it ruined the paint. As if that wasn't bad enough he scratched up my rim pretty bad trying to break the bead on the tire. I will never recommend this place to anyone for anything!
__label__1	"I ordered a loaded potato soup and it tasted like it went south, I order the Fajitas steaks and chicken and they came in over seasoned, the wraps were all stuck to get her in a roll and had some purple onions in them. And I don't eat onions, the chicken was no edible since it was too seasoned and the steak should have been tender and I found it tasing ""funky""- not the best  location by far!!  Trying for brownies - they just have to plate it so it should be good"
__label__1	After 30 minutes I had no food. Called up there to find out what was going on and they said it would be another 15minutes to get the driver to the store. Maybe have more than one delivery driver on Saturdays? Next time I'm just getting a pizza. 45+ wait isn't worth a sandwich
__label__1	No atmosphere.  Took an unusally long time for the food to arrive.  Wife saw cook leave the kitchen several times and never washed hands when returning.  Her food was luke warm.  The pasta that was supposed to be part of my meal was not as advertised on the menu.  Better Mexican resturants in Tucson.  Save your money.
__label__1	Terrible, slow service only one person was working. Under cooked chicken wings and waffles. Did not provide the entire order I paid for, missing a side. Brisket was dry. Never going back again. Thiscplace will not last long. They are going to make people sick.
__label__1	"Awful experience at this location. I have been to other Baystar resturant Group locations and this visit has truly put a bad taste in my mouth due to the lack of consistency.
Very disappointed, with staff and manager at this location on handling a problem with quality of food served."
__label__1	"I found myself wanting a simple quesarito after a long day at work so I met up with my fiancé at TB. My fiancé stood in line for 10 minutes and was never acknowledged by staff. We decided that the wait was too long for a Taco Bell wait and we didn't want to end up being the other couples in the establishment who all looked disappointed as they waited for their food to *hopefully* come. 

In the end we decided to go to jack in the box just a mile up the road where we were greeted right away and served with a flavorful burger in a timely manner!"
__label__1	Absolutely horrible. At no other time have I ever walked into a sushi restaurant and immediately thought I should go.  I should have listened to my inner voice and walked out.  The service was lacking, the sushi was blah and the whole place just smelled like fish.  I will not be back in.
__label__1	Never do business again with these guys!! Service guy was a complete joke, rude and could care less about my issues. Had a couple questions and he couldn't even answer 1!!!To many other dealer s who want your business in town.
__label__1	So slow.it takes 30 minutes for the drinks to come out.it takes 1 hour for the food to come out.not for toddlers,the waiters do dances like every 5 minutes and can't seem to get your food out! Written by an unsatisfied 9 year old
__label__1	Poor quality food, this place is far from Mexican quality food. The tortilla soup was horrible. This establishment should be closed down immediately or changed its name to The Microwave Food Factory!!!!
__label__1	Nothing you need is ever in stock. Cashiers take FOREVER. Never enough employees staffed. It's the worst. Spend the 10 minutes extra to go to Target.
__label__1	"This place has horrible customer service. I asked to talk to the ""manager""and she gave me no help. Very bad business people. They used to have great food....sorry to say ..no more.I could deal with a bad meal if a bad night ..these people seem to have many bad nights..they do not care about their food or how it tastes to the rest of us.."
__label__1	The business owner here is an absolute jerk. He is thinks he walks on water and treats others like complete trash. Do not support this business. I've never met someone more rude in my entire life.
__label__1	Terrible! I ordered the falafel and it took 45 minutes. The falafel lacked  tahini sauce and the falafel was over fried. There were customers that were served immediately , ate and had paid their bill while I was still waiting for my falafel. I used to work in a Greek restaurant  and fried tons of falafel in 20 minutes.
__label__1	This establishment clearly does not care about the well-being of the community. Despite a global pandemic and a mask mandate, I saw three employees and several customers without masks today. I was excited about the idea of buying furniture from this store but cannot support a place with no regard for the safety of their customers.
__label__1	I usually love potstickers. But these are quite possibly the worst tasting potstickers I've had in my entire life. It's like minced dry meat paste and no amount of soy dipping sauce can fix it
__label__1	Got turned away during lunch because one of the guys was wearing a PAC sun sleeveless shirt!!!! This is casual dining in French quarter last time I checked!!! Highly pissed off!!!
__label__1	"Many of us ate here and one kid got sick - the only kid who had chocolate milk and he puked it all up a couple of hours later.

Called the manager and she said the milk expired the day it was served. She was very friendly and offered to remove them all. But considering I've been here twice in the past 5 years and someone got sick both times, I think we'll avoid this location on the very rare occasion we patronize McDonald's."
__label__1	This is my first time ever to buy a mattress and it was a very bad experience. I bought sleepy's and I had to exchange it 3 times because of the surface keep floating which is a manufacture defect. Then, the manager gave me a free upgrade to the next level Sleepy's and here I am the same problem. I sent emails and I called they never returned to my calls. So if you were lucky you will get a good mattress. PS: I paid over a $1000 for this mattres.
__label__1	Only giving 1 star because I have to! Do not waste your time here! Way over priced and there isn't much to do! I came today for the first time and was so disappointed! Wait times for the rides are close to 2 hours and that's if the ride is even open! Today after standing in line for over an hour, the ride was cancelled for technical issues. This wasn't 1 ride but 2 different rides! I was there 6 hours and got to ride 1 thing! I will not be back.
__label__1	We (My husband, 2 kids and myself) stopped there for lunch today.  As soon as we walked in the door,  an awful smell assaulted our nostrils.  We were seated but decided to leave before ordering as the odor was grossing us all out.  My 12 year old complained that the smell made her stomach hurt.  If I had to identify the odor, I would say it was a mix between an old, musty, mildewy, mouse-infested house and a sewer plant.  We will not go back.
__label__1	Had fond memories of it from when I was in school.  Sadly, Pod has gone down hill.  The pod where we sat had gross hand smudges all over the walls from all the people tapping the pods.  The floors had dirt in the corners.  The bathroom smelled like a subway bathroom.  The place was so gross, I had no appetite for the $19 Pad Thai I ordered.
__label__1	"I was there last night, and had the seafood enchilada. I heated up the leftovers tonight, and while I was cutting it, pulled out a 1 1/2"" cotton pad from the enchilada! That's disgusting, and I will NEVER go there again.  I'm going to report them to the Health Department, as well. If I could give it negative stars, I would. Stay away!!"
__label__1	About two weeks ago I went to sushi Rose because my children wanted to take me there for my birthday well all six of us got food poisoning I'll never go back
__label__1	Walked in and was told to sit anywhere yet waited 10 minutes for a waitress to give me a menu and only after I asked a guy bussing a table to send someone over. I ordered the shredded beef taco combo....blan beans, pre-made taco shells and the rice was dry. For sure not going back but very disappointing given the star rating!
__label__1	"I wish i had 0 starts to give to this place. The worst pedicure ever!!!
I was rushed in and then had to wait while the attendant did my nails at the same time she was doing 2 more people. She applied so many coats that the color was too dark, and polish spotted all over my toes. Then she added the top coat too fast, resulting in bubbles on every nail: DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE!!!!
Awful service, poor quality work. Not worth your $20 or the time."
__label__1	"The fries were so cold the crisped ones were soggy. Trying to eat them anyway caused them to be returned to the air - gah!

The chicken nuggets were lukewarm.

The soda was nice and cold though!

The drive thru ordering process was hampered by no one at the payment window and a huge line of customers both inside and outside. However, the bad food means this gets crossed off my list."
__label__1	I saw a training cashier girl and she was figuring everything out. Her manager was staring her down and you could tell she was getting nervous. Management needs to be better. This was a couple weeks ago but now I got the chance to write this. I have a cousin who used to work there and said the management has favorites. He also said that one of the main managers would get irritated really easy and give a bad attitude.
__label__1	The worst shipping company ever. Looks like they hire anybody. I have had my packages stolen, lost and never got delivered. The customer service is horrible. They are stealing packages there's no other explanation.
__label__1	I will not be back!! The lady made a mistake, took my gift certificate, and charged me alot more money than the service should have been. Then she wanted me to come back the next day to fix her mistake.  Forget that! They use to be good.
__label__1	"I actually liked this sushi, but the service was awful. I ordered delivery from here three times. The first TWO times they forgot to include the drink I ordered. The third time, it look nearly 2 HOURS to deliver the food. And we're talking fresh fish here (though probably not fresh anymore after sitting in a heated car or in the restaurant for that long). 

Really bad. Avoid delivery from this place. They just cannot execute."
__label__1	Long lines, and you never get what you ordered.  This should close down until they get more competent employees.
__label__1	Asked for French tip regular manicure and the white tip lines were so rushed, not even. Pictures included, this picture was take 20 minutes after leaving you can see how the line isn't straight. Over painted and didn't clean it up around the nail bid. Very very sloppy job. Save your time and go somewhere else. And this was when they weren't even busy, so it's not like I went at a bad time. They are just trash tbh
__label__1	Easily the worst customer service experience I have ever encountered. Nightmare material.
__label__1	"Ack! There are bugs in my soup for real. Little flies. In an attempt to recover my meal, I transitioned to another dish where I found moldy cabbage. I'm not above peeling the moldy leaves off a cabbage and digging for the still ok to eat bits, but please don't stick the moldy leaves in my dinner. 
Move along, cowboys, move along. There is other Chinese delivery to be had near campus."
__label__1	I'm so disappointed in eating this pizza. Ordered 3 large mushroom pizzas and 3 fries. The pizzas were COLD, not even warm. The fries weren't even cooked, very mushy. The pizza was so plain with absolutely no flavor. It had no sauce, barely any cheese. It was so chewy and the crust was almost rock hard. It was very tough to chew. Definitely not worth the money!
__label__1	This company was sent by American Home Shield. These folks are a real fraud! They work with AHS to rip people off their money. I will be filing a lawsuit shortly and would rather keep my review short but I would like to warn people in advance. Please do not become a victim!
__label__1	"They had my car towed there to fix a problem that was not fixed at the other location downtown... they did fix the problem. however, in the process they managed to break my gear shift off the steering column. 410 dollars to fix. and when they fixed the problem that was originally needing fixed, they busted the brake line. 200 dollars.  now my car is in worse shape. when i confronted them about it they say they didnt do it?????

DO NOT GO THERE!!!!!!!!!!"
__label__1	"The food was some of the worst I've ever had. The salad was wilted and the dressing was sour. The manager freely admitted that it had been prepared the day before. The green beans were overcooked and too salty. The steak had an odd smell and taste. The gravy tasted disgusting and had the texture of glue. The manager said they put a ""flavoring agent"" in it whatever that means."
__label__1	"Just got out of movie with two kids. Infestation of ants in the cup holders in theater 12 and let guest services know on the way out. Her response was ""thanks for letting us know-- they should be gone by this time of year!"" That's disgusting and also terrible customer service. Kids couldn't sit still-- jumping around because of the ants. Bad experience."
__label__1	This place just opened and I highly doubt it will remain open. The girl who took my order today was incredibly rude and I actually walked out and didn't even continue my order. She had a very bad attitude and service was terrible. Very disappointed.
__label__1	Gone twice, and for some reason they can't figure out what I want. Definitely never going back !
__label__1	Comida sin nada de sabor, toda mi familia salio con dolor de estomago..lo siento pero jamas volvere
__label__1	Rude, inexperienced staff and always out of White mocha.Had to make my drink three times and still did not get it right.
__label__1	Big fan of the chain. Went to this new location for lunch, but walked out and went next door to Zoe's Kitchen instead. 4 staff behind the counter were all inattentive. Couldn't get their attention to place an order. They were joking around and oblivious. Management better get their act together.
__label__1	We were walk-ins. other people came in after us without a appointment and we're helped first. After 3 hours we were finally done. Place is filthy and 150.00 for 2 mani and pedi's. Just asinine. Will never go back
__label__1	This is probably the worst sushi I have ever had. It did not taste fresh at all. I got the all you can eat and literally nothing was good. The baked roll was cold. They brought me a fried roll when it said it was not. I recommend that you do not eat the sushi here.
__label__1	They r very rude , and basically told me they don't do full sets !!!! All the gells are empty I was told we don't use gell it's all dip..... this place used to be good it really fell off I will take my business elsewhere .....
__label__1	"Last month the carwash broke while I was inside.  My vehicle was trapped for 10 minutes.  The manager told me to bring back my receipt a wash.   When I returned, a new manager refused to honor the wash, saying it was ""against company policy"" and the old manger was fired for being a gun to the carwash. Yikes!    The new manager acted like I was trying to steal a wash, in my luxury vehicle, with my kid in the back.  He really offended me and permanently lost my business.  I highly encourage others to avoid this carwash."
__label__1	ONE star because theres no choice for ZERO .. wanted a nice cold brew drink, they didn't have the white mocha syrup it included, ordered their current special (kiwi star fruit refresher) they didn't have the star fruit syrup for it. Lost my patience, stuck in drive thru, avoid this Starbucks at all costs!!!
__label__1	"These rude, arrogant clowns, IMO, must be buying decent looking junkers from the auction... then prettying them up and selling them to unsuspecting Tucsonans...  they didn't even return my calls... lucky for me!  The one star reviews are legit, the good ones are most likely family and/or shills.  If you are dumb enough to shop here, take your attorney and demand a decent warranty.  Better yet...

AVOID this fly-by-night junkyard."
__label__1	I was here with my disabled girlfriend and they told me I had to go back to my table instead of helping her back from the bathroom when she couldn't get back alone. Bald Manager is on a power trip, rest of staff is solid.
__label__1	Husband and I got sick eating here. Too bad because it tasted great.
__label__1	"Greasy broth topping was good but broth really greasy couldn't eat
Other then that great depth maybe would be better with vegetable broth .will try again was very sad was really in mood for food"
__label__1	We visited for the first time this week for an all ages event with our nieces and nephews. The manager/bartender seemed to be having a very bad day.  He was very upset about serving juice boxes and let everyone know about his displeasure.  We saw him raise his voice and use foul language in front of kids when he was upset with another customer at the end of the evening.
__label__1	Beyond Stupid.   Express scripts is probably the worst business I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with.  Truly idiots.
__label__1	Worst fast food experience I've ever had. Burger was raw in middle and not edible. Frosty was so runny was sloshing around in cup and warm.   Person taking order screwed it up  and gave us wrong kind of salad.  Don't stop here. I would give it negative stars if I could.
__label__1	Way overpriced, $16 for a turkey sandwich, chips, and a small Snapple. Service was slow, not very friendly. Won't be going back.
__label__1	What a poorly run excuse of a public market.  Most of the original stores are long gone.  Management is almost as difficult to find a nearby by parking space.  With so many great things to do in Santa Barbara like the Funky and Fun Zone, I don't know why anyone would waste their time at SBPM.  Never again for me!
__label__1	Poor value, high prices, bad service, clams were a small portion and the broth was way too salt heavy.  My water was empty 70% of my stay and I was 1 of 5 people in the restaurant with about 5 staff members standing around, doing nothing.  Weak all around.
__label__1	If I could give zero stars, then I would. I'd rather eat any chain pizza than eat here, and I hate chains. It's within walking distance from my work & it's not even an option.
__label__1	Rude rude rude. Saturday 3/28/20 woman at front was rude, not compassionate and did I mention rude. Asked me if I called ahead. Uhm it's urgent care. That's the whole point - walk in. I understand coronavirus has people on edge, but that doesn't mean you have to be a terrible person. I ended up walking out because I didn't feel comfortable that I would get appropriate care. Hopefully this can be passed along so she would get some additional training.
__label__1	"They don't accept competitor coupons, they have said I needed to repair items that I know didn't need to be repaired.  I went their yesterday needing an oil change and some work on my brakes.  The quote for the oil change was $20 MORE than I have ever paid there before (and I was using my Firestone card).  I asked why the price was more and he said they must have been undercharging me.  I walked to Dobbs right next door and they did everything and MORE for less that the quote from Firestone.  

My recommendation is to go someplace else."
__label__1	No call from the supervisor and I got a letter from the credit agency today saying I have to pay the cancellation fee plus penalties.  Horrible company
__label__1	Went to watch the NFL draft and grab some beers. Ordered an IPA and received a Guinness. The waitress did not offer to get me something else after I did not take a drink of it for 30 minutes. Then I ordered a different beer and it wasn't right either. Never offered to get me the right one. Never tried to make anything right. I was nice the entire time and she was super rude. Won't be back again.
__label__1	Food was cold and tasted like out of a can. Service  slow and rude. Do not recommend. Many other places around that are much better.
__label__1	"I watched the truck roll up to my house and not take items next to the bin for the third pick up in a row that  a help desk representative told me would be picked up after I'd called the last 2 times. I called for a third time and I was told that if it isn't in the bin, it won't be picked up, but if it doesn't fit in the bin, they won't take it.

Republic Services, what can you help me with if it's not hauling away recycling and trash.....?"
__label__1	Although the food was decent, pay with cash...A group of us went there and they charged a few of our credit cards for the meals that day and again for some random amounts a few months later.  The food was not worth the hassle of canceling the card.
__label__1	We were extremely disappointed by our experience with Mojo. My friend and I ordered the cookie dough ice cream sandwich and mine was noticeably smaller than hers. For a $6 ice cream I really expected a lot more, and it was especially disappointing in comparison. The dough was frozen but you could not wait for it to thaw because the ice cream melted too fast. In all, a very poor experience and I could not recommend this to anyone.
__label__1	This place is terrible. It is a tourist trap. Food was blah and cold. The cashier was really great. Bartender was meh, he didn't announce who had what beer. Confusing interaction. They messed up our sides, the staff didn't care or help. They were supposed to bring correct sides never came. Managers a B.S.er didn't care about our complaints. Not worth the visit or the money. Save your money and go somewhere else.
__label__1	Horrible service !!!! Overpriced food, that i not very good. First time in new orleans, thought we would get get a nice meal, but was i wrong.
__label__1	Yesterday all of Tampa Bay and several other cities lost all internet. This is the 2nd time in 2 months. Verizon was no issue but now it's almost time to go back to Brighthouse
__label__1	Staff can be a bit clownish with an attitude at night shells are always stale and you will find yourself waiting a long time. Gone in during the day difference between day and night. if you plan on eating here may I advise you only eat there during the day and eat in otherwise save your money and go to the one on aramingo avenue service never disappoints
__label__1	My husband and I live in town. Why we keep going back. Don't know. But we're done. We went for brunch. I wanted pancakes. Who can mess up pancakes. When I got them they were stiff like card board not fluffy. They must have been left from breakfast. I refused them I want fresh pancakes. We are always disappointed at Rosie's dinner. Everyone says nasty food. There sports bar next to Rosie's has fantastic food. We're done at Rosie's.
__label__1	Why can't they answer their damn phone? Why doesn't their website work? I have been trying to transfer money to them for weeks and no progress has been made. Horrible customer service!!!
__label__1	Checked out on a sun morning in a hurry and left my iPad on bed. Called next morning to have them send it to me an of course no iPad was found. Awesome. Not a bad place just remember all your belongings. And too the thief who stole it. Karma is a bitch my friend
__label__1	Very incompetent employees and manager, after THREE attempts at making 4 sandwiches and wasting a half hour I finally decided to leave. I've never had any problems with any other Jersey Mike's location so it comes down to incompetent managerial staff not training their staff properly. Don't waste your time here, find a different location.
__label__1	The food is OKAY, but the 1 star is because they took money from me. I signed my credit card slip with a $5.00 tip, then received an email from Square saying I gave an $8.00 tip. I know I wrote it clearly (I also wrote out the total correctly). Tried calling back twice (no response), left a message and my number to ask about it and clarify - no call back. I'm just going to be avoiding here from now on.
__label__1	Customer service upon check in is terrible.  Rooms are ok, but noisy.  Beds are comfortable.
__label__1	I got food poisoning from the noodle bar in Parx. Puked and shit my brains out for 24 hours. Will never go back
__label__1	Did not like this place at all. Rude and nasty service. Will never come back to this dump om Bourban again.
__label__1	Rude receptionists. Inconvenient office hours: close an hour during lunch, close at 5, 6pm except on Tues at 8 pm and 1 pm on Friday. Close on weekend. They gave my husband and my son first cleaning appointment 3 and 1/2 month away in October. They said they have 4 hygienists. Haha. Each one works each day?
__label__1	"Dry as hell, over cooked chicken tender sandwiches.

Bland, undercooked collard greens.

Not worth the stop - maybe go get a smoothie instead and hope you're landing near better food. 

The ""seasoning"" seems to be the hot sauce on your table. So... not as all what I would call ""Nashville Hot Chicken."""
__label__1	Horribly disappointed with the service department. I scheduled an appointment in advance for an oil change and tire rotation. 3 1/2 hours later and I'm still sitting here with no update on the status of my vehicle.
__label__1	I can't tell you anything about the pizza because I tried to order one at 8:30 on a Friday and they told me they closed at 7:30?! The guy blamed it on corona but it's Sept. 4th. I don't know if I'll try again another day, I just spent 40 minutes reading their reviews here and on google just to be thorough so, yeah I'm mad.
__label__1	Terribly slow and pretty rude. Putting donuts in boxes ain't rocket science. Walk in customers all but ignored.
__label__1	Terrible. Overrun with pretentious yuppies, babies and dogs. No point in standing in line for small portions that are overpriced. I left and had dinner elsewhere. Good idea, terrible execution.
__label__1	"If you are a young adult or have children, DO NOT let them come to this hole in the wall. The goofy ""security guard"" sexually harassed two of the girls I was with when we visited. There's a reason it's one of the only bars in the area that doesn't have a line to get in  - even the locals don't want to go."
__label__1	Guess I don't like NY pizza because this pizza was awful . Swimming in sauce and burnt on one side. May be NY's Best but is Wesley Chapel's worst.
__label__1	Bull riding was cool, but don't play in the Arcade. Beat the high score on the punching machine and they didn't have the prize in the machine as promised so they gave us the runaround on giving us the prize. Very unprofessional. Don't promise people a gift if you can't follow through.
__label__1	This place takes forever. Multiple instances where I have to wait 20-30 minutes for the food to be ready. They need step it up in all honesty. This place is poorly run. Don't come here if you're in a rush.
__label__1	I don't what happened to this location. It used to be the best qdoba near my house. In the past year or so, it has really gone down. The dining area is used a storage area, which is a complete eye sore. The service is so inconsistent and half the time they close early due to staffing issues. And when they are open, the staff is all over the place. It's like no one knows what they need to be doing. I really hope that things turns around and soon, because at this rate they won't last long.
__label__1	Worst experience ever at an auto shop. They did fix the problem the car was brought in for (AC) but upon pick up the check engine light was on and the car idled rough and had hesitation. It never had idle or hesitation or check engine light issues before... I should also add that they had the car for a week as well?!? All this trouble with absolutely no accountability on their part was completely shocking. There are certainly better shops in town.
__label__1	Refused entry with a guest that had a service animal.  Try somewhere else - many great places in new hope other than this one that will let people into their establishment.
__label__1	Overpriced entrees and they must be overstaffed because while our meals were served in a timely fashion it was TOO soon. The bar staff on the deck are young and ignorant as well as rude. Drinks are overpriced but provides for a nice view of Pennsylvania landings.
__label__1	Worst BBQ in town. The meat was dry and flavorless. The Mac and cheese tasted like I was eating straight bread crumbs. The seasoned fries tasted like a salty dessert. I like sweet sauce but the sauce was way too sweet. Only good thing was the sweet tea. BJ's down the street is by far the better option for BBQ.
__label__1	"Worst service ever!!!! 45 min waiting time for a waitress.
Made reservation, the table wasn't ready. Needed to seat somewhere else. 
Waiter never showed up. After approaching and getting ""one second please"" as an answer. 
Eventually decided to leave they didn't care."
__label__1	Very disappointing customer experience. Could not get appts for several weeks. Then day of appt they called to say that insurance need third party approval. We said we would pay but they said we already gave appt away. They failed to file insurance info timely causing even more delay in getting needed MRI. They also never forwarded the results to the doctor. Plenty of other options for people and I would recommend you look at others.
__label__1	I've been punished because I'm a party of one.  Who knew when I entered Continental and asked for a table and not the bar I would be seated in the back room with screaming disobedient children who were completely unfamiliar with their inside voices and their less-than-concerned and way too tolerant parents.  I've been punished by Continental for my party-of-one status.  Shame, Continental, shame on YOU!!!
__label__1	I recently purchased a living social voucher.  I made an appointment for 11 am on Feb. 7, 2020.  I was going to a wedding that afternoon.  I arrived at the location the door was locked. I knocked several times.  Made 3 call to them.  Voice mail each time.  I waited 25 minutes. Still no return call.  This establishment let me down.
__label__1	I really thought racism was dead along with disco, but I found out it was alive and well here. Had an issue where all the of the patrons were treated differently than I was (and the two differences were I was spending money and I was not the same skin tone). When I tried to address the owner who told the employee to treat me this way I got the run around. I left to never return again. Way to ruin a girl's night out. Thanks Downeys!
__label__1	I walked a few mikes to get here only to find out they no longer specialize in breakfast, I have to say we were really disappointed with the food and the service. The best thing was the Bellini!
__label__1	My frozen tacos had to be nuked. Gross. Drove a mile home and they were frozen inside. Totally gross!!
__label__1	Was excited to try takeout from a new place . Very disappointing . Mushroom soup had very little taste  even after trying to salt and pepper it like crazy! Broccoli salad had hardly any broccoli . Not sure why it was called a broccoli salad with minimal broccoli . Prices high for mediocre food .
__label__1	literally NEVER OPEN WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE. I'm tired of it. I have never had their food because every time I go, even though their hours say they should be open, they just aren't. lazy lazy people never show up to work. Hate y'all. Go out of business ASAP
__label__1	Pretty gross when you open the ranch to put on your taco salad and there are 2 hairs in the container just staring at you. This place is unsanitary and disgusting. Sick.
__label__1	"Don't go there!  Super slow service, horribly over salted chips.  My fish tacos were dripping with water-apparently they were poorly defrosted and even more poorly cooked.  The server suggested next time I request additional tortillas to mop up the moisture!  
Once upon a time it was fun,  go to Nicos for better food and service!"
__label__1	too bad these drs care only $.s  & not pt care  this is valuable to a pt to have   dr be concerned of best care not the buck
__label__1	Stood there for 2 minutes while, I'm guessing, the one cashier ran around and did others things. Went across the street to McAlister's. Nbd.
__label__1	This place has workers who are not helpful when the kiosk are down. There should be someone to help ring up the order. And why does breakfast end so early!!!
__label__1	Very disappointing. Went today for vegan option after waiting 30 minutes in line there were no vegan options for protein. Although  they indicate they have vegan options they were out of all three at 1:00 this afternoon and said they would not be making anymore. I got charged for the bowls I purchased as though there was protein even though they didn't have it available and got up charged for the additional veggie. Not to mention the very poor customer service... complete rudeness. Won't be back
__label__1	"I was looking for a beer before I boarded my flight and this looked like the perfect place.  There was no host to greet you, but that didn't bother me since I just wanted to sit at the bar.  There were plenty of seats so that was no problem.  I waited for 5 minutes before one of the bartenders spoke to me and she said ""I see you looking around, I'll be there when I can.""  I promptly walked out and said no thanks.  Next time start with a hello or some kind of acknowledgement, then I won't have to look around."
__label__1	My straw wasn't sucking in my coke. I figured oh there's a  hole; I opened my large coke to find a blue piece of plastic. Absolutely disgusting!
__label__1	Bartender was too busy taking shots to serve her customers. Man shucking oysters was so sweet!
__label__1	Looking at prior reviews this probably won't help much. Crazy long wait to just pick up a game I already paid for.  And then get the 12 questions around memberships, preorders, insurance and DLC.  I'm in retail myself, and this experience makes me want to buy online.   Gotta be a way to speed this process up guys or people will just click and save the hassle
__label__1	I just attended a birthday party where Croc Encounters was scheduled to come.  Twice during the party the host got a call that Croc Encounters was running late. The second call was to say they couldn't come until a time 2 hrs after the party would have ended.  Sounded like they just didn't want to come or even cared.  Highly unprofessional and incredibly disappointing to ruin a child's birthday party without good cause. I've never been to the actual location, but this experience has definitely soured any desire to go.
__label__1	"This Staples is hood..

Cashier flat out said the word 'retarded' right in front of me and insisted on playing on her phone. No way I could remember her name. Clearly a management issue here.

Best of luck Staples!"
__label__1	"Guy showed up and claimed he could not even put gauges on my unit, told me I needed to replace unit without even a test if system. Says he was walking away. Got a company out, was low on Freon and he was able to get his gauges on and fixed unit. 

Rip off trying to sell new unit when mine is only 6 years old.

Stay away"
__label__1	Thursday I went for a pedi as my b-day gift to me. Sadly it was the worst pedi ever! The lady just didn't care except to get done quickly. The nails were cut at different lengths & shapes. Polish didn't go on right & was messed up. I'm not one to complain, but I don't was pretty upset. I could have done a better job, seriously. Just frustrated.
__label__1	The staff do not care. They are rude. Got two roast beef and cheddars and both were overly salty and cold. There was nothing good about this food or this location.
__label__1	Had a Power washing scheduled for over 3 weeks. Confirmed with them the day before that they would be there.  I took off work to meet them when they were supposed to be there in the morning.  By noon they still weren't there even after a call to the office saying they should be.  Weather is fine so that is not the issue - they are just a no-show with no excuse.  I seriously doubt that the other reviews are legitimate.  It's probably a call center with subs doing the work.  Very frustrated with people who don't do what they say they will!
__label__1	Hotel is great. Quiet on level 2. Large 2 room near the elevator had no sound issues. Only issue i has was with the bar which charged $10 for a draft beer. Also, it was more than $20 for a beer and a shot of Jameson. More than airport prices. Go across the road and get decent costs.
__label__1	This place sucks. This is the worst service I have ever seen in my life. First I order over the phone to pick up the order and then I get there and they say that they actually waited to start making the food when I got there because it was a big order. Then NOT ONE person there was wearing a mask including the manger. Also just look at the drinks. This was their biggest size of margarita they had, it's not even HALF of the Damn cup.
__label__1	I read some of the reviews for this company and called them to assist with a leak in the outside shutoff valve.  Was treated rudely by a male answering the phone.  After being questioned like a criminal, was finally told it would be $199 for someone to come out and walk around looking for a leak...if he had to go into his truck it would be $350.  No thanks for the rudeness and 3rd degree.
__label__1	They tried to charge me for a pup cup for my dog. I was shocked because no other Dairy Queen or even Starrbucks has ever charged for it. so I googled it when I got home and I guess some Dairy Queens can opt to charge their customer for it. I think that's very tacky and a little greedy. Seriously, what does it cost a few cents?? They don't make enough profit off there ice cream Lol I didn't have enough change on me so they took the  pup cup back from my dog.
__label__1	We showed up on Saturday around lunch... got seated and even ordered food... then noticed not just one or two but  gnats covered both the walls as we were in a booth  and we quickly exited
__label__1	just get your bagel to go and leave. costs $.25 extra to toast them. my smoothie with just orange juice, mango, pineapple, raspberry's, and strawberries cost $8.5 and the oj is gross and has barely any flavor. way overpriced for the bad quality and service. they took our food before we were done.
__label__1	I have to say the food was very good, but I was there with a group of fifty.  We had a limited menu to choice from, and coffee and tea was included in our dinner free of charge.  When dinner ended we were not asked if we wanted coffee.  Although the waitress was told we wanted coffee she just disappeared and when I found the manager, a rather rude woman who's name I didn't get tried to double talk her way out of including it with dinner and no one tried to retify the situation.  I will NOT be going back there.
__label__1	"This place is the Wal-Mart of bicycle shops, plenty of product, an array prices, and a staff that knows nothing about bicycles. Unlike any other local bike shop the staff comes and goes with such frequency that you never know what level of bad service you are going to get, just expect it to be bad. 
I was talking to an employee about folding bicycles and he tried to sell me a FELT racing bike. The mechanic had to explain to the employee what a ""folder"" is.
If you know exactly what you are looking for shop here. Otherwise there are better options along Route 30."
__label__1	If you want to relax during a gel mani pedi DON'T come here. They do them at the same time and it's so distracting. They constantly make you move your hands, AND put the UV lamp on my lap and get slipping that I had to move to keep it from falling in the water! I even paid extra for 10 min foot massage that I didn't enjoy at all! Not to mention that got nasty nail dust and my cuticle clippings all over my pants. FYI- they weren't even busy so WTF was the rush!?
__label__1	I really wish I can give them ZERO starts. This place is horrible. The attitudes are horrible, the manager lied. Will never visit the place again
__label__1	This place seems totally dark and sadistic. Masks itself as good but it is far from that. There is certainly power here, but of the wrong spirit. So much manipulation and sorcery. Be very careful with this place. Please, I would highly recommend that people stay away from here. The staff is full of bitterness, competition, and judgement. Very scary place. Very scary.
__label__1	AWFUL JOB I wanted what is shown in the picture my nails DO NOT EVEN LOOK FRENCH I'm so upset she did not even bother to take off the glitter on the nude area they look bulky and my pointer finger IS SO CROOKED I will never go again.
__label__1	"A friend went there to purchase a tire to replace the one that was damage from potholes. He 
Purchase a new tire tire for them to put it on. But when it was done, come to find out they had repaired his damage tire and place it back on his car thinking he would not notice the difference. So he had to go back and get his new tire he purchase. That when they decided to tell him, hey we repaired you old tire and put it back on your car. Very bad business ethics here. Beware."
__label__1	Terrible experience last visit. Took nearly an hour to get our order and it wasn't right or hot. Waitress was great and totally swamped. Kitchen totally mismanaged. Manager/Owner apathetic. Well he did say he was so sorry and gave us a $3.65 discount on a $26 tab. But he didn't intervene w the kitchen and get our order straight. Last 5-6 prior visits were fine. This one was so unpleasant we won't be back. Too bad. We do our best to support local small business, especially in Gentilly.
__label__1	I typically eat at Honeygrow for a quick stir-fry but today I wanted to try the salad. I ordered the salad through Caviar for pick up (to avoid the lines) and I received a bug in my food. I had already eaten half way through the salad when I noticed it. I don't understand how a salad place does not thoroughly wash and examine their produce before serving it to people. Definitely not ordering from here again. Luckily because I ordered with Caviar, I received a full refund and credit for their site. Not a good look.
__label__1	"This places service is an utter joke. Waiting 30+ minutes for a simple to go sandwich ? F+++ and cant comment on food since they don't like to serve it.

You have to be kidding about the service other Yelp reviewer. La Teresita at least serves food."
__label__1	Terrible service.  Group of 5 enter and order at the same time.  Food came out so slowly that based on the intervals the food would come out by the time the first member had finished their meal.  3 times in a row.  Even after multiple check in by said customers.
__label__1	"Thought I would try going here again after a long while. I wish I had held out a lot longer.  Food was brought to me cold. Server came off like she thought of herself as being some ""Rock Star"". I won't go back again."
__label__1	"The paint job on my fill was horrendous. When I asked them to fix a smudge, an employee exasperatedly painted one coat without a top coat and rudely sent me on my way. A nail I had repaired broke off hours after my fill. When I went back to get it fixed, they cut my finger and charged me for the repair and new paint job. 
In all, I spent over $40 for a fill. I will never be back here."
__label__1	Worst service. I called to get my new softener and whole house filtration installed. The technician kept groaning under his breath and my husband finally asked if there was a problem and he said he had never installed one before and it would take him 5-6 hours and would have to come back another day. He also quoted us over $1000. I bought the system on Amazon and it said easy installation and many people said it was easy to install yourself. I should have just gotten amazon to install for $400.
__label__1	The atmosphere was nice and we waited about twenty minutes for a table, not bad at all, had some drinks and relaxed at the bar. The real trouble came when they told us our table was ready and no one came and we waited thirty minutes. No one was ever assigned to our table, we just left. It's their loss ,as we were going to spend about two hundred dollars there on boiled seafood, but I don't think they care
__label__1	"Needed a pair of glasses so I decided to shop this location. I found the glasses I liked however, I ended up purchasing them from the Court location....Reason being the staff were not helpful and pretty much ignored me the entire time I was in the store. The store wasnt even that busy on my visit however, they were more interested in having conversations with each other and there friends who stopped by.

If you need glasses from Lenscrafters in KOP I would suggest you shop the Court location, see my review on that store."
__label__1	"Customer service is awful. I tried to get a store credit of $60 on a jacket that did not fit my 20 year old daughter because it was over 90 days. They would not even give me a store credit . I had the jacket with all tags on and the receipt.
I would never shop there. I waited a long period for my daughter to return home from college to try on jacket. Anyway I will never shop there again when I can purchase easily from Nordstrom and they have excellent service all around."
__label__1	Would give zero stars if possible. I waited on an order for 2.5 hours before calling to find out they canceled my order without ever notifying me. By this time it was too late to order from anywhere else. Management needs to be fired.
__label__1	Went here over the holidays with my family and was very disappointed to see the chef not wearing a mask throughout the evening. Chef touched his nose several times and continued to cook. Completely ruined my experience at Savor and will not be attending again during the pandemic.
__label__1	Terrible management that treats people without respect! Could not believe the way my hubs and I were treated over a seating issue... very sorry we went here. Sad part: we were in our right seats
__label__1	"Made a huge mistake going here. Got there at noon, another mistake. Not slammed, but busy. They were not coping well at all with it. Took about 35 minutes from ordering to getting my food. Got it to go, as lunch time was over for me. 
So the fries were okay, decent. The hamburger was a disaster. It looked like someone took frozen meat and put it right on the grill. Inside cooked okay, outside dry hard and tasteless. I understand they are busy, but quality shouldn't suffer. Stop taking orders for crying out loud."
__label__1	I have NEVER been treated so poorly by a company's customer service team. I reached out for an initial event and received very rude emails and went against my best judgment to contact again. WOW. I was working with Robert both times and after multiple rude emails, I realized that City Food Tours is a company I will never attempt to work with again. Good luck, City Food Tours. If you want to be successful, work on Robert and your Customer Service team.
__label__1	"Did not honor the deal on their own app.  The computers or systems were down or whatever but why should the customer suffer?

They obviously don't care."
__label__1	It is a shame that an employee who purchases a vehicle from their employer does not get the same experience as a customer off the street. The vehicle purchased was low on gas and had not been detailed. I witnessed this transaction and decided to submit my comment to Yelp so anyone considering purchasing a vehicle (new or used), from a company that does not value employees who become customers, will reconsider. They are just as important and word of mouth travels just as fast through them. Every customer deserves the red carpet experience. They deserve a red bow too. I will gladly take my business elsewhere.
__label__1	"Customer service- not good. 

2 girls were working and the shorter girl talked so low no one could hear her so she left it to her other friend which was a Latin female who was an ok worker. She talked but looked like she didn't want to. It's funny because my friend is trying to franchise this place to another location but I called him and made him decide not to! Bad reputation."
__label__1	Went with my wife and daughter.  I got a burger, wife got a patty melt and daughter got a french dip.  Burger tasted and looked like a frozen patty and was so, so.  Daughter said her's was ok and my wife got so sick we thought we was going to have to take her to the hospital.  We will not be going back, which is sad because Pleasant View needs good restaurants outside of junk food stops.
__label__1	Safe to say, after 40 min waiting for my online order and coming home to a hair in my mashed potatoes I won't ever come here again! Sorry not sorry we spent 40/50$ to not be full, food was mediocre and were going to taco bell now anyways.
__label__1	Can't believe you would discontinue gluten free!! Pizza is always great but... So many ppl that have gluten issues.
__label__1	"I don't usually leave reviews, but this place doesn't even serve food. Jail slop would taste better and the ""cook"" is just a lazy slob who doesn't even care about the food that he fries. Crappy portion sizes, mostly just terrible rice, barely any meat, not to mention they even forgot to put meat on my girlfriend's poké bowl. Overpriced for the kind of garbage that they serve."
__label__1	Normally good food and service. Sent my cold eggs and bacon back for hot food this morning and this is what I found under my new hot eggs! Cigarette ashes? Floor dirt?
__label__1	i was just assualted for asking a patron why they werent wearing a mask. they followed me into the elevator and hit and me then called cops on me! i think i have a shattered eardrum and all the cops want to do is question me! this hotel is not safe for patrons and should be avoided at all costs. i have travelled all over the world and have never felt so unsafe in my own country.
__label__1	Cheap bastards. We bought a beer and when we opened the bottle, the glass around the rim shattered. We went in to return the $3 beer and they would absolutely not let us return it or even buy a different beer. Horrible customer service! Don't go there. Businesses like this one are run by scheisters!
__label__1	Burned again! The carry out sucks! This is our 3rd order in a row that is wrong.  How hard is it to follow simple instructions that you repeat to make sure they are understood. We ordered a chicken wrap plain, without any sauce...repeated plain, no sauce...guess what had spicy sauce!  We are done with the frustration.  Never any issues dinning-in.  The servers are wonderful!
__label__1	"Very terrible customer service, went to go stay one night,just got in from ny, checked into the non smoking room and it smelt like smoke, found dried blood on the door. Found a used shirt under the chair, toiled had hair all over it, stains on the blanket. Very dirty. Don't not recommend to any tourist! 
On top of all that. They are holding my money from me. Recommend going to Fairfield inn a few miles away, very clean."
__label__1	Worst Burrito I've ever had. Flavourless. Bland. Underwhelming. Huge disappointment for lunch.
__label__1	We decided to try something new since we had just moved more central from northeast. I did peep Yelp to check out some reviews and figured it was worth a shot. The food was so bland! I ordered the spinach artichoke dip or whatever it was-HORRIBLE. Also we had two kinds of pizza, both sucked. We are big foodies and we didn't even finish half. Maybe I would consider giving this place a second chance, but honestly it isn't worth the money.
__label__1	They are adding ham chunks to every cheese calzone, cheese pizza Etc because Ronnell said that Corporate said they have to---everyone has to eat pigs--so all protected classes of people who do not eat pigs should not come to this location! Your chances of being shot in this parking lot are extremely high anyway...
__label__1	The second charge of 264.00 was disputed but they said it was 264.00 for each test......there only was only one.  This Has been going on since Late March.  The customer service is rude and she never would have had the test if she knew it was going to be 528.00 since she was quoted 264.00.  To say shes disgusted with Banner is an under statement.
__label__1	Terrible. Period. Rude people and the people who do the gas discount can't do proper math. I was ripped off. If you are advertising cheaper gas when you buy a car wash, at least give the discounted price! Never get gas and a car wash here unless you want to pay full price for both!
__label__1	The dispatch person was full of attitude and hung up on us. Maybe if we were drunk or disrespectful, I could see it. This company just wouldn't be bothered by us. Save yourself stress and call someone else.
__label__1	"They consistently get our orders wrong when we get delivery.  Today the wait time for delivery was two hours. We have had wait times without them telling us of over an hour and a half before.

How is it acceptable to have a wait time for Freaky Fast sandwiches of over an hour?"
__label__1	Hotel hell should go to this location. If they didn't have excellent staff they would have nothing. Please take the advice of these reviews and travel farther --- La Quinta in O'Fallon is nice . The floors in the hotel are disgusting . The room we had seemed to have recently been redone and so if we did not venture outside the bedroom it was tolerable but I had a sleepless night worrying about how clean the bed could possibly be ....
__label__1	I was rushed into a sale and they got me into a matress that ended up giving me bed problems and didn't go over any of the return policy . Come to find it 7-10 days later after financing there is a no return policy or money back worst experience ever would not recommend this place
__label__1	Would love to give a better rating but i cannot seem to be able to book an appointment despite Yelp reflecting them as being open... what kind of a business are you running that doesnt even have a voicemail??
__label__1	I stopped by here and ordered a Cuban sandwich for lunch. It was very good. The staff was very friendly too. I would return.
__label__1	Money hungry owner and staff! Beware
__label__1	Very rude employee, dark short hair, I think she had some piercings. My boyfriend and I pulled up to the window and she kept making nasty faces at us through the window. When she finally opened and acknowledged us she had such a horrible attitude, literally almost threw the bad at us and slammed the window and walked away. I don't know if she had a bad day, but we still maintained our manners even with the horrible service and we're very confused as to why she acted the way she did. Subway needs to train their employees better on customer service!
__label__1	NEVER  buy a Christmas tree here. Legit horrible. Our tree is already so dry . We faithfully buy our tree at Home Depot, the trees last so long and smell like Christmas tree. Our tree from this place is dry, and odorless.
__label__1	Beware this location does not want to honor returns/exchanges easy. I guess they don't sell enough merchandise to be able to offer no hassle returns. Reno location has way better customer service.
__label__1	Amazingly horrible service. I was going to use a debit card and they wanted to see my return ticket and two pieces of identification and we're gonna run a credit check. Now I'm in line to get out and there must be 15 cars here and nobody is moving.
__label__1	Just turned around a walked out ... the front desk staff is still as incompetent and rude as ever.  I had called ahead to get pricing for a teen facial and received a call back with a full message stating $65 for one hour, etc.  When we arrived, the unfriendly front desk ladies informed me the Teen facial would be anywhere between $85-$110.  I had to play the message to them on speaker and they STILL would not admit to their mistake and honor the pricing I was given.  Seriously?  NO customer service...
__label__1	They tried the classic move of spending too much time on my back and legs and then asking 'do you want more time?'.  It's so obvious they are milking the massage that it is a disgrace.  I said I wanted an hour, then do the whole thing in an hour.
__label__1	Employees are unnecessarily rude. I had placed my order at the kiosk, paid at the register, and waited over 15 minutes to get the order. They finally called my number, went up to grab my food and was told I needed to pay first. I politely explained that I paid already. The employee screamed across the room to ask the cashier if I paid, she said yes and that I was fine. I didn't even want the food at this point. It was extremely embarrassing, will not be returning.
__label__1	Just still surprised this place still makes it. Never really have great service here and they have very few healthy options.
__label__1	My husband bought my mother in law a $60 gift card a few months ago and she called to schedule an appointment and it turns out they closed indefinitely. I think it was pretty rude to not give the customers a heads up. We are trying to figure out how to get our money back.
__label__1	This organization is greedy. After promising to roll over the 2020 season pass to 2021 because of COVID and lack of open days the manager is refusing to do so. I don't recommend getting a pass here ever. The mountain itself is lame at best. The lines are crowded because they have only 2 main lifts. I'll never ride here again.
__label__1	"Never again. They are a total rip off. Stated my truck took up two spaces when I parked in their drawn lines. Ticketed me b/c my bed of my truck extended out.. Disputed the ticket.. Bottom line they lost out on four days of parking$ and friends parking there as well. Do the math Premier Parking!! 
You lost out big time!"
__label__1	the service was terrible. worst ever. our waiter barely even came to us twice and every time we needed something we tried to ask another waiter but they flat out ignored us and didn't even look. hate this place.
__label__1	Been a loyal customer for decades! 35+ years! Ordered a couple pizza's for work.  Didn't realize they had sold out to DoorDash. What a shame! The store on Fairview has a sign up that says, You don't live in a hut and your pizza shouldn't come from one. Or something like that. At least their pizza is warm and not 1 1/2 hours late! By the way you pizza sucks cold, dried up, and non edible. Called and their response was, sorry but tough. Deal with it. Will be going elsewhere from now on.
__label__1	Very bad service, i was arrive here 8.30for oil change ，the front guy told me wait for about 20-30mins,  after 1hour pass, i go check the front lady, she told me still have 3 cars in front of my car, that means i have to wait for 2 more hrs, i won't be here anymore, i got my car here, that's the reason I keep coming here to do all the car service, this is second time make me disappoint, very Sucks, waste my time!
__label__1	If you want to pay outrageous prices for a childsize portion, then latitudes is for you. They charge $5 extra for salmon bowl and the entire bowl was the size of a very small soup. A small side of fries $4. Get outta town. One waitress for lunch crowd. Nope
__label__1	I like Zinburger but take  an hour for the hamburger and no one comes to check us until we asked them.
__label__1	Terrible experience. It took 45+ minutes to get our food after we ordered. When we got our food, it was lukewarm and one person in my party to return back his taco al carbon because it was just chicken and tortilla. The server didn't even come back and check on us or offer us a refill on our drinks. We won't be coming back.
__label__1	The raspados aren't really good. Seems like they're very stingy with the fruit. My raspado had about 6 strawberries and 3 pieces of piña, the rest was just ice and juice. Strawberries tasted like canned ones.
__label__1	Horrible apartments to. All hone. Management was always rude to tenants! I never had an encounter but I have witnessed other tenants treated badly. When I moved in, I was told that I had brand new carpet and I didn't. Apparently the tenants before me had a dog that urinated all over the carpet but somehow I was charged a new carpet fee upon moving out. I would definitely not recommend this place!
__label__1	"Not good. This is a downtown restaurant! (I know, what's that got to do with it, downtown rent) 
I had a tostada salad my guest had tacos with rice and beans. Flavorless! Not seasoned, bland and ordinary at best. 
Bathroom should have scared me away but we had already ordered. I see it as a lack of respect for people that work and or live downtown. 
I wanted this to be good but this is a place to skip."
__label__1	I wish I could give them zero stars. Made a reservation for an airport ride for 4:30 in the morning on Saturday. Called a day before to confirm. Saturday at 4:30 they didn't show up. Called dispatch, told me they were looking for an available vehicle for me. Bottom line is, not a taxi service. Independent drivers like Uber. If you need reliability stay away from them.
__label__1	Very poor service, slow and in accurate on orders. And seemed very complacent about the poor service and appearance. Kitchen floor was dirty. All together a bit sorry.
__label__1	So they HAD the sound on during the hockey game....until some guy decided to play the jukebox.  I asked the bartender to turn it back and they refused. I thought this was a SPORTS bar?!?  And the steak sandwich was chewy. It's less than 2 miles from my house, it's sad but I'm Never going back.
__label__1	This location has gotten awful.   You are pretty much guaranteed to have your order completely screwed up and then the help with argue with you that you were in the one that got it wrong.    I would have done better at McDonald's next door - cheaper, better and my order would have been correct.
__label__1	I just went to best nails! They suck! I got a pedicure and the lady cut my nails to short then she broke my big toe nail like chipped it! After all that she went to massage my legs and didn't use lotion and only did it for about 3 mins. It was horrible! Do not ever go here ! They rush everything! It's horrible!!
__label__1	"Ordered Mac n cheese for Delivery, there was no description, just ""Mac n cheese"", it had bacon all mixed into it, the coleslaw was dry and not flavorful. The hot cauliflower was ok, not worth going there for.
We just wanted Mac n Cheese, like it said in the menu on DoorDash. They need to better describe their food.
It will probably go to the garbage, or a homeless person at best."
__label__1	My brother and I waited 3 hours to get covid testing and were told that it would only be 30 minutes to an hour. Do not go here if you need to know test results right away. They took awhile to get to us in the room as well. It's ridiculous. Go somewhere else where they aren't rude and dismissive.
__label__1	Domino's owes me money for food not received. It's been 5 weeks and still nothing. I spoke with several people who said they'd handle and still nothing. They are thieving liars, IMO! What's the problem?!
__label__1	Horrible food. Got General Tso chicken and it was hard. Half of the pieces were not edible. Terrible customer service. I asked for a soda instead of an egg roll and was told that was not what I asked for when I called my order in so I could not switch them out. Don't recommend this place and never going back.
__label__1	Bowling worked for my kid's birthday but the service flat out sucks. We ordered food and it never arrived. A half hour later I talked to the manager who failed to assuage my faith in the place. When my sister in law's order finally showed up 50 mins later it was a meager improved. Go to another place that can serve their customers needs on a Saturday. Stay Away, while in Tucson!
__label__1	"Very rude customer  service when u press 0 to talk to a staff member. 
Called on July 31, 2021 at 10 am . Young lady is obnoxious.  Won't be dealing with this location anymore."
__label__1	The service was great but everyone I went with got sick after eating here. The broth for the pho we got tasted awful!!
__label__1	Terrible.  The parking lot is not designed well.  They were out of French bread!  Kind of the whole point of the experience.  Then, we couldn't get out of the drive thru line because of how terrible the parking lot is and we couldn't turn around.  Awful.  Will not recommend.  Such a shame.
__label__1	Management is horrible. Was upset that I asked to turn down music for national championship college football game. They in return said I was not able to be served. DONT GO HERE.
__label__1	This is a nightmare.  Almost an entire month to receive my order.   Too big -- returned.  Tracked package.  Their own website showed it received.  Their rep said no.  Advised me I have to wait 30 consecutive days... MORE THAN A MONTH TO WAIT FOR MY CREDIT CARD TO BE REFUNDED WITH RETURN!  Never again.  Miserable experience, crappy customer service, not worth the headache.
__label__1	I was very disappointed! I'd like to think I am not overly fussy about a hair cut. I can usually work with anything. Ughhh this was not my experience here. She was heavy with the scissors to say the least. I specifically stated I was attending a wedding and wanted just a trim to shape things up a little. I walked out with tears in my eyes and very little hair left on my head. It wasn't just short but the cut itself was terrible, uneven and shapeless. I will not go back! I guess you get what you pay for. My bad!
__label__1	Horrible service. Waited an hour for a table because the text that the table was ready never came as they inputted the wrong number. So, after another lengthy wait, we ordered a simple egg meal and it took another 45 minutes and was cold. Very disappointed.
__label__1	"Do NOT but the furniture here - terribly slow to get your order. Once they take your money , they are in NO hurry to deliver your order . How can it take over eight weeks to construct a few pieces of wood ?
You will regret doing business with these people"
__label__1	Wow, what happened? This place used to be the best. The beef with oyster sauce I got to go today was terrible. The sauce was watery and the predominant flavor was yellow mustard. Disappointed. New cook?
__label__1	The waitress Bobbie at the bar gave me the first time experience in life to be refused to serve. I came to the place for enjoying after work life, not someone have bad attitude and don't know what customer service is. The manager is nice and tried to help solve the issue and by the time manager talked to me, Bobbie argued rudely in the back and tried to get her coworker to support her rudeness point. I was a waitress before and know what customer service should be. A tight labor market doesn't mean you can treat customer with your own interpretation and attitude.
__label__1	I was in this Meijer again just earlier today and was frustrated yet again by how many--by count just over half--employees from greeters to shelf stockers to check out clerks, all of whom had face masks, were wearing their masks pulled down around their neck or, if they had them up at all had the top of the mask beneath their nose. I mean, come on, why even pretend?
__label__1	"This was our first and LAST visit to Ryuu.  The server couldn't get the order correct and we had to remind her to get our beer.  The chef burnt the shrimp and vegetables.  

I ordered a vegetable dinner and it was very small so my husband gave me his vegetables also.  The food was also very oily."
__label__1	Worst pizza ever.Like other posts on here,depends on who makes your pizza,last time I ordered a pizza it was burnt and the cheese was spotty,not evenly spread.Was told when I complained about the pizza being burnt that some people like it that way,well not me.Do yourself a favor and try Champs at Woodhaven mall,much better.If you must order from pizza sh#### do not order on sundays,they have a bunch of young people working that do not have a clue on how to make a good pizza or anything else.
__label__1	Ordered on grub hub walked in to get my food. I stood in front of the cashier for a good 2 minutes until she looked up and noticed me. Portions are small and the spring rolls are way to much for the size you get. Don't recommend this place at all.
__label__1	For the price you pay, the portions are tiny! Food is ok, not the best. Defiantly not worth the money. If you want good Chinese food go to rays wok in spruce grove!
__label__1	ordered books in-store and paid for expedite shipping, two associates promised that i would have the books on time. and when it did not come in i called store Manager John, who did not care and didn't want to check the status of my order. I eventually spoke to another person who told me that they have the books in stock and John could have offered me instore pick up but he didnt bother to offer any help in regards to my order.
__label__1	Unfortunately another one star  review for a chain restaurant.  Appetizer was not served before the meal.  Had to ask for it after the meal was served.  Meal was served a second behind the salad.  The young lady serving us very nice.  I don't know how much of the disjointed timing of our meal was on her performance..  The last few experiences with the national chains has reinforced that I need to stay with local restaurants to receive good service and food for my restaurant dollars.
__label__1	"There are a few places which you should avoid by looking at Yelp ratings below 3.
This is one such place.

Very rude and unprofessional staff.
Took our order after 25 mins and then let us know after half an hour that its gonna take 40 mins more.

Mango lassi here has a chemical formulae of h2o

Avoid Avoid Avoid
And this comes from an Indian."
__label__1	"It was bland, forgettable and over priced. Bacon and Canadian bacon are two different meats, and don't advertise basil leaves unless you actually put an ample amount on worth an entire $1.50. 
Teenagers working at Pizza Hut are more capable."
__label__1	Oh dear. Don't go here . There is a strong sewage smell . The crabs where old and clearly warmed up . Bugs in 3 drinks that had to be sent back . Food just not good at all . I heard the ownership just switched hands because the father passed away . Really sad . Whoever took it over is running it in the ground . Wish i had seen the review about the health code violations before we went here . Terrible . The picture is of a bug , who has clearly passed out on the table behind us . Why is there pet fresh carpet freshener on the table also ?
__label__1	ok, wtf is going on with ths place?  this place used to serve best meat in town...and now it has gone crap...my friend and i came for dinner last night...price went up...meat was very chewy...marinated meat was quiet not there...we just ordered two orders and closed our tab...then went to nalmada...aka every day good house...
__label__1	This company is not reputable. I called for an estimate and he asked me to give my full credit card number over the phone. I asked if the had a website where I could pay the deposit and he said no. That I should give him the first 8 numbers of my credit card over the phone and email him the rest and that when the movers come, I should pay them in cash. So many red flags. Hire a reputable mover. Don't ever give you full credit card number over the phone.
__label__1	Sitting in the restaurant waiting for wait staff it's been 15 mins since we sat and no one wants to make eye contact with us. It's 7:42 on a Friday night and there are 5 tables open and the rest are full, staff is running around. Now it's been 10 mins more and we're leaving. Good luck to this place. Food good or not, it's rude to not even acknowledge someone.
__label__1	Apparently I can't give 0 stars so I had to give a 1 star. Poor customer service. I enrolled into their monthly program but when I cancelled it all my sessions were also cancelled. They still charged me for 2 months. So I paid for 2 months and did not have any massage sessions.
__label__1	Refused service because it was 2:47 and said that it was to close to 3:00 the lady does not wear a name tag and acted very unprofessional when I tried to show her the time was very offended being that I come in all the time after work and the new employee did not know the procedures for selling alcohol real shame that you'd choose loss of service rather than figuring out how to handle the situation properly really need to get nick back to this location, was very refreshing having a friendly like minded professional.
__label__1	Seriously. Why the 5 stars? I guess I'd you want the choice between one style (a circle with STL in the middle) then this is the place for you. Oh yeah. You will want to wait in line for 45 minutes to pay too.
__label__1	Went in for a routine oil change with a specific appointment time- ended up still waiting four hours for the car to be serviced. When the oil change was done they didn't even put a sticker telling me when the next one was due. Don't bother making an appointment or coming here at all.
__label__1	Stop giving out my phone number! I have gotten over 20 phone calls the last few weeks asking if I am Kim's Nails! Please carefully review whatever advertising or marketing you are putting out, because it has the wrong number on it.
__label__1	This place was a joke we ordered our food after a wait of about 10 min the restaurant was not busy then 30 min later the food came , then about 8 min later our drinks finally arrived but not our shakes after 10 more min I ask for the bill because we still did not get our shakes , ask to talk to the manager Ann because my bill came with the shakes still on it, then she acted like she was doing us a favor by taking off our shakes off the bill . Very bad management and service
__label__1	The wine is fine, but the service is terrible. Walked in near the end of their hours (which they close at 5 for some reason), and they told us that we couldn't be served. We had a list of wines we wanted, but they weren't helpful at all. 1 star for decent wine, but won't be back.
__label__1	I don't know what they did to the food but it turned out super duper salty. I literally had to throw out the whole thing. Def would not come back again.
__label__1	"Do not go here unless you want to be pushed all sorts of added services. Plus, they lie! 

I went in for an oil change. The attendant came by to show me ""discoloration"" of my transmission fluid. But, I had had my transmission fluid serviced less than 4,000 miles earlier.

I told this to the attendant, and he still persisted. I told him he and Oil Stop could not be trusted, and I would never return. By the way, I had the transmission fluid checked by another auto repair shop, and it confirmed there was nothing wrong with it.

Oil Stop is bad news!"
__label__1	First the good, very friendly & attentive server with a cool atmosphere.   Now the bad...started with an Old Fashioned cocktail.   Bartender suggested Jefferson's Ocean.   I've had Jefferson's in the past and really like it, but didn't realize the Ocean small batch was so expensive.  Cocktail was made w small ice cubes & cost $36!    Dinner was ok.   Salad was salty and my trout was ok but bland.   My wife got the meatballs, which tasted like they were made from MRE meat, which I know too well as a veteran.    Overall not recommended
__label__1	My daughter had problems with the contacts she was given and the receptionist is very rude and treated her as if she was a child while Dr Kenny sat in the room right next to the receptionist  and listened to what was being said and did nothing.  She lost four patients that day. I took my family elsewhere and my daughter was given contacts for a astigmatism on the first visit with a new doctor and has not had a problem with them fitting again. I would not go to this doctor.
__label__1	Worst store!! I have bad yogurt I got there just last week. It was expired before I bought it. The produce sucks and they are always out of things. I always hear people complain when I'm there.
__label__1	"The pot stickers were burned.  The ""saute shrimp"" was not sauted in anything, just boiled shrimp.  the noodles (the star of this company) were bland and well not that good."
__label__1	The hostess Mo was rude with us, it was a bad smell by our table and we wanted to change the table, we sat down by another table but she said that she couldn't host us. We like Ihop but definitely don't suggest you to go to this location.
__label__1	I was just in this store and the floor is absolutely disgusting! I've seriously never seen a floor in a grocery store that needed to be cleaned so badly.
__label__1	If your starving then you can order from here. But unless you starve don't eat here. I like the inside and it looks nice which is why there is a 2 stars but I got food poison 2 times so I am done with this place. It sucks so much
__label__1	Absolutely terrible. The server was very nice but she obviously new and never served a day in her life. She messed up my food, and blamed me which in the service world is something you should not do. She then made us pay for a 2nd one (again her mistake) and then we were over charged for something we did not get. It is off season so maybe they're summer staff is better but the food was not very good. I would not recommend this place.
__label__1	Disappointed! We brought our kids for a mini vacation and on the first night around 9:30pm the fire alarm sounded, we gathered our 3 young children and scurried down the steps and out the emergency exit. After standing in the freezing cold for quite some time my husband decided to enter the lobby only to find the alarm was over and everyone was just going about their business never acknowledging the people standing outside waiting. We had to ask if it was a false alarm and if we could return to our room..
__label__1	I never give bad reviews but this Toppers pizza  is the ABSOLUTELY the worst. RUDE, RUDE and IGNORANT. After an HOUR waiting for delivery and talking to 2 managers they found my pizza still sitting on the hot rack in the store. Oh it will be another 30 mins to have it delivered. Read the previous reviews and stay far away from this place. I will be following up to Toppers headquarters.  Customer service is by FAR the worst I have ever encountered.
__label__1	That looks like a scam so far. I've ordered a Christmas present in early December and still didn't get it. Customer support is nonexistent. Have to engage PayPal protection first time in my life. DO NOT BUY.
__label__1	Based on the reviews I really thought I found a gem here.  What a disappointment.   They wouldn't seat me because I was a party of 1.   They told me I had to sit at the bar and it was currently full so I would just have to wait.  In the meantime 2 small tables were sitting empty.   Go elsewhere these people don't want your business.
__label__1	Poor food. Worst I have had yet in America. Not going back to this joint or any other of the chain anytime soon.
__label__1	My truck was having difficulty starting and I eventually bought a new battery from from here.  Within 24 hours my truck was dead again and would  not start.  I assumed it was a different problem as I had put a new battery.  Long story short, I was left without use of my vehicle for an extended period of time and incurred additional expense because they sold me a garbage battery and won't stand behind their product.
__label__1	"It was the consensus amongst the 10 people in our party that this was by far the worst Mexican food they had ever been served. It was also disappointing to learn, and after the fact, that the margaritas we had ordered were ""wine based"", containing no tequila. We felt like we had been duped."
__label__1	Multiple times I have had poor results from this business: shirts coming back with new stains that hadn't been there before, the inability to remove simple discolorations, and so on. The employees are basically nice enough, but after giving them so many chances (due to its very convenient location for me), I will be trying out something more distant in the hopes that I won't have to make return trips.
__label__1	Had such a bad experience here at temple university chipotle...such bad customer service and they give too little food in my chipotle bowl. Big disappointment and will never go back to that place ever again.
__label__1	"after we ordered locally (to support local businesses vs internet ordering), and Spark's Florist sending us a picture of the to be delivered flowers, (with us asking for the flowers to be left at my mom's door for her birthday Saturday), they still are not delivered today (Sunday night) and I'm sure will look very sad tomorrow. 

Will never use Sparks Florist again.

Owner Mike, don't leave a sad excuse on yelp. 

You have lost a customer forever. This was her 90th. 

Flowers matter, and you are in the wrong business."
__label__1	"Way over priced. 

I also got charged $200 just for them find out why my engine light was on. Not to fix it, just to check it. I went and did this before at Meinke and it was free. It ended up being the oxygen sensor. For a new one, them to ""check"" it and state inspection my bill ended up being over $600 total!?!? YIKES! Their oil changes are over $40. Meinke is $20. I'm done with them."
__label__1	Poor service , ordered roast beef po-boy very dry and then charged $2.00 for gravy.  Avoid if you want to have good local food.
__label__1	Worst experience and worst food. The management is rude as hell. We asked for a replacement as food was not cooked properly and they started arguing why we did not like it and behaved very rudely with us. I will give a negative rating if there's an option. No one deserves a treatment like this especially for the money we pay.
__label__1	Awful service. Hostess was incredibly rude. We used to love it now it's horrible. Do not go!!
__label__1	"How many here know what chow mein is? The lady I spoke to on the phone tried to convince me that a container full of chopped up celery and onions, with a tiny bag of fries wonton skins on the side is chow mein. Yelled at me that what she gave me is accurate. Tasted disgusting just like the rest of what we ordered. If you like bad ""Chinese"" food and getting yelled at, this is the place for you."
__label__1	86 this place!!! Fake German restaurant how do you claim your a German restaurant when you serve no German beer??? Service horrible ordered goulash thought it was a meal was served a thimble full waiter said they 86'd the goulash at 7pm Called waiter a jackass said I feel like leaving he picked up our meals and made us pay for our drinks was mad because we called a different waitress over after he  ignored us.  Don't bother plenty of better restaurants nearby that are way better
__label__1	This place used to be really upfront and very knowledgeable about doing proper repairs. I took my car up there, paid over 700 on repairs, just to barely get it home less than 2 miles away. If the car cannot be fixed you need to let customers know and not act like it is, just for it to still not be running. I also had a friend who I sent up there to have repairs done and they did not do half of the work on his vehicle that they charged him for. Don't go to this shop!
__label__1	"Well if you have the privilege of knowing the people that are working in there or own the place, you will get service otherwise forget it. My husband and I were totally ignored while we were in there for lunch. 
Food might  be good but we will never know."
__label__1	"This lady with the dark eye liner all around her eyes made this ""fiesta"" salad. It's missing a bunch of stuff!"
__label__1	Stopped by with some friends to have brunch/lunch and chat.  What we got was a desrespectful hostess who evidentally is allowed to scream at another employee.  No matter what was going on, no need to yell in front of customers and for that reason we will not return.  Just ruined our meal and left a bad taste in our mouth.
__label__1	Ugh! This is not Italian food. The restaurant was dirty and food was too sparky and over cooked.
__label__1	"Vomiting and diarrhea from 4am Sunday til 7pm thanks to Vinny's Marco Polo pizza.  Will never order from Vinny's again. Whole day lost to being sick. Thanks Vinny! 

Nice customer service response from Vinny's. I didn't toss your shitty pizza around. Your delivery person did."
__label__1	"I showed up during working hours they put cones in the road abs closed early so they could get out early. 

If you wanna shut down earlier post different hours. One star for bad customer service and posting times that don't reflect working hours. 

Was hoping for a redemption of the soggy fries I got last time, but my experience just keeps getting more negative."
__label__1	Very dissatisfied. Menu description of chicken francais did not include mushrooms. The picatta did and so did the marsala (of course) but not mentioned in  this description. In addition the sauce was bland and the chicken  was far from tender. It was sent back but I was charged for soup and salad. Piss poor at best.
__label__1	Stopped by this place for a quick lunch and ordered a caramelized burger   which comes with fries and a chicken noodle soup that I wanted to take home and told the waitress that. She told me to remind me her. I never get the opportunity to remind the unattentive waitress and she brings my soup out. Then after that debacle I look forward to my burger and the order is 100% wrong. I wanted a caramelized burger cooked medium. They give me a plain hamburger well done. Save the trip and don't eat here.
__label__1	Twice now the maintenance male receptionist has been rude to me, told me he couldn't get me in, and that all Subaru's were backed up. Called Subaru in my town and got an appointment sooner and they ensured they saw my car.  They used to have great customer service but looks like I'll go to the other Subaru, pay a little more, but at least not he talked to appropriately. Not to mention not buying my next Subaru here.
__label__1	Terrible. Food cold and tasted funny. Really gone down hill. Manager has attitude. Awful.
__label__1	Dirty Dirty Dirty! Floors sticky! Food just ok slow very slow service! Tried it twice but it's a no go from now on!
__label__1	Closed.  Went by this place on 49th Street and there is a lease sign up.
__label__1	Switched to Hunt and sons propane to get better service and pricing. Suburban has has been asked multiple times to remove their tank and they respond that they will take care of it, but haven't yet. They continue to try and charge a rental fee fir the tank that they were supposed to remove. With a call they reverse the fee and say they will be out to remove the tank and then don't follow through. I'm so much happier with Hunt and sons; they know how to take care of their customers.
__label__1	"Took My son to Dave & Buster's in Indianapolis to be angry and disappointed on how people and the establishment don't care about following the rules and the mask mandate in Marion County. Maybe the Marion County Health Department should take a look. No accountability from the employees and management was just rude. Never coming back! 
About 50% of the people had no mask whatsoever... the other 25% was under their chin! Just disappointing!"
__label__1	"Reminds me of the Seinfeld episode- ""you know how to take the reservation but not how to keep the reservation"".  Preferred and no car assigned. Standing in a long line waiting for a car. They've tried to give standard car reservations trucks and vans. Poor way to do business. More than half of the names on the board do not have a car assigned. Tuesday AM so not like a Monday rush."
__label__1	Restaurant switched to non halal meat and didn't tell anyone. They Just sold the meat to people who were clearly Muslims without saying anything.
__label__1	They have two atms and they are both broken. You cannot find atms in nashville that allow for the smart deposit and this one has two that do not work.
__label__1	We were visiting in the STL area a few weeks ago.Their galleria does not have Nordstrom's or Neiman's as anchor stores so we had to drive out of the city a bit to find. Once we were there,we expected bar none customer service,if I could rate it no stars that is how bad the service was and we walked directly through customer service and not one person said hello throughout our entire visit.The associate in Glassware was extremely friendly after we shared we were there to purchase a wedding gift and dropped a considerable amount of money-never visit this location again!!
__label__1	My expectations are pretty low for any fast food place, but no ice guys?  Really?  You're out of it????
__label__1	Very bad customer  service. They booked me a time to come in  and then called back to cancel because they wouldn't see someone without a consult  first but apparently they take walk ins. I work in the customer service industry and I would never recommend this studio  after what I've read and how I've been treated as a new  client.
__label__1	"Summit Engineering
This is the 2nd time now that we have run out of water at our office. The service rep does not answer his phone. I have called him twice, and left him a message and I have yet to have a call back from him. I have been on the phone for more than half an hour trying to speak with someone at the office in Reno, and have had no luck. I would say bad customer service."
__label__1	Staff very friendly, food solid, coffee horrible.  Would come back, cup of tea or water next time.   If only Hmart opened earlier.
__label__1	Palace Grill was everything I hoped it would not be. Was hoping it would be an understated representation of NOLAS best, however unfortunately it was more an overstated version of everything we are glad NOLA is not.  Santa Barbara is a cool place on its own..don't overplay it as these restaurant owners do...sorry guys!
__label__1	I also purchased the Groupon and have called at least 10 times and left a message with no return phone call.  I'll be getting a refund as well!  Online scheduling options not available for gel manicure/Groupon.
__label__1	We got an estimate, and they were $20K more than the nearest competitor.  When we told them no thank you (multiple times because they called multiple times a day), they were rude and ignorant to both my husband and me.  Then, they sent reps to our house to discuss our decision- uninvited.  We will never do business with them, and we warn people of the danger of even giving them your contact information.  They are by far the least professional contractor I've ever dealt with- stay away!
__label__1	Never buy a vehicle from here.  We have bumper to bumper extended warranty yet still need to out money out of our pocket to get our car fixed.  On top of that they told us our car would be done in 15-20 mins at 3:45 and my boyfriend is still over there waiting for our car at 7:05.  They told him another half hour.  Obviously they have no idea what they are doing on top of that they keep bull shitting him with different stories.  Save yourself the headache and DO NOT PURCHASE A VEHICLE FROM THEM!!!!
__label__1	"Not a pleasant experience. Server was busy taking care of other tables. Had two baskets of chips before she came to take our order. Food finally came but everything was just warm. Even the cheese didn't melt. 
Must be an off night."
__label__1	"Horrible excuse for Latin food. The service is horrible and the black bean soup is watery and has no flavor. 
The person who brought us out food didn't even know what plate was what. 
The tortilla soup is supposed to have avocado and cilantro which it had none of. 
The waiter never came out to ask us how things were, he has rude and snatched our menus before we were even finished. 
Horrible! I'll never go back."
__label__1	My wife and I have gone here twice now for cake.  You can get a nice moist fresh cake at the supermarket, but you can't get one at this bakery!  We won't be wasting our time nor money on old, dry, and well overprice cake.  If we could give this place a zero or negative we would.
__label__1	Dissapointed. What kind of steakhouses doesn't serve baked potato? What was supposed to be a medium rare steak came out medium well. The manager offered to get me another one after my companion and I finished dinner. Not helpful. Yes she did come my meal, but she could have come over earlier since I had complained to wait staff. With no baked potato, I doubt I will return to Applebee's ever again
__label__1	Came in to eat with the kids and they refused to serve us becaus we brought the kids with us. Said they wouldnt serve us with the kids because they thought we had the intention of leaving the kids in the restaurant and going to gamble. NOT family friendly and low rent establishment!! DO NOT PATRONIZE THIS ESTABLISHMENT! Only gave it one star because I had to to be able to leave review!!!!
__label__1	Not impressed. More than half the tables were free when we walked in. We sat for 15 minutes and not a single server came by. We left. St. Charles has more to offer than this place.
__label__1	If I could have given a minus star I would have! This place is so gross! From the horrible driveway full of massive potholes to the rank incense smell permeating the building! I've been to many Peddlers and Vendors malls but never any this disgusting! Half the booths are empty the others filled with random crap probably from dumpster dives! Heed my advice for pickers and people who enjoy treasure hunts...DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME! And if you do dare to venture in, don't forget your hand sanitizer!!
__label__1	Worst cvs ever. Pharmacy never answers phone. Ever. Front desk didn't care. People are rude and very not helpful. Highly recommend going to another drug store. Any drug store.
__label__1	I haven't actually stayed in the room long but it is absolutely awful and the pictures on their site are deceiving. They say they have queen size beds yet they are only full size. We booked one room with 2 beds for 4 people and now 2 of us will have to sleep on the floor since the beds are so small. Worst hotel I've stayed at. Money would have been better spent elsewhere.
__label__1	Don't waste you time. This place said they have Chicago style pizza and they don't. Being from Chicago I like to check out places that say they are Chicago style when traveling to see how authentic to Chicago that they really are. This place is not it gives Chicago pizza a bad rap. Putting a couple of pictures of the Chicago skyline on your walls is not considered authentic Chicago. Also this place was dirty and dingy. The pop station was self serve and they were out of everything besides regular Coke, I mentioned to the kid working there and he looked at me like I had two heads.
__label__1	Called there once, the person who attended the phone told me to go fuck my self and didn't even let me talk. I don't know if this was just an employee with a bad day but if you asked me I would never go to this store
__label__1	My lunch of bison burger was very disappointing. It was served cold, and I asked for it to be reheated. This was done but took a very long time by which time my friends had finished eating. This time it was warm and anyway the burger was very small, certainly not worth $11.95. I will never return. Beer was OK but pricey.
__label__1	Ordered 3 pizzas on their website and when I go to pick them up it costs $6 more. And they tell me it's not their fault the website is wrong and they won't honor the prices confirmed on my order. Good business practices. Regardless of how the pizza tastes this b/s experience left a foul taste in my mouth.
__label__1	"Easily the worst pizza I have ever gotten. Inedible. I ordered delivery, took one bite, and spit it out. It was a chicken with chipotle sauce. It had this gross, runny sauce all over it, and very little chicken. it was gross tasting and chewy. I was thrilled when they had whole wheat crust. Not thrilled when I tasted it.

This pizza was expensive, and I threw it in the trash."
__label__1	"The bouncer grabbed me and touched me on the way in. I wasn't aware that there was a door check - no need to touch me - could have just said I need to see ID. mentioned it to the bartender - who got extremely salty when I insulted the bouncer AKA his  ""very good friend""- this was also after we tipped very well all night. Bathroom was quite disgusting as well. Never again."
__label__1	While the service was decent, the food was absolutely horrible. The tacos were cold, they ran out of guacamole, and they even forgot to put cilantro and onions on my taco (I was basically served a tortilla and chorizo since they ran out of guacamole). I would not recommend this establishment, as Bakersfield is 10x better and down the street.
__label__1	"EVERY trip I have made on USAir has been late or cancelled all together.  They offer nothing for your troubles and they don't seem to give a damn about the inconvience.  I am sitting at the airport as I type this just having my latest flight cancelled and hoping to get onto a flight that will take me 2hrs away from where my car actually is.  My only other choice is to wait until tomorrow evening.  So its a toss up as to what will cost me more.  This was my last straw.  I will pay the extra to fly another airline!

Think twice."
__label__1	HORRIBLE!!!!  Called customer service because I paid for service and they gave my phone number to someone else that same day. Perla in customer service was not helpful at all. Kept saying that she understood and that Verizon was the one I needed to call. My service is straight talk! My phone was working this morning after I paid for service. Was told that I would have to wait until tomorrow to talk to someone about my service being turned back on. Does not matter that I have to go without my phone that I paid for
__label__1	A violation of hippa is no laughing matter, staff retaliated and revealed reason for visit, choose wisely
__label__1	Ernie who works there is soooo nasty an miserable. Doesn't seem like he wants to be there.  Will not recommend this fast signs to ANYONE ever!!!!!  Got to another location and deal with someone who actually likes their job, and doesn't act like you are a bother to them.
__label__1	Alright, so this place blows for sure. Machine ate $20 and took over 45 minutes to prove it to management that it was their fault and not ours. We understand $20 isn't that much but it goes a long way for our demographic (recent graduates). They refused to admit the mistake even though it isn't that significant.
__label__1	"WORSE McDonald EVER. Rude employees except the security, I don't think the cashier knows what she was doing, she couldn't even get my change right. Our hash browns weren't cooked it was still frozen. The chicken nuggets were not cooked through. The inside of the restaurant smells like crap.
I will not recommend this place to anyone, too bad yelp will not allow me to put a ZERO star."
__label__1	I hate to do this since my remake burrito was so good.  I arrived and look in the bin for my name. Not there. So I was waiting with a few other people and they would continuously put bags in on the letter shelves without even the courteousness of calling out a customers name!!! So we all had to take turns looking at the bags for our names. After waiting 5 minutes I asked for my burrito and someone else had walked out with it!
__label__1	"I was traveling and I really wanted some good sushi after a whole week of a work trip. This place has really good reviews on yelp so I decided to check it out. Boy was I disappointed. The avocado had brown spots and the rice was way too mushy. The overall quality of the fish was not great. 

The only good thing I can say about this place is that is cheap and thank goodness it didn't give me food poisoning the day after. 

I would not go here again"
__label__1	"I have to agree with others' reviews. The pharmacist was very rude when asked a simple question, then the manager actually said, ""doctors say you can get that over the counter here but most doctors have never even been to a Walgreens."" I was appalled at how unprofessional they were. I found the supplement I was looking for at Walmart instead--and that's saying something."
__label__1	I ate there before the shut down.  Got violently ill.  Called and talked with Steve , the owner.  He was of no help. He passed me on to the manager , Michael.   He was of no help either.   I will never return there.  They are not concerned about their customers health and safety .  M
__label__1	This club was awful my friend tried to get a water and they took 50$ from her and she got kicked out. Actually we got kicked out, so unprofessional and the worst experience I've ever had in Tampa...by far. If you're going to go anywhere this place is so unclassy and etc. they must be taking in a lot of illegal money. LMAO just kidding they took her credit card
__label__1	Doctor not the greatest- exhibits zero warmth or empathy. Also very obviously has not read peer reviewed journal articles in past decade. Provided inaccurate medical info on several occasions. Will not return, and don't recommend.
__label__1	Went to this place to get a few drinks. They charge you $4 extra per drink and you have to get in line at the bar to get the money back. Ridiculous.
__label__1	I love the Provence in Hillsboro village but this location was very disappointing. I tried to order a wheat turkey and Swiss panini but instead got charged for another sandwich about $3 more expensive. The cashier seemed really annoyed to fix the problem and I ended receiving a sourdough ham and Swiss panini.......... Service was not great and food was average. Will not be eating here again.
__label__1	This place is horrible. The people at the front desk are rude and not compassionate at all. They lack simple customer service skills and don't know how to talk to people. I'm sure they don't treat the animals nice because they don't treat other people nice.
__label__1	"We've been here 35+ minutes.  Beer came out fairly quick.  That's when it started...  It took 25 minutes just to get my son's drink.  It took 20 minutes just to take our appetizer order.  Still haven't taken our entree orders.  Still haven't gotten our appetizer.  At this point, all we will get from here is absolutely nothing but starvation.  Glad it's close to Burger King.
Update: at the 45 minute mark, our appetizers came out cold."
__label__1	"Hadn't been there much since raja is gone. He was the stalker manager. A real pain. Tonight I went and was served french onion soup instead of toasted big croton or french bread. It was packed with raisin cinnamon bread not even toasted was as warm as my dogs pee.
I get my turkey dinner over dressing lol cinnamon raisin bread. This place sucks. Not like there aren't enough diners around stay away."
__label__1	It's like they've just given up... adding more so it's an actually review so here goes! This S. Reno branch, like most of their locations is a model of inefficiency.  The people in the line all have the same look on their face, none of us want to be at the bank anyways and we get to stand in the line where one teller is working. Get a clue GNCU.
__label__1	I have to pay a damn convenience fee to buy tickets! You guys need to change that. Oh and automatically charging 18% gratuity when I order only popcorn from the bar...It's extremely annoying.
__label__1	Keep your political opinions to yourself & don't send me an email about Trumps executive actions. FYI I voted Trump, so you just lost my business with this. Shame.
__label__1	I don't understand how u can have an animal looking like that and not address it. He couldn't even keep his mouth close because he was so dehydrated. With no water in site.
__label__1	This is the second time that I ordered thru Door Dash and was delivered the wrong pizza.  The ticket taped to the box is my order, but the pizza in the box is someone else's.  When you pay the upcharge for delivery for a $20 fast food pizza, the staff could at least keep the orders straight.  The first time is a mistake, the second is a trend.  Don't try delivery from this location if you want to get what you actually ordered.
__label__1	"I found this place to be a total disaster!! First of all, the hostess was rude when she found out she had to sit a party of 7.  Then to top it off,  they sat us at a table that had trash underneath the table,  and got mad when we asked them to move our seats.   We sit down at another table and it's sticky!! At this point, I know they are not COVID compliant so we leave.   Do not eat here, the customer service is horrendous and they are not clean!!!

Angry Ex-Customer"
__label__1	Horrible customer Service! Do not use them the only thing you should exterminate is this company!
__label__1	"I was very disappointed in my overall experience in this Starbucks. The parking lot was very hectic and the line was super long. After I had ordered my drink I waited for around 5 minutes to get my drink. Then when the barista was handing me my drink he threw the straw at me as I was trying to put my wallet away. When I didn't catch the straw because I was trying to put away my wallet the barista laughed and said ""nice catch"". I hope that the next time I visit this Starbucks I have a much better experience."
__label__1	I will avoid this store like the plague. Wife had lunch there 11/19/18 and was short changed. They deny it but we know 100% that she gave them a $50. If you go there, count your change, because they obviously have a thief working there.
__label__1	I went to go view this place walked In the room walked right back out the rooms are Cracker Jack boxes
__label__1	I stopped by this place Monday 4/25/16 and ordered a breakfast sandwich. There were so many pieces of egg shell in it that I think it was done deliberately. If not, someone is very incompetent. A restaurant relies on the trust of their customers. This place lost mine.
__label__1	a big disappointment, food had no favor. just open a bag/can pour it in a pan heat/ serve.
__label__1	"When Yelping, consider the source. Those who have small ranges of experience have raved about Boca. Those who know better might wish it was great - but it isn't. 
What it is:
Pretentious.
Overpriced.
Unfulfilling.
Haughty.
Dull.
Tasteless.
 
How can you mess up free range chicken?. Bombard it with too much sage, dry it out, then plate it unimaginatively and allow cooling.

Smoke, the previous restaurant, was so much better.

Good place for a drink, then head out for food elsewhere."
__label__1	Impossible to get ahold of and not reliable. The office secretary has no idea who their employees are so getting ahold of a driver is nearly impossible and supervisors never call back. I've heard they used to be reliable but recently have gone down hill.
__label__1	Their Chinese bouncer would not let my friend in from France because he didn't speak straight English.  Won't be back til he's fired
__label__1	I only come here if I have to...hard to find good help, staff could be more knowledgeable.. decent selection of materials, just not my go to shop
__label__1	Food was ok, employees friendly but they are racist and generalize which was disrespectful, for them to be an attraction of PA( Big NO NO)
__label__1	Every time I visit this location (photo print department), I get good customer service. But today, there is this old lady named Cindy. She gave good service to the guy in front of me, but when it was my turn, all I got was an attitude and rolled her eyes at me. I did not purchase anything from her service, changed my mind and walked away due to her bad service. Please tell her to change her attitude. To be honest, I feel like she's treating me like that because of my ethnicity. Who knows!
__label__1	Been in the registration line for 3 hours and looks like there is an hour to go :( only here for one night and sucks that they have 1 registration area for 3 hotels!!
__label__1	I had to was so shocked to have to wait as long as I did the. To get my ticket / bill when I was still working on my drink Aracely was my server
__label__1	This business claims to sell turmeric soap. I purchased 60$ worth of soap two months ago I am unable to get any answers to why my Oder has not shipped yet please do not buy from these people it is a big SCAM!!!!
__label__1	No more margarita towers!! So annoyed! Literally the only reason I went. The food os average. Your typical tacos and nachos ‍. Definitely won't be back until the tower returns!
__label__1	Their food is amazing, when you actually get it. I wanted a bagel before work this morning. I sat in the drive thru almost 15 minutes and when I finally got to the window, they told me they didn't even have the bagel I wanted. I already had only 5 minutes left until I was supposed to start work, so I had to leave without getting breakfast. I will not be coming back, and I'm sure this place has lost a lot of its business because of how slow they are.
__label__1	Worst company I've ever rented from, moved into my unit with numerous issues and to make matters worse, I have mice!!!!! I was told a exterminator would come to solve the issue, no one EVER came! I have decided to put my money in escrow until the matters resolved. Save your money and rent with a cheaper and better company.
__label__1	Save your money and your taste buds its horribly mediocre! And the problem starts as soon as you walk in to be completely honest! And forget about taking your food back because they'll talk about why you decided to ask them to take the food back that you requested medium and they gave you rare. So while you wait you get to hear about how stupid you are for not knowing the difference but I actually know if i cut through it n before my knife even touches it and it bleeds it's RARE! NEVER AGAIN and I wish I can put no stars
__label__1	I have never been offered help as I bring packages into this store. I recently brought two large boxes and they all watched as I struggled to open the door, twice. I am 67 and you would think they would be more courteous.
__label__1	"Avoid this place like the PLAGUE. The manager believes women deserve to be sexually assaulted and ""security"" won't do anything but watch if you are being harassed."
__label__1	"Very ""hood"" Circle K location... The staff were professional & friendly. Too bad they don't appear to have a mask policy. They sell liquor & beer at this location which is always a  for us. I don't come here often, but every now & then when necessary."
__label__1	"I ordered through Door Dash. The pancakes were burned badly and the rest of the food wasn't very good-definitely not worth the price.I called Denny's and the manager on 1/25/21 at around 7pm said there was NOTHING that could be done because I ordered earlier in the day!! I told him I would never order from Denny's again and he said ""ok"". I guess they don't care about return customers."
__label__1	I would have given them 4 stars...have gotten their burritos many times, which are really good. But...placed a pick-up order & was shocked when I walked in the door to find the place very crowded. Maybe a couple of tables closed for social distancing. In fact while I was there, they accommodated a party of 4 that had no business being seated with how full the restaurant was. Very disappointing. I am not going to stop ordering pick-up from them because the food is good, just wish they were conducting business in a more responsible way during these infectious times.
__label__1	Lies, dishonesty, and sales people who will say anything to get you in the door. Once they think you want the suv they raise the the price at least $5,000 and that's just wrong. So I will never support this place again and will be telling others of my experience.
__label__1	Extremely disappointed with the service. They staff made me feel very uncomfortable and unwelcome. They gave me the wrong order and at the end, they charge me twice. Will not go back.
__label__1	We ordered a garlic chicken pizza last night.  The pizza did not have garlic on it and it was so blah, I didn't bother eating it.  We order from this store regularly, but in recent weeks, it's gone way downhill.  This isn't the first pizza we've gotten with missing ingredients.  It's a pizza and it doesn't take rocket science to make one.  The manager needs to make sure his employees are meeting the standards of making pizzas.  As it stands, it's a crap shoot as to what you get when you order a pizza.
__label__1	I will never go back to this Chili's.  The bartender is beyond rude. He literally flipped our table off because we ask the server to split our checks. The bartender is condescending, rude and makes you feel like a burden. He needs to find another profession. We called the GM and he didn't seem to care. To bad we love the food.
__label__1	I read the reviews and everyone talks about how this place is frozen in time (I love dives). The truth is it's an unclean, old place and the food - I had a chili dog and a hamburger - went in the trash after a few bites. If you want cheap, throw-back, go here but chug the Pepto first. Old doesn't mean quality.
__label__1	No spice. The kids chicken fingers  were tiny and the fried rice had very little chicken in it.  Not worth the price at all. I wouldn't even eat free food at this shitty place. I have no idea why it was busy.
__label__1	"We usually go to Kung Fu Tea in the suburbs, but in a trip here, we decided to try it.  The taro milk tea and Japanese green tea were very bland.  It wasn't even sweet despite the fact that we got charged ""sugar tax"" of $.24 (?) each!  It would have been nice to be made aware of this.  When we order at other places, even without sugar, it still has s hint of sweetness!  At least the Boba pearls were the proper consistency."
__label__1	Don't eat here unless you prefer unauthentic Vietnamese food poorly received and prepared by Chinese staff who speak neither English nor Vietnamese.
__label__1	Should have read reviews before ordering. It has bee an hour and a half and still no food. Terrible....
__label__1	"Buyer beware please make sure you get a copy of your contract when signing up. I originally signed up for a premium membership and downgraded to a $10.00 membership,  in order to downgrade your membership you must do it in person which I did. 
    They did not downgraded my membership for 2 payments and then changed back to charging the original membership. I was assured the problem would be taken care of with corporate which never happened instead I was turned into collection for non payment. Please beware."
__label__1	If u have bunch of time and can spend more than 1 hour on waiting..u can come...especially u have the chance to see other tables which are all later than u are eating food around u..
__label__1	"Save your money!

Stratospheric prices matched with slow, inferior service.

Don't fall for the ""don't hire a tailgate operation, go for the cadillac"".  

MANY call backs (5 at least)

I ended up tightening leaking fittings myself.

They left me swarmed w/ mosquitos for a MONTH because they couldn't be bothered to come out here and put a cap where they forgot one.

Move on!  This isn't rocket science.  

There are FAR cheaper gutter & rain harvesting choices out there-- and they'd HAVE to be better than this!"
__label__1	Dark skin girl manager was to busy smoking weed an flirting outside to help out her co workers , disgusting Never coming again
__label__1	If I could give this place no stars I would. They are constantly the slowest service I've ever had. Not to mention from my recent experience the woman working the drive thru had the absolute worst attitude towards us. when we drove up to get our food she didn't say a word just took the money. Shoved a receipt for my dad to sign in his face and just harshly gave us the bag of food. By far the worst customer service I have ever seen. When we attempted to call and complain, the person hung up the phone. I will never return to this location again. Horrible horrible service!
__label__1	Drove up to Clearwater from Largo on Saturday at 5:25 pm and the door was locked. Great reviews, but not open. Got takeout at Sonny's.
__label__1	This restaurant has the worst customer service. We waited for two orders of beignets for nearly a half hour!  The tables are dirty and they will not clean then until you've placed an order and received your food. Even then, you have to ask for the table to be cleaned. I ordered an egg omelet a previous time, and it was mediocre at best. I absolutely do not recommend this place. Wait in line at Cafe Du Monde, you'll still get better service.
__label__1	This embarrassment of a mall never actually had a chance. It is located almost  equidistant from Burlington, Willingboro and Mt. Holly. Each of these towns are economic disasters.
__label__1	This stores name is misleading. There are no wholesale pricing at all  in fact other pet stores are less money.
__label__1	Terrible  customer service bought a 20 piece wings that was cooked in burnt grease, my family ate a wing a piece equaling 4 they only returned part of my money saying they don't smell the burnt smell coming from the burnt chicken..bad business from an establishment in the neighborhood serving to people with such few options makes you think if it's Intentional?
__label__1	Bobby Chez des nt email daily specials anymore and it is difficult to access this information. Are they getting ready to close their doors?
__label__1	I've tried ordering from here 3 times, all three times they did not have what I ordered and my orders were canceled.  What kind of bbq place run out of all their bbq but still accepts orders to only cancel them.  I gave up on this place, good luck ordering delivery
__label__1	This company is a PIEACE OF SHIT, had a storage for 3 years on time, sometimes I paid 3 months in advance 3 weeks late this month and I receive a email stating I own a balance after checking out. I called and they said they cut the lock and there vendor picked everything up, no notifications from them, the only pictures of my kids I had are now gone. 3 weeks late. Never late before. Rates had increased by 100% in 3 years even though it's located in the poorest neighborhoods. Public storage are scum bags and thieves
__label__1	Horrible customer service . Definitely not have New Yorkers are I would know I'm from there.
__label__1	I have ate here twice since the Covid restrictions and both times the food was so greasy and made me sick.  I don't know if it is the grease or the food just sat out to long but it's nothing like I have ever had before from Long John Silver's. Disappointed
__label__1	"Admittedly, I'm a New York sushi snob. I've had Morimoto serve me dinner in Mumbai and I think Sugarfish is the bomb.
I travel the country for business and check Yelp regularly for the highest rated sushi joint wherever I am.
the two roles I ordered we're just mediocre.
The seared tuna and fresh salmon we're virtually inedible.
2 words for this place, ""don't bother"""
__label__1	They prescribed me a medication that i told them i was allergic to which is ILLEGAL and i will take up legal action that's malpractice and frankly fucking ridiculous.
__label__1	This place was horrible ! If you are a female and want to be severely mistreated by a male then come to this place .
__label__1	"this place is over price i had 2 amps capacitor and 2 subs and they did a hack job this  is just like tijuna but far more expensive . wires all exposed destroy carpet and drill holes all over the vehicle with disregard .
i wish ihad gone some place else.  and to think that i even tip the installers . i have showed the isntallation to other shops and friends and they cant belive i paid for that.
im giving this place one star rate couse they sure know how to charge and make it look good in theory."
__label__1	So I would like to say how much they scam people. They were charging my mom a higher rate so she called them. They gave her the same internet speed but try to get her to buy more. Every since she called the service have been very bad our house. Do anyone know of any internet service providers for a reasonable price, because this company ain't shit! It's disgusting how they get over on people for a service.
__label__1	We have called this location at least 10-15 times over the course of an hour no one ever picked up just rang and rang......completely terrible and super disappointing
__label__1	"Not my kind of place.
Service was not bad but definitely a little preoccupied with getting ready for something or someone else....even though there was only 1 other table occupied in the place at the time.
No thanks."
__label__1	Attended a movie here on 5/27/18.  Bought tickets on-line.  Convenience charge over 18% to buy tickets online through AMC Stubs.  Concession area very dirty.  Food service workers eating and drinking while waiting on customers.  Other food service workers prepping food on same counter customers stand at.  No manager available to talk to.  Concession prices excessive.
__label__1	Don't bother scheduling an appointment online. I made an appointment for 2:00 today. When I showed up, they looked at me like I had 5 heads when I gave my name and appointment time. The woman proceeded to tell me that they were behind and I would have to come back tomorrow. I ended up walking down the street to Wayne nails on South Wayne Ave and was taken immediately for a manicure with no wait.
__label__1	Rude service. No greeting, no acknowledgement that we were standing at the register to order... not a welcoming spot. Terrible first impression upon my first visit.
__label__1	"Been here for breakfast three times, before 10:00am.
Each time they have  run out beagles, except for everything began which in each case has been stale. Three strikes, you are out."
__label__1	The Vet who took care of my dog is good, professional and courteous even the one who removed the suture of my dog.  But sorry for giving 1 star because one of the lady working in the front desk is rude.  I thought this would be my dog's regular vet because they charge reasonable, clinic is outdated but at least it's clean and no smell.  But, I was disappointed with this front desk lady.  Be professional and be nice! You're not showing a good example to your co-workers and you are ruining the business.
__label__1	Small portions & the sauce lacks flavor. Maybe I'm just a pizza snob. They also are inconsistent with their delivery policy.
__label__1	Not worth it. You get about 5 soggy french fries with your steak or burger. Dry as a bone ribs. The vegetable medley definitely came out of a frozen bag. Not worth the price. The only good thing was the waitress. She was great.
__label__1	We had to take our car in for a repair. We had to wait a week and half for the part to be ordered, understandably. We take the car in and hear nothing back from them all day. We followed the progress on the app, which was none. More to come.
__label__1	I went to Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen. I ordered lemon pepper chicken with mac and cheese and a baked potato. When the food came to the table it was cold and when I advised the waitress. She was like ok so what do you want me to do. And my drink had watered down and she didn't bother to bring another until after the manager came out and spoke to me.
__label__1	"Teenage girl barista chatting with teenage girl customers for three minutes about nothing in particular while I thought their coffees were being made. Then she took their orders. Reminded me of the ""erhmagerd"" meme. And I was jetlagged. Just did a redeye. And desperately in need of coffee. 

I was seconds away from throwing tables.

FINALLY got to place my order and it was a standard interaction from that point forward. But seriously, talk to your friends in study hall, not when there's a line in a coffee shop on a REALLY slow morning."
__label__1	I called asking about frozen character fabric and said specifically it was for a kids mask. I was happily surprised when they said they had some. Turns out the pattern was massive and clearly not practical for what I said I needed. Really frustrating since I made a special trip and basically wasted an hour.
__label__1	I was at this bank depositing cash and all of a sudden the electricity goes out. They ask everyone to go to a different bank but the money i deposited never ended up in my account. How tf you gonna go to a bank and get robbed by the bank? Anyways i still never got my $60 back and no one will answer me. gdamn i hate bank of america. never come here unless you want to experience the 8th layer of hell.
__label__1	My husband order a 50.00 bouquet through FTD.  This florist is over an hour away from where it was to be delivered. The flowers were not fresh and just looked they were thrown in the vase.  Not sure why FTD uses such a place.
__label__1	It's 20 degrees outside and there is no heat in the building. They don't need to use refrigeration due to the frigid air in the building. It's warmer to drink your drink outside.
__label__1	This is terrible date night place. They are playing blaring pop music that completely ruins the mood. I can't hear the guy sitting across from me. The food is expensive and the atmosphere sucks. Don't come here
__label__1	My in laws love it here but every time I go with them, I always end up finding hair in every dish I've had. I'd rather not get a side of hair ball. Thanks
__label__1	"I shop here 2-4 times a week! Because it's walking distance. I don't think I have ever spent less than 5 minutes in line. 
This place is almost 20% MORE EXPENSIVE than Vons in Montecito. 

This Albertson's is the most expensive grocery store in the county! 
You think they could afford to have more than 2 lanes open when there are 10 people in one line!"
__label__1	Wanted to try this place after seeing one of their door hangers on mine, the female answering the phone was extremely rude, was huffing and puffing literally I wish I was exaggerating just bc I wanted to   change my wings wtf (t-_-). For all that don't hang up trash on my door and if you don't like your job QUIT
__label__1	"I have been going here for two years, every once in a while my take out is messed up, but not that bad. Today I was there and my entire order was messed up.I asked for sauce on the side for both. Ribs and chicken both were smothered in sauce. 
The only recommendation I have if you go there is check your order before you leave. I could not go back because of a hour drive.
Time to find a new rib place"
__label__1	All the servers appeared to be high on pills - glazed over eyes, SLOW and unkept hair/clothing.  I ordered a bean burrito and rice, and my partner orders quesadilla deluxe.  We each took 3 bites of our food, and immediately asked for the check and left.  The food was terrible.  Bland and chewy.   The service was incredible slow.  There were 5 tables of people for lunch on a Saturday and it took over and hour to get our food from when we sat down.
__label__1	Terrible customer experience today. I've been coming here for over a year to park and use their shuttle and was treated with such low class (when I've been giving them business for over a year). Go somewhere else
__label__1	I have been to this place all of one time and I vow to never go there again. The food is vile. I went there with my boyfriend just to order some simple homemade desserts. USUALLY, homemade desserts are pretty good. HOWEVER, I walked out of there wanting to throw up. The service was terrible. Our waitress was so rude and arrogant. I was extremely displeased. I do not recommend this place to anyone unless you have a serious hankering for some crappy, badly made food.
__label__1	I have produced over 700 events and I have never had someone not call me back to produce an event at their venue. I wanted to bring Emmy award winning comedian, Leslie Jordan, to the Italian club for Tampa pride and I could not get Mark Stanish to call me back. I tried a dozen times to get this venue to call me and I finally gave up. I will host another sell out event with Leslie in Atlanta! Too bad for Tampa
__label__1	I just stopped in with my wife for a quick dinner in our way home. My dinner was awful. Mashed potatoes were cold, green bean were cold. Ordered the specials and they wee pretty special awful. Do not waste your time or money here!!!!!!
__label__1	"Walked in to have my implants adjusted. They don't do same day appointments. Fine made the appointment. They were running, which after reading seems to be norm. Anyways, Dr comes in and say before he even looked at my concern. "" I normally don't like adjust other people's work"" trying to get that there's really no money in me adjusting your impants. Long story short if it's not a big money ticket to submit to insurance this alleged Dr don't want to do it. Most of the staff looked like they were on work release. STAY AWAY"
__label__1	Important to note, this is for the Grant Road location.  Very disappointing.  TWICE now. My girlfriend and I really like the River Road location but, the last two times we walked into the Grant Road store, we were seated and ignored for about  15 minutes. Not a very busy night. We finally walked out. We won't return.
__label__1	I ordered flowers for my fiancé on his birthday! We live far so this was the only way to send him my love and wishes. I'm highly disappointed! Flowers he got does not look fresh or beautiful at all. They look amazing when I ordered but the ones he got look cheap shit flowers ordered from some cheap third class shop!! It's disgusting! Never ordering again in future! I do not recommend!
__label__1	Don't waste your time!!!!  Spent $20 to get in on a Sunday night. Only one patron. Sat thru 2 songs and no dancers on the stage, just sitting around bored. Tried to get $ back when we told by manager dancers were on a break that they would be back on stage. Break from what?!?! Sitting to much. Like I said don't waste your time!!
__label__1	New in town. Went in without a reservation and was told the wait was 2.5 hours.  My brother went in 20 minutes after we left and was seated immediately with no reservation.  We will be sticking to Reilly Pizza & Drink.
__label__1	"Came in this morning to grab a coffee and a bagel but instead the barista decided to give me a lesson on politics and racism. My friend was wearing an Archie bunker t shirt which the barista described as ""racist"". She told him his shirt was not great to be wearing in ""this political climate. She  even continued to discuss it with the next people in line. I get it everyone has an opinion but it's not always needed. Salem bagel is hella good but next time tell your barista that t shirt shaming guests isn't part of a 5 star customer experience."
__label__1	They refuse to honor their own coupons, and gift certificates. This has happened twice to me at this restaraunt.
__label__1	"I Used to go there all the time and I decided to try them again. 
I got a pedi, mani and gel on my finger nails. Gel is already peeling off day 5."
__label__1	This the worst experience I have ever had. Stay away from this place. I was there for a couple hours, the provided zero assistance, zero solution, just want your money. They will bill you for services customers never receive. Insurance companies beware. They scammed Me and they will scam you. if you are seeking a bad experience go visit them. This is where malpractice is practiced.  Go somewhere else.  They will send you to collections even if you pay and never resolve the issue. My insurance paid forays they still ruined my perfect credit score!!!!
__label__1	I am so tired of trying to support restaurants and their employees through these times only to have orders screwed up time after time!! Does nobody understand that an order that is not picked up by the purchaser is that much more important to be RIGHT!!! Uber eats, Grubhub these companies are doing their best along with those of us using them to ensure businesses survive yet the employees can't take time to ensure that the order is correct and timely when it leaves!!! No sauce on my wings, no sauce even placed in the bag..
__label__1	Sure, the place has history, but if you're really want to hear good current country western writers and singers visit the listening Cafe. Good food plenty of seating excellent prices great bar service and you're sitting right next to Nashville's next big stars
__label__1	Set up an appointment for the one time we could meet people at the home as we live out of town. Their office called and cancelled an hour before the appointment, once we already drove 2 hours to be at the home to meet them. For us, it was very disorganized in dealing with their office staff from the first call to the last and also very disappointing to have them cancel on us last minute.
__label__1	The worst customer I have even experienced! They made mistake about the departure time of my flight, which almost led me miss my flight! No one could deserve such BAD service!
__label__1	Worst dunkin ive ever been to!!! The service...TRASH!! The staff was so disrespectful. There were 4 of them at the register i asked for a pack of sugar, they looked at me and continued speaking among themeselves.
__label__1	I'm writing this a one star just for the logistics of it. No warning that even though its 32 degrees and freezing you have to park a half mile mile away. Do you think they give you a shuttle? Nope - walk.  Friendly attendants who help you navigate? Ha! Nope.  You are cattle and it was a horribly disorganized experience with people crossing in front of cars ... and no one helping.  Awful!!
__label__1	This place has been a nightmare for me. 8 months ago I bought a hood for $455 with my bank card. 2 months later they charged the same $455 again! Then tell me I have to wait 2 weeks to get it back.  Thought it was over.   Well tonight 8 months later I see the did it again!!  Bills overdue because of them !!  I'll be changing my bank info tomorrow..
__label__1	The establishment would not give us time to inquiry on the wait over the phone. 4 times I was placed on hold for 4 minutes and wasn't able to get a word in when the phone was answered. If they can not answer a simple question of how long the wait time is, I will take my business some place else.
__label__1	"Wanted some medium heat Pad Thai and got bland, flavorless Pad Thai. Barely had sauce on it let alone NO heat. I tried to ask for extra cilantro and bean sprouts and they charge an extra $1 for each. We're not very pleasant and the Pad Thai barely had chicken. 

I also ordered Crab Rangoons and they were hallow. The sauce and flavor was great but they had close to nothing inside. Very disappointed as I had heard great things about the restaurant."
__label__1	After reading reviews I was skeptical about going here.  I decided to give it a try for a free consultation.  Showed up early for appt and was left sitting for 45 minutes no doctor, no updates.  To me it was a bad sign of how this place is run.  We left.
__label__1	"Within seconds of sittings down the ""owner"" asked us to leave after placing an order of 13+ drinks for our group. Without any explanation what's so ever. Big bummer as we started our night here. This might be first time I EVER was asked to leave without provocation. Can't rate food or drinks due to this horrible experience. NEVER AGAIN."
__label__1	This is how Bella Vista's GM treats her paying customers, whom had a great time, and loved our server!!!
__label__1	If you come here you are a sure damn idiot it's embarrassing asf to Tucson this guy slappy is cringe asf and a bootleg scammer
__label__1	Wait 10 minutes before order is taken, then another 10 before incorrect order is out.  Then another 5 before the same incorrect order comes back to you.  I know help is hard to find, but how hard can it be?
__label__1	If you ever need an existential battle of the human spirit, or if your soul needs to be exposed to the absolute worst outside of war, famine, or plague...if you want to stare into the abyss and ask for a higher power to answer back...have a seat, and wait 14 hours to be seen...then the real fun begins...
__label__1	I had to wait an hour and a half for my food. My waitress gave me water and then never came back. Eventually I had to pull her aside and ask when our food will be ready and she didn't even bring it out. I am never coming back
__label__1	I have lived in Eastlake Woodlands for 2 years . I bought my Condo in March 2017 . I have used the same HVAC company for 2 years now  which is an outstanding company . Jennie the owner is professional, trustworthy and very friendly!! I have notice this company Oldsmar Air Conditioning putting there stickers as advertising without any approval from our HOA . This is disturbing and not appropriate for a company to do  to gain business . I would not recommend using a Shady company like this one .
__label__1	I ordered Pastrami with Swiss Melt---fucking shit. I got 2 slices of pastrami as part of the sandwich. Really?
__label__1	Worst place to go if anything is wrong. They don't care about their patience well being and just dismiss anyone who walks in the front door. I haven't met one person in that hospital that actually seems like they enjoy their job. Doctors and nurses are supposed to be compassionate and have sympathy and that's not what you get at this hospital. I would rather fall over and die then come here again.
__label__1	The music was so loud it was miserable.  We left before we even ordered after we paid a stupid cover to watch a band that went on break when we walked in. You would have thought the music would have been more muted after the band was off stage. That was not the case. This is not the same experience We have had at this place. In the past.   The hostess was less than friendly because we walked in without a reservation.   Really???
__label__1	Back again... first time since 9 months ago hoping maybe things are better.  Nope.  No idea why this Bdubs is like this... avoid unless you have LOTS of time and are addicted to bdubs sauces.
__label__1	I would not consider Pigeon's at this time because they do not properly follow CDC guidelines. Wearing masks below the nose is not worth wearing one at all.
__label__1	Seriously, how do you screw up Sweet and Sour Chicken so badly???  Honestly it tasted like they deep fried the chicken the day before... it was that horrible!!
__label__1	Cannot seem to deliver curbside timely. If you order ahead, expect to wait. This is my second time in two weeks so it's a trend. Also dining room closed 2 hours early. I suspect the have hiring issues.
__label__1	The soup is bitter. The dishes are very salty. Have to drink water by every bite. The waiter's attitude are rude. A disappointing place for dinner
__label__1	At first impression, I really liked the vet but....After spending $1300 to get my pup evaluated , I was completely ignored with unanswered questions. I do not know what the cause is of a serious issue and I do not know what further can be done to help him. I am frustrated and disappointed in the care of my dog.   All I wanted was some questions answered. All I needed was a five minute call back, but NOTHING. So sad to me because this is such an important type of care needed in our community.
__label__1	use real people to speak to a person. not a long drawn conversation with a machine. give some people a job. just put on customer service.  frank sawczuk    43 ivy lane new castle de 19720 2350
__label__1	I made an APPOINTMENT at 5pm, and 5 minutes after I checked in they took 3 WALK INS back. I was the only one in the waiting room at this point!! Now it is over an HOUR after my appointment time and we still have yet to see a doctor. This place is a JOKE. I blame this on the girl with glasses at the front desk with the horrible attitude.
__label__1	We had one drink. Would have had more if not for horrible service. Great music but doesn't make up for bad service. Took 15-20 minutes just to get bill, after swearing at bartender. Bad experience.
__label__1	Maybe it's because it's in a high traffic tourist neighborhood, but I was expecting a lot better food here. Everything we got was swimming in a pound of butter, and I did not leave feeling like we got our moneys worth. It felt like instead of making good food, they just decided butter would do the job. Not good.
__label__1	Awful. Food was awful service was mediocre, ambiance was terrible, no one was in the restaurant and the breakfast food was made in the pizza kitchen. They had to ask us if we wanted silverware and gave us ketchup packets. I will never go back here. It's unfortunate bc it's a good spot!
__label__1	This place is terrible. I've written another review about the lack of care the staff gives their patrons but today is a different story. The staff sucks, the menu sucks, the prices are terrible. The people that work here are so slow at their jobs.
__label__1	Both my husband and I separately agreed that the chicken chimichanga tasted like vomit and the rice side was comically small. I am so disappointed and confused how this place has such good reviews.
__label__1	"I hate direct TV!! Don't fall into the trap they set. They say they give you everything for a cheaper cost, the only reason it's cheep is because they only give you have the channels. You have to buy the others. they don't even give you ESPN!! I go to turn it on and you have to buy it separately. 
They told me I'd get 3 free units and they charged me for them!!! Go with Comcast Xfinity!"
__label__1	"*sigh*
I tried again. 
I ordered a loan catfish sandwich via mobile order.  I had mustard ,pickles , and hot sauce selected. 
They legit gave  me onions, pickles,  and hot sauce.  Seriously?
Yeah done."
__label__1	We were there about a month ago.  The garlic bread was very good.  The décor is very outdated - dark and not clean.  My chair felt like it was going to break.  There was little customization of food - asked for one item to be omitted from a pasta dish and was told it could not be done.  Food was not good at all.  Would not recommend this place.
__label__1	Not even a one star. Soup was too salty and They charge me 20% tip without disclosure. Lady got emotional and was arguing they should charge 20% for group. Hilarious!
__label__1	My earlier assessments of the Creative Group remain the same. Response to emails and voicemails leaves much to be desired.
__label__1	I do not like giving poor reviews for businesses as I believe good reviews forgive and support well-intentioned business owners, but I cannot do so for Tampa Buffet. Except for sushi that had JUST been made at our request, the quality, taste, texture and temperature of the majority of the food was so bad that we will not return here. It looked like garish food coloring was added to some dishes, others were rubbery or dried out, others were greasy and not even warm, and there were very few shrimp dishes (my husband's usual favorite). Time to find a new buffet destination.
__label__1	Everything went very well up until weeks after the completed delivery I received an invoice for an overweight charge. Having read several reviews prior to shipping of this happening I made sure to have my shipment weighed at a certified scale. I contested the charge and provided the weight print out as well as documentation showing the weight of the same item from other sources. Months later I was told my claim was denied. No documentation was given. Was just simply told it was denied. I appealed. Months later same thing.
__label__1	I used to come here. Their Teddy Bear hamsters are full of mites. One look at their mammals will tell you to STAY AWAY.
__label__1	This is the WORST Walmart. Some employees are very RUDE and unprofessional. Today, one employee who was in her own clothes, no name badge, and probably not even on the clock was being very rude.  I know there is a Pandemic because I am a nurse; but you don't have to be RUDE towards people!
__label__1	Regrettably I gave this embarrassing store another chance and things have only gotten worse. 1.5 hour delivery, cold food, awful interactions with the staff. This place just needs to close it's atrocious.
__label__1	I was impressed visually when I entered Argento's on Saturday and the staff was friendly and welcoming. We ordered the Bang Bang Calamari, it was so-so. The alfredo sauce we ordered with our bread sticks was watered down and very thin in consistency. Although the salads were fresh, the house dressing was very bland. It took over an hour for our entrees to arrive at the table and was sub-par to say the least. I am sad to say that Argento's was a disappointment and I won't be back.
__label__1	This is the worst service I have ever seen. We were told the waiting time was 30 mins. Then it became 1:30mins. After one hour, it added another 45 mins while there were many empty tables. Thx manager even didn't feel sorry. Stay out of this restaurant.
__label__1	Do not get the buffet. I ended up eating English muffin and peanut butter after trying biscuits and gravy, sausage and an omelet. Yep they were all bad. My son and I had breakfast included and couldn't stomach it a 3rd day and had muffins at Starbucks.
__label__1	I had an appointmnet scheduled from 11-3. At 1:00 I called to check in and left them a message. I called again at 2 and was told they were running behind and that someone would be here by 3:30.  It's 3:45 ans still no repair man.  WOW.  If they weren't sent through home warranty company I would have already called someone else.
__label__1	Very thirsty, my urine was yellow before coming here. Waited 57 minutes for a refill. Very dehydrated, my pee is becoming solid. Happy about free pie tho.
__label__1	I was very disappointed with my order to go, the rice was not a seasoned yellow rice, more like yellow dyed rice, the picadia was also bland and not very flavorful, portions were small, but I guess that is what Temple Terrace calls authentic Spanish Food !!
__label__1	I brought my daughter ( who is pregnant) and son-in-law here for lunch today. We waited an hour and a half (I had to ask for bread for my daughter who was starving!). Then we waited another 15 minutes and asked about our order-- the waitress came back and said, oh, I don't know what happened they lost your order. No apology, nothing, and the manager just shook his head. What kind of customer service is that? My starving pregnant (now crying) daughter, son-in-law and I left.
__label__1	"I would give no stars if I could!!!!!
Went to go eat and got our kids McDonald's knowing they wouldn't eat bbq. After we sat down and our kids were already eating and seen by workers so guy comes out and tells us they can't eat their food. We were outside eating and no one said anything until he came out. We were about to order food from there but they lost our business. And he said he was the manager and was super rude!!!!!! Don't go here!!!"
__label__1	Last week I placed an online order, but got a call saying it would be 2 hours, so I canceled. Ordered online tonight & it said about an hour. After 1 1/2 hours it showed up. It was cold and looked disgusting. I heated up a slice & it was horrible. I called and got the manager on the phone only to get every excess... the rain, broke down driver, blah blah  blah. I told her I was done ordering there and she got a total attitude and hung up on....Avoid and spend your $20 somewhere else, like I will
__label__1	I usually don't have any problems with this Wawa, but at 3:28 I get a cup of coffee that was barely warm it didn't even produce steam and I try to tell the lady and her response was I just made it. Do you condone your employees lying and selling cold beverages that are supposed to be hot? Disappointed Wawa! Not that this or doing your surveys does any good they don't even acknowledge if you have had horrible service
__label__1	I'm sorry, but we must of went there on a bad day. I don't know what was is our ravioli but it didn't resemble meat. The Italian beef tasted old and the meatballs on the sandwich were like rubber and had little hard bits in them like bone. All tossed in the trash, barely eaten.
__label__1	"The WORST ""Italian"" food I've ever had in all my years on this earth! 
Not a single person working here was actually Italian so no wonder they served us fake uncultured 
Food. We initially sat outside because we thought it was going to be nice but the sun was beaming down on us and they refused to change our seats even though they had plenty of open spots on the inside. I recommend Olive Garden over this place or even pasta you find in dumpsters. And to top it all off our bill for 2 simple pastas was $65 
These people should not be in business at all!"
__label__1	Worst place to take your pets they are mean to them yelling at them and hitting them ive watched the girls in the room behind the glass hit the dogs on the head and sides the owner isn't any better by allowing it to happen everyone in the place looks to be on drugs especially the employees  in the room behind the window i dont know why anyone would want someone on drugs to groom there pet there my dog has been there a few times and will never go back ive even reported them to the better business Bureau for there crappie work they do
__label__1	This place seemed good, until the made in China sticker was found on the pots. Overpriced crap from China! Sick
__label__1	Security was extremely rude. We waited in line fair and square for over an hour and got accused of cutting the line. The security guard was being spiteful because one of the people in our group went to the bathroom while waiting in line. Have some pride in your job!
__label__1	I'm sure the chicken is fine, but they ran out of it at 6:30 PM on a Friday night. Unfortunately they didn't have a sign at the drive through so we were stuck with people in front of us and behind us. 30 to 40 minute wait for chicken. I asked why they didn't put a sign out letting people know before they got stuck in the drive through. No answer. And when we finally got our order which was a whole chicken, 2 breasts,2 thighs,2 legs and 2 wings, we got 2 breasts, 1 thigh, 1 leg and 4 wings.
__label__1	"Impolite man up front. 
Cash up front before job is done. This place does not take debit or credit.
Poor customer service."
__label__1	HORRIBLE HOSPITAL! They care more about their stupid restrictions than they do about people!  So sick of this place!  Was kicked out by the administrator because i came a little earlier than visitor hours to bring my husband's a decent breakfast and get him ready to go home.  Was told to wait in the lobby until 11.  What was i hurting?  It's their fault that's he's dying of cancer because of all their restrictions over the last year.
__label__1	Have been there before, slow service but food was good. This time left without ordering. Waited for 15 minutes before a waiter came to the table, he was rude. Another 15 minutes to get a beer. Still wasn't asked if we wanted an appetizer, then he took another tables order that came in after us. We left after that, will not go back
__label__1	Right now they do not allowed clients to try any clothes in store.  when I back home I felt not right size for me. When I returned back they said They could not accept my returns because I did not bring my receipt. I had my original payment card and pants with original tag. Their attitude so bad.Other stores all accept returns even do not have receipts. It is bad!
__label__1	Waste of money! Way too expensive for what they have for the dirty, boring young scenes.
__label__1	called a week in advance to get a service call early before we opened but no show on time to be here call them and get told that person for my job is at another finishing up and might be there in an hour well were are open at that time at no work can be preformed didn't seem concerned cancelled them and will find someone else
__label__1	Went to Schlesinger's for the first time. Ordered and paid for matzo ball soup to go. Get home -- no matzo ball. Ordered toast for chicken salad sandwich. Toast burnt. Fries under cooked. Asked for biscotti to go. Again...paid but no biscotti. For a $67 check.. very disappointing.
__label__1	Went for happy hour was charged $7 for an IPA, after asking the bartender if that was the happy hour price, he knocked $1 off the price. Possibly one of the worst happy hours in the city. Won't ever be coming here again.
__label__1	This was the worst experience I've ever had at this establishment.  I arrived at 12:30 am and got no service.  The sign says they are open until 1:00 am. I pulled up to the second window and saw a dirty counter top and no one in sight. Never going to this location EVER again.
__label__1	"Update:

Deb G.  Thanks! And your beer tastes like the garbage truck on Chico and the Man."
__label__1	We waited 5 minutes to get seated while one of the workers saw us waiting and walked outside to smoke a cigarette. Our waiter was very nice and pleasant. The food was good and cheap. But i definitely think they should be more organized as to seating customers
__label__1	I used to eat here pretty often but they have messed up my order the last three times that I have came in. Today I ordered a breakfast burrito with avocado and no sour cream. They charged me for avocado and didn't add any and there was a ton of sour cream on my burrito.
__label__1	"Incredibly rude. This business had a confusing means of parking. When I did not understand, I parked and went inside. The attendant was incredibly rude and started arguing with me. After I apologized (should I even have to?) the business owner continued to express how I did not pay attention. I finally said ""Would you like my business or not?"" he replied, ""It's up to you."" Then I promptly left. Low price or not, poor customer service has no place in a business."
__label__1	"I'll get straight to the point. In my opinion...

PROS: Clean establishment, fast service and cheap prices, Rice was ok.  

CONS: Really bland food I was not satisfied at all with the entrees. 

Will not return as I already have a go to spot."
__label__1	Don't get fooled by the positive reviews. We were visiting Tampa and stopped for dinner. The food was stale and bland. Find a better place to eat.
__label__1	"had the worst meal of my life here. horrible.
caveat: it was probably about a year ago
so I would try again to see if it got better... but haven't done it yet cause it was really that bad."
__label__1	I can't even rate it a 1. This place is horrible. My husband booked us a couple massage. When we got there. They didn't even have our names wrote in the appt book. My husband booked it two days prior our appt. So with that said, the owner or the lady at front desk said sorry but there is nothing we can do. WTF, umm yes there is something you can do... Give us 1/2 off or something like that.  There is always something you can do. Will never go back. Plus we were coming from the West Bank area
__label__1	"Too many reschedules!! Booking your follows ups months out and then getting a call cancelling the day before the appointment is ridiculous and this happened on numerous occasions. I also had a facial scheduled with a follow up and was told it could not be performed because they were over scheduled.
Oh, and they closed their Brandon location without notice. This place is terribly run, highly inefficient, and does not care about their patients at all."
__label__1	Horrible. Really bad. Worst customer service I've ever experienced by their manager and also several sales associates.
__label__1	"BEWARE!!!
 GANDER MOUNTAIN PROTECTION PLAN
 I bought this because the cashier told me that it covered stains in shirts. I stained the shirt the first day I wore it and now they claim it is not their policy. THEY WOULD NOT EVEN REFUND THE MONEY I SPENT ON THE PURCHASE PLAN. 
 I absolutely hate business' that misrepresent themselves
 GOODBYE GANDER MOUNTAIN....
 This isn't about the money.. It's about the deception!"
__label__1	"I'll never go to your bar again. 

Gave the bartender 40 bucks for a Ketel One Rocks. Didn't realize until I'd handed the money back to my husband that the bartender had only given me 16 bucks back. Surely your drinks don't cost 24 dollars.

Too late to turn around and say something on a busy Saturday night.

So, either your bartender put someone else's drink on me or pocketed the extra cash. I couldn't say either way with authority.

Plenty of other bars that won't dick over people to go to in this city."
__label__1	Worst Chinese food I ever had everything was hard like it's was sitting in a buffet and I know they don't have one I live 5 blocks away and it took an hour and a half everything  was cold the wonton soup was sitting so long they were in a million pieces and the order was wrong this place use to be good , don't waste you time woke up with food poisoning
__label__1	Bread tasted old and was dry. Beef had no flavor and there was hardly any provolone. This is a big disappointment and will definitely hurt the brand name over this airport excuse.
__label__1	Just went in to this LA fitness location with my friend to use one of his guest passes and we were both treated very disrespectfully. Ben the employee had no manners... did you take too much roids buddy?? Someone better make some changes at this trash box of a gym
__label__1	I gave them a deposit on a job, picked out a slab they supposedly paid for and then nothing. I sued them in small claims court, and won, and still have not been paid out. Buyer beware.
__label__1	I purchased a Groupon for Big Shakes and went to their location on Murfreesboro Rd. We ordered and when we went to pay with the Groupon, we were told that it was for another location. When I told them that I didn't want the order I was told that I had to pay since I already ordered. We finally did eat there and the food was so greasy that we couldn't eat it and left.k
__label__1	Over priced food. Great beer selection but careful, we went during happy hour and my beer was $12 with $1 off. They should re-think the kids menu, $7 for a 1/4 of a kraft mac&cheese box, seriously?
__label__1	We came for my fiancé's birthday dinner, the service was so slow and horrible and the restaurant was empty. We can with a party of 14 and spent so much money. But our food came out barley warm. This sucked we won't be back.
__label__1	I ordered here often until one order I received, mu shu pork, the wraps that come with it were all green molded. I don't order here anymore.
__label__1	"The latest victim of the labor shortage. Which we understand, except they were not honest about how long our food would take. The hostess kept telling us ""10 more minutes"" on our online order only for us to be waiting and standing around for an hour. Do better."
__label__1	Meh. This place used to be decent. Ordered the sesame chicken more like sesame breading.  Pieces had absolutely no meat. Don't waste your money. I'll drive to ginger or jasmine next time.
__label__1	brought home chicken for myself and my cats.  All three cats refused to eat the chicken? I found this odd because they love chicken.  ALL chicken.  I ate three pieces of chicken and an hour later I went to bed. I experienced a horrible headache all night long. I was unable to quench my thirst. Drinking liquids made all night kept me in the bathroom all night. They obviously use MSG in their marinade or some other process.  I am not even sensitive to MSG. Needless to say, I will NEVER eat at this restaurant again. I will also never eat chicken that my cats turn down
__label__1	Do not use your credit card at this location! I just found a charge on my bank account for three times the price of my meal with tip. It's just sad that this restaurant has resorted to scamming their customers.
__label__1	This is one of those expensive small personal sized pizza places that guys take their girlfriends for a date but would never go to themselves. Sloppy, soggy, overpriced. If you want a real pizza go to Angelo's down the street.
__label__1	"the lady went completely past my cuticle and said ""whoops"" when she saw it bleeding. there is also dip all over my fingers. they also charged my mom the same amount for my tips and gel as hers and she had her acrylic taken off and gel put on"
__label__1	I've tried this place a couple of times and am not impressed. If you see their commercials you'd expect some semblance of Louisiana style food at a fast food place. Both times I've been there the staff is very distracted acting, as if you're an inconvenience to them. The food on the first visit, fried chicken, was about what you'd expect from a cheap fast food eatery. On the second visit I ordered the white chicken deal. When I got home and opened it, it contained three wings. Two tries is all they get from me
__label__1	So this place might have been great....once. Chef left a month ago. Came in on a Saturday night and there was NO ONE here. Ordered the fries & dumplings. Fries were soooo salty even the beer couldn't erase the flavor. Do. Not. Go. Here. Wasted $30.
__label__1	This place is going downhill due to constantly changing managers and cooks walking out (we've heard this twice in the last two weeks).  Our food took nearly an hour to arrive, half of it was cold, and we had to flag our waitress down to even get coffee refills.  Half our section was empty, too.  Run horribly and half-ass.  An embarrassment.
__label__1	do not use this guy! he's a thief and after he rip you off he won't take your calls! check him out at the bbb! check out his reviews on other websites! he's ripped off sooo many people! you've been warned!!!
__label__1	Dreadful. Do not got there.  I keep getting e-mails and comments regarding what happened to my sons cat and similar incidents resulting in death with this vet. Just stay away. Please find someone else.   This town is crawling with them.  Go else where. Save your pets life and your self some grief.  Please.
__label__1	If you read this establishments job postings  it's quite clear that as to why there are so many problems. Very few people with strong work ethics would seek employment here under the terms offered.
__label__1	"Ordered online the girl at the front was a brat! I asked for a side of bread stick seasoning and she said they can't do that! I let her know I do this whenever I order from here. She seemed to be annoyed and got me the seasoning, angrily shaking it into the small plastic cup. She didn't know how to use pay machine and I asked her if I should swipe again and she didn't know! 
I get home and our pizza is undercooked and gross! What a waste of $16."
__label__1	Came to this place around 8 an hour before they closed. They told me that they could not serve me because the kitchen closed in 45 minutes. I drove an hour out here to eat. They should advertise this so people don't waste their time and gas.
__label__1	"I give this place five stars for it's dreadfulness. I have no idea why, but it is the worst bar I have ever been to. Nice decor and great location, but feels like a morgue. 

Please go and tell me why it is so terrible."
__label__1	Rented a car from this terrible company. First of all they hold 600 dollars on your credit card, pathetic, secondly the car was dirty, thirdly winter time no scraper for windows & last but not least No windshield fluid to clean windows. Call to discuss situation with manager, of course there was none available, still waiting to hear back from someone. So please do yourself a favor and NEVER rent a car from dollar rental car on Cypress Rd in St. Louis, Mo. Never!
__label__1	The worst gas station ever! Multiple pumps always malfunctioning or broken! Never getting gas here again!
__label__1	"Terrible customer service. One employee in particular. A ""team leader"" is rude to customers and her fellow employees. When brought to the manager's attention nothing is done. Because of her will be taking business to the co-op where customers are treated like their business matters."
__label__1	"This place sucks mightily. I specifically asked them to vacuum the inside of the car, but I think they just rolled the vacuum machine next to the car and stood there. A total waste of $20. Plus the staff is rude and condescending, even to the point of making fun of customers ""pos"" cars while they cleaned them. What a scam. Better off going to the drive through at the gas station."
__label__1	"I never have gone to a nail salon where they try to turn you away if you don't have an appointment. How annoying? And they really only do have 2 employees. I complained the first time that they barely cut my cuticles. The pedicure more was like a polish change.


Came for my last groupon visit and fist she picked a brown for my French pedicure then did a horrible job painting it.  Sat me down for my gel manicure and the left saying five minutes. Been waiting for 20 at this point"
__label__1	WILL NEVER COME BACK HERE EVEN IF THEY WERE GIVING THE FOOD AWAY! First time here and they hung up on me before I finished my order and then got upset because it was wrong. Told me the menu on the website was three years old with old prices so why not update it? Good food with good service is everywhere, don't need to put up with disrespect no matter how good there food is supposed to be.
__label__1	Called during their posted business hours and there was no answer and no voicemail. Went to their website and posted a message but did not get a call back or any response.
__label__1	The worst service and food I have seen in a long time.  Workers are rude and food awful.  I threw most if what I finally got away.  Stay clear of this dump.
__label__1	"After my experience on my birthday January 30th,I doubt if I will return to the Trolley Car Diner anytime soon.
I had been eating there since 2008,and had ""never"" had a bad meal or bad experience until this past January.I use to brag about this place once upon a time.Now,not so much.It's,IHOP from here on out.I""'ll give it a year and check back then."
__label__1	Really disappointed in the way this venue handled the event. Got there plenty early, waited in line for an hour before deciding to sell our tickets. I've seen Claude Von Stroke at Union Transfer and Morgans Pier and all three of those shows were fantastic, with both venues handling the crowd in perfect form. I understand it must have been exciting for Coda to finally have a line for a show but the whole thing was just bad form. Terrible management, unfair to the talent. Will not go back and will tell everyone that will listen.
__label__1	"When you walk in its small and unattractive.  The carpet has multiple stains (not a good first impression).  They gave  my room to somebody else.  Charged me for 2 different rooms.  Had to wait 30 minutes before they gave me somebody else's room (feel bad for the people coming in behind me).  
STAY AWAY!!!!"
__label__1	Being a vendor for them since 2015 and the last year they haven't payed there bill. Now know will contact me by phone or email. They are trying to blow me under the rug being a small family owned company. I have to reach out to them numerous times. If they pay there bill I will take this review down. See how long this takes. May 31st at 10:30 am
__label__1	Would give zero stars if I could.  Used to be my favorite but they have changed something in the last year or so.  Now the pretzels taste flat or just bad.  Ick.
__label__1	DO NOT GO HERE- Horrible customer service, the lady taking orders is rude as hell and has a lousy attitude. Very disappointed with customer service and the care they give their clients. THERES SO MANY OTHER PLACES YOU CAN CHOOSE FROM.
__label__1	Terrible experience. The food was good but the service was subpar, at best. They were slow, disrespectful, and as a party on a time crunch, they were extremely lacking in urgency. I will never be back. I don't recommend that you go.. there's better restaurants where they appreciate your business.
__label__1	Vile. I've eaten here and it was good. Tonight was just awful. Every single thing. I couldn't even bite through the chicken. Or tear it with my hand. Everything was inedible. We threw it away and ate peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. Guess they don't care about delivery or carry out.
__label__1	"Has nice curb appeal, good piano player, has ""kitchen"" in the title. Sounds promising. Only gave a star to the piano player and the drinks, otherwise a 0 stars if possible. Food is ALL microwaved or toaster ovened, there is no ""kitchen"". Food was bland, server kept trying to take my food prematurely before I was done. Next time I will just get some food from the food cart and sit near the restaurant to hear the music, or just order drinks at the bar."
__label__1	Poor poor customer service never in my life will come here again worst server in America Sarah was disgusting rude please don't come here if you want good service
__label__1	Food was horrible. Came out ice cold. Appetizer came out 5 minutes after the main entrees. Kid's Mac & cheese looked like it was sitting out for a few hours (Congealed and dark colored).
__label__1	"Weak drinks, mediocre food. Automatic 18% gratuity do no incentive for the servers to do their job. Pitchers were all ice and no margarita. You have to flag down someone just to get a napkin or a refill. 

Oh, and their computers were down, so after trying to get our servers attention and finally writing down my info so they could charge me when they came back up, their manager texts this to arrange payment - so yeah. Don't go to this cheap, trashy establishment. Rude and honestly so not worth it."
__label__1	Went there last night for my boyfriends 21st birthday and the security guard on the rooftop called me RETARDED because he was convinced one of my male friends went into the females restroom? Maybe you shouldn't drink on the job to keep your head straight. But will be filing a report on this bar because of their discrimination issues against people who are mentally handicapped.
__label__1	This place is filthy. Bathrooms had layers of vomit, no toilet paper, and cups upon cups piled up in the sink. Drinks were mediocre. I will not be coming back.
__label__1	Lash female in this Lounge is super unprofessional. I had a appointment set for 3:30 to wait in the lobby until 4pm. She comes out to then tell me that she doesn't have time for my lashes etc.. because she had to get her nails done for a weekend trip. I would advise hiring someone with a good work ethic before they ruin your name.
__label__1	"I love Hattie b's but I hate this location . For some reason they get lazy with the hot sauce for the chicken and  will only have about 2 lines of hot sauce through the whole chicken when I asked for ""medium"" and my boyfriend asks for ""mild"" somehow we end up with 2 lines of hot sauce and the rest is plain chicken. I have to ask for a container of hot sauce to pour on it myself because apparently they don't know how to put the right hot sauce on the chicken anymore."
__label__1	Do not go here. It was a complete nightmare from start to finish. 4 hour wait time, no place to sit, overcrowded, people being herded like cattle with no care of HIPPA regulations. It was the worst medical experience of my life and I work as a medical provider.
__label__1	Going into this store I was excited to browse the sales.  I walked out within 10 minutes. This store has the worst customer service and the layout of the merchandise was in such a disarray I couldn't navigate through.  The 2 employees that were working did not care that a few customers were in the store as they openly complained about the sales racks they had to move and were quite frazzled by all the work they had.  Not one employee noticed I was wondering around and did not ask if I needed help or to even say hello.  This was the worst experience I have EVER had and will never return.
__label__1	Tried going in at 1a.m.  Doorman said VIP only.  I get the feeling that he was looking for a tip.  Please avoid garbage businesses like this.
__label__1	Had a blow out on the interstate and driver here because they were open. My van needed tires anyway so i went ahead and got all 4. HUGE MISTAKE driving less than 40 miles home i had 3 flat tires. Called the shop and was passed around and then hung up on. Once i called back the shop had closed fort the day. NEVER EVER go here for anything! You would better luck at the zoo letting the chimps put the tires on your car
__label__1	ok.. stay away..had diarrhea for days.. ordered sesame chicken asked if it was all white meet, they say yyess.. not.. it was chewy.. ordered $25. $$$ of food .thank god we had anti diarrhea on hand..
__label__1	member unlimite but you can not wash your car more than 3 times a week (owner or manager and stupid with clients).  I already had my member for more than 4 months, unlimited today when I get to wash my car the (stupid) man who was (not the usual) told me that my $ 19.99 member was canceled because I am a uber drive and my price and more expensive $ 44.99 / mo. Do you have a sign where you do not say anything about it and now you want to charge me double? Thank you stay with your business and good luck.
__label__1	"Very very very slow service. Many open seats and would not take us to a table till 18mins after our reservation.

Took 22 minutes to get a beer..."
__label__1	Food was ok but ruined by condescending guy behind the counter. And the discovery of 16 (!) county health violations. Won't be returning.
__label__1	Cockroaches!!! Ate here last night and toward the end of our dinner the biggest cockroach I have ever seen fell from the ceiling a few inches from our food. Soooooo disgusting...there must be tons. They need exterminators stat!
__label__1	Worst pizza I've ever had in my life.  We got the deep pan siciliana, it took 1-1/2 hrs. for delivery which was bad enough, the delivery guy didn't even apologize for being late and the pizza was almost uneatable...the bottom of the pizza was soaking wet!!! It looked like it was thrown together and not cooked enough = GROSS!  I wouldn't go here again if the pizza was free. HORRIBLE!
__label__1	"Potato soup that was chowder broth for $7? I think the cup must have been bigger than the saucer they called a ""bowl""."
__label__1	"If you want a five hour round c'mon out. There are no rangers. Just amateur hour here.

The golf course was in good shape but with no rangers to push slow golfers along it is a big miss"
__label__1	I would not eat there again . They couldn't get the simplest things right . Messed up my order twice and took way to long . By the time I got it everyone else had finished . They were even hesitant about giving me a complimentary side . They also sat us at a table that wasn't properly clean and had no silverware when they brought our food out so we also had to wait for that . Much better places in town .
__label__1	Super slow - bizarre how long drive thru takes. If you have an hour to kill great place. Joke.
__label__1	This hotel has seen better days.  You cannot reach the elevators after checking in without being accosted by someone selling time shares.  Outdated décor, and not particularly clean.  A truly bizarre courtyard sits in the middle of all of this, with no way to access it.  Stay elsewhere.
__label__1	Nastyyyyyyy. Worst customer service ever. Anytime you go it's bad. Rude on speaker. Can't count on register. Never gives a receipt with order. Today was the last time going ever. Hair in food ! Never have hair nets. This place needs to be shut down ASAP
__label__1	Amenities seem to be going down.  There has been staff turnover, cigarette smoke in the elevators, printer often doesn't work, gossip culture, religion-pushing concierge, casino access revoked (tunnel closed).
__label__1	Piss poor customer service.  Take your vehicle here if you want to spend whatever free time you may have calling them to figure out what's going on with your vehicle.
__label__1	Over priced store, over priced dive trips, rude owner, overall bad experience.  We purchased some equipment and had a problem with it.  Spoke with the owner and he was rude and no help.  I will never be back to this place!
__label__1	"Dont trust these fake reviews, came here to get an estimate. They did not take the time or courtesy to check my car on an estimate. They took 2 sec to say it will cost you thousands! without me explaining any detail on what bodypaint is needed. Racist/ Prejudice? Probably 

Do Not waste your time on this poor service, if they dont care if during the first impression, why would they care wheb they handle your car?"
__label__1	I come here often for business shipping and printing and often resolve to find a better place but never do because it's close.  This time I'm quitting them for good.  The shipping and printing staff is mostly incompetent (there are a few notable exceptions) waits are long, prices are high, and both staff and management seem indifferent to the problem.  I'd use Vista for printing (exceptional service, great prices) and anywhere else at all for shipping.
__label__1	Terrible service from the young employee taling the order. First off, I said my name and called me thr wrong nanme - Kevin(TWICE). When I went to pick up my order she asked me for my name (again) and then could not find my order and asked for which one (shocker). I also asked for no olives... had olives. She said I did not order it like that. Wont be coming back ever again.
__label__1	It took 20 minutes to get three bowls of ice cream.  I'm not exaggerating. During my wait, they emptied the garbage and carried three huge blue bags full of garbage right through the dining room. I would never go here again.
__label__1	Awful practices by salespeople. I had a salesperson come by my house gave me names of neighbors that were customers  (they are not I verified), and he knocked on my door not once at 2pm but again at 8pm. Many of my neighbors were hit twice by him some as late as 9pm. Shamless soliciting without a license might I ad. Bext time you are in my neighborhood I'll be calling the police! The only reason you got 1 star is because I could not post a review without one.
__label__1	"The food was okay - you may be better off at IHOP. Waitresses were friendly, but the kitchen was pretty swamped. Portions were a little small. The religious artifacts and signs all over the walls ensure that I won't be back, though.

Is that Fox News on the TV?"
__label__1	Refused to do tattoo after looking at one reference photo and without talking with the customer about their full idea. Clearly didn't want the business. I have been tattooed here before without issues by a different artist, so I'm left wondering what has changed. I have also recommended this shop countless times and that will now stop.
__label__1	This place lived up to the other yelp reviews. I ordered a chicken Caesar salad. Concerned that the chicken was not cooked, I threw the food away. All the lettuce was brown and old too. I would not return given food safety concerns. Too bad, location is really convenient to the boat pond in Sister Cities Park!
__label__1	I don't know who's in the store Sunday at 930 pm November 21st but why would they think it's acceptable to DRENCH the wings with over a cup of sauce, I order here a lot an never have they done me this wrong, I can literally not eat my wings
__label__1	I am an esthetician who took a leap of faith going to a nail salon for a lip wax bc it was convenient.  DO NOT GET WAXED HERE  THEY DOUBLE DIP !! If more people realized how unsanitary and illegal it is I think they'd be put of business.  When I said something to the lady she laughed at me ! I can only imagine what other unsanitary chosen they make for the other services they offer . Never again
__label__1	"Went out on a limb and tried their Nashville Hot Chicken Dog. It was... underwhelming. I was given the option of hot or mild, I chose hot. It was extremely dull flavor-wise. No heat, no zing, nothing. The pickle cream was fine, but couldn't salvage the dish as a whole.

The kicker is that this cost $10. No side, no drink, just a 3/10 hotdog for $10, which leads to a 1/5 experience."
__label__1	Ok we ordered a pastrami sandwich and the meat was hard to chew...disappointed then we ordered a sausage sandwich but it was a hotdog with a lot of sour mustard and kraut. I'm not sure what happened plus we ordered a knish but even tho the lady said ok one knish we never got it.  I wanted to like this place.
__label__1	Stay away if you have kids. The assistant manager is the rudest, most unprofessional person I have ever encountered, and she interacts with children in an inappropriate way.  Children are not welcome in this store, and you are likely to be verbally abused by management if you dare enter this store with a kid. Stay Away!!!
__label__1	HUGE waste of time and money. The office is extremely disorganized, practitioners have horrible empathy and bedside manners, and they lied to me about being able to take my insurance AND refill my medication I had been taking for years after they told me they could. They also sent me a huge bill that included a $60 drug test that I DID NOT CONSENT TO WHICH IS ILLEGAL. This place is a total joke and should be closed down.
__label__1	I know that from a $30 wash you should not expect a lot but if they tell you that they leave your car brand new then you expect that. Every time i come here there is always an issue, either they leave the most obvious trash on the floor of the car, they dont clean what I originally needed cleaned or like today they misplaced a cup holder mat which isn't cheap and dont even bother to apologize or let you know they just simply stay quiet and hope for the best. If you really like perfection in your car a few extra bucks can go a long way anywhere else.
__label__1	Office staff (billing) is horrible! Cannot stand to be questioned even though they consistently overbill & you have to submit for reimbursement once your claim is processed. They went as far as to involve the actual dentist in my billing matter despite the fact that I had been a paying client for almost 15 years!
__label__1	Great service, but stale/old food.  The chicken tasted like it had been cooked days ago, could not finish the meal and ended up throwing up.  After the first two bites, it tasted weird.  They are serving chicken that should have been thrown out days ago.  The service was the only thing that was good.  Shameful!!
__label__1	Wouldn't honor the check-in free glass of wine. The waitress just couldn't understand it despite me showing her my phone screen (which is what the directions say to do) and explaining how it is supposed to work. I thought she understood, said she'd talk to her manager, I say ok, but never brought my wine. Ok fine.. whatever. Then on top of that, the food was meh. And they are always out of empanadas!!!!
__label__1	The drinks are outrageously expensive. $15-20 for one cocktail. The service is awful. I have been there three times in the last two years and it always takes at least 30 minutes to get your cocktail made. They lock their front door and you sit outside and wait for someone to get you and they act weirded out to have to open the door. The have a 19% service fee added on that does NOT go to the servers tip. So sad these kind of businesses are taking over sweet little Boise.
__label__1	I was not impressed at all! Service was good and friendly but the ice cream was awful. Nothing tastes like what it was suppose to. The toppings were stale. The cookie at the bottom of my cup tasted awful. I got like 4 different toppings and I couldn't tell which was which because they all had no flavor or taste. Will not be back. Too expensive to taste like stale plastic.
__label__1	Terrible, wrong order three times in a row.  Even caught it on the third time they changed the order twice and still it was wrong.  I just want a bacon cheddar mcchicken with just bacon and cheddar. EVERY TIME I get chicken with lettuce and mayo.  Never again will I go here.
__label__1	Downright awful customer service. Arrived to order a green stripe pizza exactly how it's stated on the menu around 8:30pm, did not have a line or anything pending. When I received my pizza, the order completely wrong. When I went back to the employee who gave it to me to say that the order was wrong and the employee argued with me that it was correct until I took it back instead of wasting time on a conversation that wasn't going anywhere.. Will not be returning to this place.
__label__1	This place used to be good. They got a new Owner and now this place is not good. The ribs weren't fresh nothing was fresh.
__label__1	Food was TERRIBLE. Husband and I ordered burgers - both came out cold, yet completely overlooked. Fries were cold. They brought out my burger with the incorrect ingredients because they ran out of what I ordered - apparently the customer doesn't need to get what they ordered. Stay away.
__label__1	"Unfortunately, I have to update my review of China King Buffet. During my last visit, I discovered chicken feathers in my food! Yes, chicken feathers! I guess they must kill the chickens themselves and someone was a little lazy with the plucking. This completely grossed me out and I don't think I'll be returning. Definitely not as sanitary as I originally thought. Yuck!

Beware of feathers!"
__label__1	Whoever I spoke to on the phone was really rude. Called to start service with him - money wouldn't have been an issue at all - but before I could finish my sentence and ask a few questions, he was already interrupting me and being very rude.  I agree with the other post how this place doesn't want your business. There's a reason why he picks up **** for a living.
__label__1	Can't say much about the food because we didn't eat here. As a matter of fact we never got our drinks either because after 25 minutes of waiting for our drinks to come we finally left. The restaurant was not crowded and our pretentious little waiter doesn't know a thing about service let alone how to spell the word. The restaurant is very out dated & has a very Loveboat lounge look to it without Issac there to make your drinks.... Glad we took our business to a more deserving restaurant.
__label__1	whats the point of reviewing when chipotle don't care and do not respond. Worse restaurant in Reno area.
__label__1	Thought I would give this McDonalds more chances.  It has a great location, right off the expressway.  When I do go the parking lot it usually is empty but you have to wait in line or the drivethur and say hello I am here to get someone to take your order. The last couple times I have gone : trash and garbage bins full, have to send buyers back, order tea or a soda light ice and have sent those back also.  Today on my bag they took off the survey tag.....done with this one
__label__1	Bland, boring, below average. There are so many better places to eat Mexican/Tex Mex in Nashville, it's hard to understand why anyone would eat here on purpose more than once. Avoid.
__label__1	"Says ""Wendy's"" on the outside of the building?
I swear: this is not ""Wendy's"". 
Somebody call Dave Thomas!
---is Wendy's grubby dirty inside?
---are the burgers at Wendy's dry , hard and chewy?
---Are Wendy's staff overtly mean?  Yes: the staff here are mean to the customers! Most amazing thing I've ever seen.  
If you truly love Wendy's,  go find one.  It's not here."
__label__1	We have been here many times but with the recent expansion I am sad to report a very disappointed breakfast and service we were put in the new basement and it smelled musty also decreased service because of being so far from service I really hate when a decent place expands and forgets the customers who frequented there establishment for many years, Good By Blueplare there are way to many places to go that continue to respect there customers.
__label__1	"Their glass machine is down so I had to drive out to cool springs to get my glass their cutter is very 
Basic and cuts like a ruler so I'm unsure why or how their machine is down all the time but its definitely a sore when u need something fast"
__label__1	"Terrible.  Not even close to the Seasons it used to be.  My orders used to take 30min now it takes an hour and a half.  

Now they have implemented an $8.00 minimum order for delivery when their subs are all $7.99.

Like who the hell wants to order two sandwiches just to wait over an hour and a half for the food.

You just lost a customer."
__label__1	Walked in and packaged an item in a small envelope. I walked up to the counter when directed to and told the woman I'd like to overnight the envelope to which she very rudely told me I'd filled out the wrong label and needed to fill out a different one. I did that and returned to the counter after waiting in line. A different woman helped me this time and she was just as rude. Absolutely miserable human beings! The office was far from busy and every small task or simple question just seemed to exasperate them.
__label__1	Came here today and the restaurant was not that busy. The only person who did their job was the hostess who sat us down and gave us our menus. We sat there for over 15 minutes and never got any service so we left.
__label__1	"Never order from here. Chad who is the manager at night will not honor an order that was delivered by Uber. Chad states that the Uber driver stole my food. He did nothing but argue. Why would uber driver steal my food? Then he states this is ongoing problem with UBER. I highly doubt that as I use Uber all the time and don't have this problem. 
Poor
Customer service."
__label__1	Rebecka Hilvers charged me $630 to do my tax return and I am trying to get a hold of her to see if she did it or not. I am unable to get a hold of her. Please advise!
__label__1	Will never eat there again.  Live moving worm in my dessert and when sent back to the chef/owner Andrea sent waiter back to me to show me the live worm was on the mint.  Chef never made any compensation or personal apology.
__label__1	Worst Company ever! Heed my warning do not use this Company. Going on 2 years and my sunroom is still not completed! The company tells you when they are coming then never shows up and this is still happening 2 years later. FYI their prices are negotiable, I was told not to tell but do not settle with their first quote trust me you can get your sunroom for lessi would not have given the Company 1 star but you can not write a review without 1 star. I would have put negative 3 stars
__label__1	If you love to get the wrong order and a lower quality product than you get at most Dunkins, visit this location!  They have gotten it wrong since they opened and there is no hope of improvement in sight.
__label__1	If I could put a negative star I would. Do not rent from this management company!!!
__label__1	Way over rated and worse than Pat's. Tried them both the same day and easy to tell the difference. Meat sliced thicker, tougher and less of it. You'd think Whiz from the jar would be the same, but Geno's was runny. Don't know how they managed that.
__label__1	"This has always been a ""go to"" place since I discovered it a while back.  I would go out of my way to have lunch or bfast there when I could.  However I was surprised today to find that things have changed.  They now have a Bfast menu with about 6-7 items and they had a lunch menu with only THREE SANDWICHES (a cuban, a  veggie, and some other one).  I'm so disappointed.  I hope they change back.  This is off my list until they do."
__label__1	Very unprofessional. Cash only, no receipt. Anyone can pick car up with no proof of ownership. Makes up random price that is inconsistent with other price he gave other people.
__label__1	This place is disgusting & flavorless. I thought I'd give them a second chance but it was even worst the 2nd go round. I found a long hair in my quesadilla. I can't wait until chipotle opens up the street.
__label__1	"The WORST experience I've ever had at a bar. Like the other comments here, there's this random lady walking around FORCING people to take jello shots. When i say forcing... she will NOT let you go under any circumstance and force the shot into your mouth. The bar tender also didn't care at all that she was doing this and was rude. Do NOT come here
In addition, when i stepped away, the same lady asked my friends where i was and did a slanted eye motion (signaling asian), which is extremely racist and uncalled for."
__label__1	I was so disappointed in how rude the owner Mimi was to her customers... including myself.  I even watched her yell and threathen a man for petting her wiener dog!  I went in ready to spend money on books and jewelry and Mimi's serious attitude problem turned me off to spending any of my hard earned money in her store.  There is definitely a lot of dark energy in that store and unfortunately it comes from the owner.  Mimi, if you're reading this...you should seriously see a psychiatrist for your personality disorder.  They have medications that can help you.
__label__1	2 female Philadelphia natives decided to go out for dinner and drinks. Walked in to the establishment to multiple men playing pool and a room filled with only male patrons. Waitress was female. Not greeted by any employee, so we found a table and sat. And sat. And sat. And sat. Waitress walked by our table multiple times and failed to acknowledge our presence. Not impressed by any means. We left and went to Mccrossens and had a lovely dinner and fabulous drinks.
__label__1	I bought purple hair dye and it came out white and it turned up white in my hair. I do not recommend shopping here. My hair is now white.
__label__1	Nine months after suffering a major hospitalization on my trip, they keep asking every two months for more meaningless documentation like the recent request for the entry and exit stamps on my passport. They are not to be trusted. They are fundamentally unreliable.
__label__1	Today, when I told the young woman working  what I needed and then she proceeded to try to show me what she thought I needed, I corrected her. Thanks but no thanks for the help and the attitude, guys. Frankly, I don't appreciate being treated like an idiot. Thanks for the help previously. Good luck going forward.
__label__1	You absolutely suck. We have an order over 50 dollars and screw up the order and you can't deliver the missing food?  Where is your customer service, or do you just not believe in such things? Marino's would have given the missing  food to us free and delivered the food.  Hmmmm...just sayin..I wonder why...   You then gave my friend an attitude about your scree up???   Unbelievable!!!
__label__1	This has been the worst experience I ever had trying to get an account set-up for oil delivery. The communication is simply horrible. I usually never leave reviews because if I am dissatisfied with service I send a letter or email to the company. For a family-owned company that's been in business for 91 years, I thought I would get better and prompt service. Comminucation is everything in business whether it's wriiten or verbal. There are so many other places I can get an account set-up for oil delivery. I do not recommend  Wilson at all!
__label__1	Worst service ever! If I could give zero stars O would. They are scam artists!  They are charging us for no work done!!
__label__1	"Gym is nice, pool is nice, office is nice, model apartment they show is nice, everything else is horrible. Things are always breaking in the apartment. They charge you so much extra for electricity. The ""gates"" never work and are always open. It's not student housing so don't expect to live with other students. No remodels are done for the apartment so they're ugly."
__label__1	I placed an online order for pickup at 1215p I arrived at 1225p and didn't get my order until 1245p.  What is the point of ordering ahead if I still have to wait 20 minutes.  I didn't even get my receipt, I got someone else's receipt.  They have me a free drink.  Not impressed.
__label__1	Lipstick on a Pig.  The common areas look very nice, but rooms are horrible.  My room smelled like mold and stale beer.  The appointments were old and worn and there wasn't even a refrigerator.
__label__1	Don't waste your money! I went in with what I was concerned might be a broken arm. The elderly doctor took one look at me & told me that there was nothing he could do for me & he was sure I didn't have a broken bone, but that if I really felt it necessary they could take an xray. He offered no guidance at all & didn't even come back in to discuss the results with me. The worst beside manner I've ever encountered!
__label__1	I called to order takeout and 3 times in a row I was hung up on. I was asked to wait on hold which was reasonable but after a couple minutes they hung up the phone. After 3 times of this I gave up. They clearly don't care about customer service.
__label__1	The service is slow. After waiting patiently for 40 minutes, I asked the staff how much more we have to wait for our food and apparently they have not started it yet. My husband and I decided not to wait and left the resto. It's really an unpleasant experience. I love your burgers but after this happens so often that we don't want to go back.
__label__1	First the service is subpar at best. The reason for the one star was due to the overall uncleanliness of tge restaurant and the overall health standards of this location not to mention my Turkey Burger taste like presses cardboard. The seats all had trash on them and I was handed a towel to dry my seat. The dirt on the towel showed they don't clean them regularly. I left the restaurant still hungry and that was the main goal, was to eat .......smh!!!
__label__1	The staff was unfriendly and flustered. The location was hard to find and the walk from the parking lot was extremely long. We found a hair in our entree and the manager offered us 4oz. Glass of wine...what??? The only redeeming quality was the bartender Chris. I would NEVER go back.
__label__1	Terrible management terrible food. Nice location. Maybe drinks there but I will never eat there again.
__label__1	We placed an online order for delivery.  After 25 minutes, I received a call saying that they were too busy to complete my order and it would be cancelled.  The online tracker showed that an employee was making the pizza.  If they are unable to complete orders they should shut down the online ordering or call immediately.
__label__1	If I could give 0 stars I would. First off they charged me for 10 wings and I only received 6, then they put lamb on my chicken gyro. I call and then they messed up the order and the guy tells me the order was correct. DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS PLACE. IT WILL UPSET YOUR STOMACH
__label__1	"I read the first review by ""fabian"" that pizza is fabulous. ..are u kidding me ...maybe hes the owner...the pizza is terrible. ...tastless,soggy,  ive had store bought that tastes better...do yourself a favor go down the road to East Coast Pizza, Cafe Italia , Cappy's and on and on......anywhere but here !!!"
__label__1	"I live just a few miles from this ""local attraction"", but I feel the responsibility to warn anyone planning to pay a visit: This place is a tourist trap. Rubbery, overcooked  food, flat champagne, terrible service.  You won't find any locals dining here. Peddler's Village is beautiful, but Cock 'n Bull is no representation of what the village has to offer.  Instead, I'd highly recommend visiting Earl's Bucks County (excellent food with the best bar scene in Bucks County) or Caleb's American Kitchen (superb cuisine with the convenience of BYOB)."
__label__1	Carísimo, mucha gente, pocas flores, algunas en malas condiciones. Es mucho más el comercio que el show en si. Faktan más materiales nobles en los arreglos. Totalmente decepcionada :(
__label__1	Pizano's was by far the worst restaurant that me and my girlfriend have never ever done that I will never recommend anybody to go to at that restaurant or ever go back to it. They have the most fake worst Italian food I've ever had in my whole life a Stromboli suck it had no cheese in it and had to fake Hungry Howies meat in it it was awful
__label__1	I used them a couple of times for painting, their work was good, if a little expensive. Recently booked them for a time sensitive job turning around a rental unit. A week and a half before the start date for the project they responded to my check in that they were no longer available. That they had a booked a different job during the time I had reserved with them. Were they even going to tell me? Completely unacceptable. What is the point of booking a time if they can't even stick to it? Not recommended.
__label__1	Big fat zero for this place. We pulled in at 10:45 pm and the employees turned out the lights. We got out of the car and said did they really just turn out the lights?? I could see them laughing as if it was so hilarious to turn away customers. Especially customers who post reviews on Yelp, Trip Advisor, Twitter, and FB. We checked the door for the hours which said open until 11pm. Um, no...open until paying customers pull in at 10:45. Take your business elsewhere, we sure did.
__label__1	Called for a cab at the airport. They told me to walk around and look for one. I couldn't get a cab to the car rental door. What a joke. I had to call Orange Cab which had no problem picking me up. Sad because I used them to get here originally. Just shows how some people don't care.
__label__1	"Originally, I came here to drop off a car so I thought I'd return since my first experience went so well.

Now I understand all the poor reviews. The gentleman who ""assisted"" me today made no effort to hide his apathy. He seemed bothered by me and my questions. Never again."
__label__1	"Absolutely the worst. Only posting this complaint to vent since there's really no other alternative--it's not like I can pick which cable company to go with. I'm stuck with these inept morons. WiFi, DVR, pixilation/lost signals, customer service & pricing are all 1-star. They're the worst in every category in every way and I have no choice. I'm stuck with them.

This is what hell is like. Pure hell."
__label__1	My order was simple the buy 2 for $5.99 each. It was just a pizza and cheesy bread. I ordered the cheesy bread with jalapeños and bacon. The cheesy bread just came plain! Also my pizza was not cut, and all the toppings were not evenly spread throughout pizza!! I even gave the guy a good tip and they did me dirty! Won't ever order form this place again!!!!!
__label__1	OMG, you should believe why this restaurant only 3 stars.  Bad service, line waiting too long, food order take forever. I'm very easy to eat but trust me if I can give negative point for this restaurant. Foods  & too much MSG, no flavor. Never never think about to come back
__label__1	I usually love checkers but this one was horrible! Rude workers who look like they hate their job. My burger had such a soggy bun that it was like mush.. They said they were out of lettuce and the apple pie had no apple in it! Just stay away from this place!
__label__1	The waiter/employee service here is unacceptable. Empty restaurant, The waiters and employees were drinking Starbucks staring at the their cell phones, not paying attention to the guests. We had to go up and find the waiter to order drinks/ food. We came for lunch and it took over 50 minutes for the food to arrive. The waiter barely came to our table and had an attitude. The waiter spilled ketchup all over one of our guests.  The food is very good, but the service ruined our meal. Also the bathrooms are supposedly closed at the restaurant making guests go to the hotel next door for some reason.
__label__1	This USE to be (25 yrs ago) the go to chinese take-out place. Now it's the last resort!! Extremely overpriced greasy salty food. If I could give it a zero I would. Stay away
__label__1	Hate the food. Hate the atmosphere and the wait staff is inattentive and rude. It's like eating a Banquet meal except ten times more expensive, literally. Save yourself from the bad food and just go to Mafiosas or Anything else in the neighborhood instead. Your taste buds and your wallet will thank you!!
__label__1	Just tied to check in $950/night room.  Hotel front desk staff is very rude and unwelcoming.   We did not get the room we reserved.  We are still waiting to check in at 2:45 ...   Now what to expect.    Got into my room.  We requested a non-pool area room.  We got room 193x over the pool.  (Lots of kids and ping ping table noise).   Honestly a disaster to have put so much effort and money $950/night and have this poor service and noisy room.   We are celebrating our anniversary and a total failure by this property management
__label__1	This place smells terrible. I'm pretty sure it's just full of mold or something equally gross. Our server was not very friendly at all. I haven't been to a TGI Fridays in a long time and coming here today reminds me why. If you're going to sell overpriced entrees please try to keep your restaurant clean.
__label__1	Love this place at first. (I used to go to West Chester location and then Ardmore after). There loaded nachos was unreal. Good beer good food until 1 year ago when the menu started to change. I think they changed the menu 3 times already and the portion keeps getting smaller and smaller. Sorry iron hill I will never come back here again because you are not the restaurant that I used to know
__label__1	first off, nobody here speaks English and it is very hard to understand what you're supposed to do and what they are telling you. I came in for a full body massage and a man led me back to a room. he massaged me very very hard and kept leaving the room to drink soda (heard him open a can) he also was coughing and snorting mucus the whole time. It was terrible and I will not be returning.
__label__1	Walked in the door and the counter person said it would be an hour and a half wait because of a to go order of 31 pizzas. Cannot tell you about the food quality, but they certainly don't want to attract business. Would've been easier to work our order in, but oh well. I don't recommend just because of the service.
__label__1	"Egg roll boring and not flavorful
Garlic chicken and vegetable greesy, chicken was tiny, vegetables not fresh. Overall not good would not recommend."
__label__1	Ambushed by aggressive gate agents looking to capitalize on baggage fees... poor execution and delivery.
__label__1	Horrible customer service!  Office is filled with arrogant elitists that will do anything to screw you.  DO NOT RENT HERE!!
__label__1	"I went through the drive thru, ordered  a chicken ranch BLT, grilled & with
NO lettuce or tomato.
When I got home much to my surprise, I had a ranch BLT, Crispy & loaded
with lettuce & tomato.
I usually go to the Mc Donalds at Florida ave. & Bird St.  My order there is always
correct. I will never go back to this restaurant, they just do not have their act together."
__label__1	The worst food I've had in a long time... Extremely disappointed, but this place has potential. The flavors were great, but the chicken in the Biryani was rubbery chunks of meat that had been overheated one too many times... If the food quality was fresher, this place could do so much better.. For the high prices, this place definitely needs to bring up its quality standards, especially for being located in Franklin. Embarrassing that they would even serve such low quality food!
__label__1	I would like to know who runs this particular Supercuts? Because if you have people working their that don't know what they're doing that's a problem!
__label__1	Do not rent here if you actually want things done. You can call maintenance everyday for a week and they still will do nothing. There is literally a board on my porch that is broken, my friend (and myself) tripped over it I literally injured myself, but yet they still have not fixed it! Surprise surprise. Very unreliable.
__label__1	This place is a rip off and smells like urine. The bartender changed her prices after each beer. I almost died from infection in the rest room
__label__1	Open til 11? Must be 11 in the upside down cuz this location is always closed. Literally have come here 4 different times in the past 2 months and it's always closed. Hours listed are the same as everywhere else. So I take it management here do whatever they want.
__label__1	I have eaten here before and really enjoyed it.  Today we waited 45 minutes just for the appetizers.  Been way over an hour. still don't have our food.  We keep asking  the waitress and she keeps saying it's the kitchen.  Got a table full of VERY unhappy people here.  We won't be back.
__label__1	This is the worst dry cleaner in tampa bay.  Expensive, miss return deadlines, leave little white stains on clothes, and worst of all they permanently affixed a bar code label in each item i left there!  I can't take it off, and have no plans of returning.  Thanks for a terrible experience.  Jerks.
__label__1	Just ordered from there and not happy at all with my food! I ordered egg foo young shrimp with lobster sauce, the egg foo young had huge pieces of onions in it and lettuce the shrimp with lobster sauce was very bland and watered down with lights a lot of egg whites the delivery man was rude and made me give him a tip in order to receive my food will never ever order from there again sadly disappointed
__label__1	VERY BAD SERVICE. See us done eating but didn't clean the tables and didn't even ask if we have cake in the fridge. VERY BAD SERVICE
__label__1	We're we're excited to try this place.  Sat there for 30 minutes and finally got our water.  Did not take our order.  Very disappointed.  Worst service ever. Too bad; they just lost some good customers .  Don't go here!
__label__1	"Most disgusting burrito I've ever had. I really wanted to ask for my money back, but I didn't want to be ""that customer"" so we just asked for our check within 10 minutes of getting food and left. Praying I don't get food poisoning from the 5 bites I took. Jesus take the wheel"
__label__1	"Terrible service. Call in for a box of coffee. When I got
there they forgot about it. Then they started taking other others and forgot about me again. I will never visit them again."
__label__1	I placed an online order today at 6:33 pm for delivery, and I didn't receive my order until almost 4 hours later. who delivers an an order almost 4 hours later and expects the person to take it. why was my ticket for my order printed almost 3 hours after I ordered? literally the worst pizza shop in this area
__label__1	Merlice has to be the worst server that I have ever had the displeasure of serving me. She should be fired for her total lack of customer service.
__label__1	Have been here 3 diff times over the years and every time I'm more disappointed. Slow service, terrible food example our flatbread. And unsanitary, slow service, had to ask for things multiple times. Bloody Mary was literally tomato juice  and vodka until I asked for Worcestershire to add to it. A lunchable pizza I made when I was 8 could've been better than that.
__label__1	"We dined here twice during a conference across the bridge. The first lunch was very, very slow. The food was tasty though. We went back the next day for sushi and waiter was extremely rude. He ""warned us"" that we should order quickly. Evasive there's a conference with ""demanding"" attendees. I kindly told him we were part of that ""demanding"" group. Again, food was good but there was also a very bad smell in the restaurant."
__label__1	I'll keep it short - THIS LOCATION IS BRUTAL!  Something has happened at this location.  Last 3 visits in a row and they have forgotten something from our order.  Forced to drive back to pick up missing item. No sorry - they just stare at you.  They just don't care anymore. NEVER AGAIN!
__label__1	Disgusting. Will never go back.  Noodles dried out was probably sitting out all day.  Freshly prepared my ass.....food was horrible.
__label__1	"Under no circumstances should you come into this DuDos. Only use the drive through. I waited 20 minutes as the only customer inside for two simple sandwiches. Either the owner of this location needs to be more hands on or the training of talent needs to be better managed. 

Terrible terrible example of a DuDos."
__label__1	I really regret not just eating at the hostel on this day.  No refills on fountain sodas?!  REALLY!?  All I got was scrambled eggs and sausage and it took about 482934837 years to come out.  Maybe I would have enjoyed it more if I'd gotten pancakes, but eh.  It still would have taken 482934837 years to come out and I still would have gotten more and more cranky waiting.
__label__1	Not sure what previous reviewers ate but starting at the salsa and working its way down to our main dish, the food was horrible. Everything was bland and that was NOT Mexican rice! We went for lunch so there was no wait and everyone was courteous but the food left this Mexican longing for some real tacos.
__label__1	Customer service is the pits, the airport shuttle never arrived, and upon arrival they couldn't find my car, and lost someone's keys to their car, nevvvvvvver again will I use this service! Unorganized and unprofessional
__label__1	So incredibly dissapointed. Booked months in advance to celebrate my birthday dinner there. We were shown to a table so tiny there was barely room for the wine glasses. it was so dark we had to request extra candles to read the menu. I ordered the shrimp which they did not mention came withe heads on and beady little eyes starting at me. had to send it back and fight nausea. My boyfriend ordered pizza which was merely soso. The place is really overpriced for what you get. Dont believe the hype on this place. Will not go back.
__label__1	This Cosi has, by far, the most disgusting bathrooms I have ever seen in my life. I've been to dive bars with cleaner bathrooms. It looked and smelled like they hadn't been cleaned in a month. If they can't keep their restrooms clean, I don't even want to see what the kitchens look like.
__label__1	made an appointment the week before. was unable to reach them again to confirm. they're not close to my house and it required changing my work schedule to go, so i called many times and could never get anyone on the phone but the phone (a cell number) sometimes only rang once or twice - meaning someone was choosing to not answer those times. i texted & nothing. so i went there anyhow the morning they were scheduled to work on my car and honked and knocked and called as the sign at their door said - and nothing. a really bizarre and frustrating waste of my time.
__label__1	Went there today for the first time and was very disappointed, we asked for a hot pastrami on a bagel and they gave us burnt pumpernickel toast and we wanted a bagel sandwich awful experience, we also ordered a dozen bagels and it was the first time we didn't get a baker's dozen, will never go back there again
__label__1	"If I could give no stars or negative I would. They have stolen my deposit!

We had movers scheduled and no one ever showed up. We never received a call or anything, we never even received a call from anyone with a time frame that they would be coming. I have been trying to get a hold of someone to get my deposit back but have yet to be able to reach any one. So as of now they have stolen my deposit without providing the contracted services."
__label__1	If I could give this store minus stars I would! The worst customer service ever! First we were given the wrong information and then could not get any help from them to fix it. No one ever returns calls. They were very rude!!! We are stuck with them but hope no one else is tricked by them! Can't wait to be able to switch from Sprint.
__label__1	This alley needs some SERIOUS renovating. The only food is snacks from vending machines. It looks like there was a restaurant but looks like it hasn't been open for months. No music. The fans look like they're about to fall out of the ceiling. It is so creepy inside since there is about 10 lights to light up the entire alley. The technology is ancient. If I wasn't here for an event I would not come near this place. Find somewhere else to go until this place is updated.
__label__1	"Get ready for scalding hot water in the men's room sink! I literally got 1st degree burns as there wasn't any cold water, zero. Only the lever for hot. Yes, only one handle. 
I couldn't locate a manager so I left info on the survey. I received a form email reply and no respect. 
Food was good, but cold.
Server was nice, but overwhelmed with a huge section. 
Bottomless sides took literally half an hour to refill each time.
DO NOT dine at this location. They just don't care."
__label__1	I attempted to go to this location on 7-20-16 for a full set at 6:30ish but had to make an appointment for today at 11 am.  They were prompt but that is where the satisfaction ends.  My nails are too thick, too long and the French manicure is uneven.  I will not be back.
__label__1	"So I was excited to have the Shrimp Chow Fun (Never order shrimp, especially during tough times bc despite the 'cockroaches of the ocean' being incredibly abundant AND currently inexpensive; thes kind of spots will rob you) until I opened the lid.

The shrimp were the size of a quarter. And the noodles were all clumped. The flavor was so-so.

STEER CLEARLY AWAY."
__label__1	Horrible. Cut my cuticles.they were in such a hurry, and rough, I changed my mind on the pedi I had told them I wanted and just got a fill. I will never go back here, and if I were you I'd choose another salon out of the million choices.
__label__1	Unreal gougers. Twenty to thirty percent higher than other places. Never will go again.
__label__1	Ordered fish.  My first bite told me that it was overcooked.  I informed the waiter, who was reluctant to take it back.  He did.  20 minutes later, no replacement.  I asked the waiter about my fish.  He said they weren't going to remake it.  Said 'That is just the way we make it.  If you didn't like it the first time, you aren't going to like it the 2nd time'.  Said he would take it off the bill.  I later discovered that our waiter was the owner.  Will not be back.  Recommend that you don't go either.
__label__1	I did not care for the smell of this place. While waiting the smell got so bad my wife and I walked out. The smell was a mix between bad seafood and a weird combination of spices. Not normal seafood smells.
__label__1	"This antique mall does have some decent merchandise but if you do not pay cash you will be fingerprinted along with your signature and I.D. with any credit card purchase.
Also if you are a person of color you will NOT be treated well here! If a white person brings in a backpack it's fine but if anyone brown does, they will be asked to keep their bag on a chair by the front door.
The owners are racist Trump supporters. They even have one dealer that sells Nazi memorabilia. Unacceptable. 
Please don't spend your money here if you have any integrity."
__label__1	"How do you mess up an order for a ""plain bagel and cream cheese""?

Since when did ""Plain Cream Cheese"" sound like ""Avacado""?

Best part: I wish I could say they gave me someone else's order, but I was the ONLY CUSTOMER in the shop, so ..."
__label__1	"BEWARE with this sneaky dentist!!!
Made appointment for check up and cleaning. At the end of check up, he charged me quite big amount of money, I asked why I had to pay cash, he told me because that's HOW my insurance works, I told him it never happened before, I never had to pay full amount and got reimbursement from the insurance company.
Turned out he is NOT in network with my insurance but he never told me that from the beginning. Sneaky guy!!! When I told him I had no cash with me, he turned to be very nasty."
__label__1	SSM has so many problems.  Needs new leadership.  U have other choices.  Go where u get a good well trained Dr and reasonable rates.  SSM needs to reorganize, and get new management.
__label__1	The tasting room is a nice space but their tasting is WAY over priced.  $10 for 6-10 samples.  Try Sand Castle Winery for a better tasting experience.  It's half the price and twice the samples.
__label__1	This is the most ghetto, unorganized, unprofessional ass place to eat. I had never eaten at this location and called my order in. When I got there 30 minutes later I had to wait and additional 20 minutes just for the cashier to tell me that my order wasn't even started. Wasted my lunch break. Not to mention a drug dealer came into the location aggressively looking for the cook. Smh trash
__label__1	Spilled my shot as I was tipping the bartender. Got napkins cleaned it up and then had to pay for a new one. So your friends drink for free but a paying customer has to pay for something they clearly didn't have.
__label__1	"RUDE staff, DIRTY seating area, OK food, NO existence of service. You would not find anyone eating here if they were not the only seatdown restaurant in Terminal D. I would not even want to eat here for Free.

Stay Away from this place. I am a frequent flyer and this is the worst Terminal restaurant in the continental US."
__label__1	"DO NOT ENTER!

We've all been to greasy spoon restaurants and we all have our favorites among them but Dawn's is definitely not in the discussion.
Sticky floors, sticky tables, non-chalant service, and inedible food. Dawn's is a place to avoid all together.

The prices are ok if the food was edible but with what I got I wouldn't even take it for free."
__label__1	Filthiest store I've ever been in. I even saw a rat scurry behind the register over where they make the food one time. Totally gross! The health department should shut this gross place down. The manager is always trying to sell you something and it's really annoying. Plus she has her subordinates constantly trying to sell stuff. Totally annoying and filthy store!
__label__1	If couldn't get right had a name it would be this location. It's always something and that something makes me hate Wendy's. This location always has a different crew and they can never get an order correct on the first and sometimes 2nd try. (Even on a mobile order, where it is spelled out for them!) The customer service is always lacking. Do not expect an apology after a mistake on their end either.
__label__1	This is the worst bank ever. They don't have a 24 hour hotline so you have to wait until the next business day. They will cut your card off over $50 purchases and won't call and tell you, and your card will randomly not work and they won't even know why it's not working themselves please stay away ! I'm closing my account today.
__label__1	"The other review is a year old and NOTHING has changed. It is still the same hateful rude man and the same hateful rude actions. My friend has a hearing problem so she kept asking him to repeat himself and that enraged him that much more. No ""thank you""!   He must own the franchise. Why would they keep him around?"
__label__1	After a hectic month, I finally had time to get my nails done. I went for the gel so I didn't have to worry about the manicure chipping or peeling quickly... or so I thought. The lady who did my nails was very sloppy, and even filed my nails AFTER she put the last layers of polish on my nails. Less than 4 hours later, my nail that she filed peeled after washings my hands. Complete waste of time and money. Plus, the light box where you put your hands was filthy. Highly recommend avoiding this place.
__label__1	"The internet itself is great, the issue is the customer service and billing issues.  I signed up for the $79.99 package five months ago and the first bill was $124.99.  I've spent countless hours online and on phone calls over the last five months and the billing issues have not been fixed.  From my experience, this appears to be fraudulent billing practices and my next step is to submit a complaint to the FCC.  

Stay far away from Fios if you have a choice."
__label__1	Ive been coming here for years and recently the blonde hair and heavy set hostesses were so rude to me. I was really disappointed because I really love this place but now I have a really bad taste in my mouth.
__label__1	The prices say it is gourmet pizza, however, the quality is equivalent to little Caesars pizza....
__label__1	Wow was this bad. Uncooked chicken. No peanut sauce served with chicken satay. 2 hour long wait for food. Manager didn't seem to care. I have been here before tim his past experience but will not be going again. Embarrassing evening for this restaurant.
__label__1	What's happened to America mom and pop pizza shops will always be better then production pizza this place is a joke !!!!!
__label__1	This place from just a cleanliness standpoint should be looked into by the health department. The platter my food was served on was absolutely filthy as were all the others they had. Since my food was wrapped I tried one bite before it was finished by the trash can. And absolute terrible place. Dirty dirty dirty yuck
__label__1	Took about an hour just to make 6 tacos 1 burrito and 2 servings of French fries like...... wtf how tf do you even take an hour just to make this shit. Don't recommend this shitting place
__label__1	"This Taco Bell is the worst in the game. Every time I go there they are out of something or ""machinery"" is down. They don't serve Gorditas and when I tried to get a chulupa they were ""Cleaning the fryer"" so they couldn't serve me one. The place looks nice enough but the employees and the service are definitely lacking."
__label__1	One of the worst restaurants in spring hill! Our waitress was rude and was nowhere to be found through our entire meal. The food was mediocre and expensive..really you upcharge for fries? And cheese on a cheeseburger? And a side of blue cheese for wings after they were offered to us? The restaurant was small and filled with waitresses and still we had terrible service! I will not recommend you go here unless you like to be treated like garbage and like paying for eh food.
__label__1	"They do not serve cooked food, pricey. 

The pictures they have are VERY MISLEADING. 

Not worth the trip."
__label__1	"Worst nail salons I've ever been to. I left theee almost 2 hours ago, got in the shower and my whole big toe nail is half covered in polish. My nails are super thick, her staff is rude. I literally sat in n the chair while a ""regular"" customer came in and demanded they fix her nails ""because I got a wedding in a couple hours."" So they left me in the char for 30 minutes while they catered to her."
__label__1	The worst!!!!! For 2.5 hours they assured me my pizza was on its way. Only to tell me the last time I called them that they don't deliver to my neighborhood. That's information that would have been useful to me when I first called!!!!! You suck!
__label__1	My friend was having a medical crisis when he got a severe case of hypoglycemia, and after explaining the situation to four different employees and showing them his insulin pump, they rudely denied his request to cut the line and pay extra money to get a soda. They were super naive and insensitive, also the food is overpriced anyway. If you're looking for a good Mexican food spot in IV, go to Super Cucas or Rosarito.
__label__1	Double charge on my Credit Card!!! Have called many times, many emails sent, no response!!! Bad service, no customer service at all!!! Better to walk then take their service!!!!!!!
__label__1	"I would give a zero if I could. Quick to take your money, don't answer the phone when something is wrong. It took over a month for my order to come. On the day of anticipated arrival, tracking said, ""delivered"" when nothing was actually delivered. I followed up with Fed Ex and the driver ""accidentally"" put that status update and is supposedly coming back tomorrow. Never again!"
__label__1	I tried to order the half and half under the salad/burrito. Apparently they didn't have it at all. So instead of telling me that they didn't have it. They just created a order off the menu and told me I ordered it. Very rude. They my husband got a burrito and I got to salads unreal. They could cooked me something else. I say at least my least my husband had dinner. I had a salad with no protein. So I didn't have dinner thanks to Sharky's.
__label__1	"Zero stars. Stood in ""line"" no one in front of me. Two people came in behind me and were served first. Really?!!  Avoid at all cost!!!!  They suck!!!!"
__label__1	Absolutely disgusting service. The service is horrible and the people are incredibly rude. I will never even think about going here again. Trashy dresses, horrible service, not worth it.
__label__1	"Remove the ability to check in online? Genius!

Not allowing the registration of a NV dealer bought travel trailer to be done electronically (even though it doesn't require proof of insurance or smog)?  Genius!

Unpleasant snarky government employees? Check!

Dirty bathrooms? Check!

This place has it all! And by all I mean that it is literally hell on earth. If you're reading this review in 2018, I'm probably still waiting at this DMV."
__label__1	Outrageous. 20 people in line. Three employees sitting at computers and socializing. ONE teller at the window!!! ONE!!! One working the drive through!!! I would fire everyone in here except those two working, that includes the lazy manager playing computer games!
__label__1	Was a no show, and disappeared days before the event. I spent months coordinating a menu for my father's birthday celebration and even signed a contract. I kept having to chase chef Gabe for responses throughout the entire process. I was so disappointed to tell my family that I haven't heard from him after all we planned. Unbelievable.
__label__1	BEWARE they take down bad reviews and they serve under cook raw dough beware ordering pizza or garlic knots also the buffalo wings are disgusting and taste like they just came out of the freezer or something GROSS FOOD and RUDE PEOPLE
__label__1	My husband and I recently tried Zolo's for dinner.  I do not recommend this recommend this restaurant.  From the start, the experience was bad.  When we entered the restaurant, the hostess was sitting on the bench inside and lazily got up and got us seated.  The food was terrible.  It lacked flavor, was lukewarm, and was overpriced.  It was a real disappointment.
__label__1	Be aware - Chicken -YES, Breakfast - NO. McDonald's is much cheaper. I come here all the time to do laundry and occasionally try the food. The sausage/egg patty biscuit is $6.00 and tastes like cardboard. They did slap some cheese on there, but it was as cold as the fridge and they looked at me strangely when I asked them to heat it for ten seconds to please melt the cheese. NOT worth the cost. The biscuit is kind of doughy too.
__label__1	Took an hour wait on a Monday morning. Of course it was the morning after a Cubs game, I get that. Got seated, server brought us silverware and haven't seen her for 10 minutes. People next to us have ate and are waiting on their check. 15 minutes later we finally get to order and the other people get to leave. Well we got here at 10 and we may make it out of here before they close. Food wasn't great but not the best. I won't be back.
__label__1	The cheesesteaks are gross and the mozzarella sticks are ugh. The decency of the pizza depends on the day. The wings are ok.
__label__1	"Okay....... so perhaps you are busy right now.... but with three employees at the front counter area and in five minutes NO ONE minimally says ""good morning"" or ""we will be right with you""?!?!  Really?  I expect much better service from Starbucks.  Really sad...."
__label__1	Don't waste your time to eat. Horrible service. Great views at sunset but what a mess.  Totally disorganized for bar food.  I would avoid this place.   They give you silver ware in a napkin with just a fork.  Said they stopped issuing knives to the public.  Feel free to use your fingers.  I recommend you find somewhere else to eat if your hungry. What a dump.    If you don't speak English it's a great spot.
__label__1	This place was simply not good..... It looks cute and quaint from the outside. But from the moment we walked in, everything changed. I can only hope I don't get sick. I ended up ordering a Sirloin Steak and it was good. But that's the best I can say!!
__label__1	"I love cheesesteaks and was excited to see Genos in the Philadelphia airport at dinner time. To be honest, this is my first Geno's experience -- I have made a point of going to Pats when I visit Philly...

One star is generous for the truly awful sandwich I was served. It smelled of old grease and tasted nothing like the cheesy beefy goodness I was looking for. 

My advise is steer clear of this place. I don't know about other locations, but my suspicion is they are likely the same. Very bad!!!!"
__label__1	"The manager just threatened to call the cops on a group of us because we were all talking in a room and waiting to go out for the 4th of July and it was completely uncalled for without any other kind of warning. The ""manager"" on the night of 07/03/16 was rude and aggressive."
__label__1	I don't know how the braid shop is still in business. I had twists done they were awful. The braider didn't clean up  the braids after she was done. The owner never did come in the salon! Just awful waste of money and time!!
__label__1	Ahhhh I hate to do this but my third attempt and just nothing is for me. ;( I wanted to leave an honest review for those that are from the South and crave a Vegan twist; this isn't it.
__label__1	If I could give less than one star I would give negative. These incompetent idiots didn't show up and said they had no record of our reservation even though we called just a few hours before. DO NOT USE THESE CLOWNS!  I hope Uber kills them dead!
__label__1	I used to love this place. The new owners are not that friendly but their daytime laundry guy is extremely rude and not helpful at all. Also I don't appreciate the passive aggressive messages they leave on the machine if you leave your clothes in longer than 5 minutes. I get it but most of their machines are broken which is why they make a huge deal out of customers leaving their clothes in the machine unattended for a few minutes. They need to fix their machines! And please hire a friendly staff.
__label__1	First off the bathroom smell like dirty seafood which almost took away my appetite to start with we order the king crab and lobster tacos there was hardly any meat in the king crab and considering that it was more expensive than the 3 pounds of a different kind of crab you would think that there would've been plenty of meat My lobster tacos was over an under cooked but the next two days hunched over the toilet so disappointed
__label__1	I got an 80 minute massage which turned out to be 60 minutes long. The massage therapist took me back in the room at 11, didn't come back in the room till 11:15. The room was cold, the massage was terrible. The massage ended at 12:15. The manager was suppose to call me and she never did. I will never be going back.
__label__1	Lindsey was one of the least genuine customer service people I've ever spoken with. Lost my wallet and just wanted to give my number in case it was found and she made me feel like a nuisance. Also totally cut me off saying it was my responsibility to look for my wallet. It was a really memorable experience. No empathy, no understanding, no concern. Seems like she might make a career change to telemarketing and do very well.
__label__1	"Terrible! The service is awful and rude staff. The fish i ordered was wrong and they refused to take it back or take it off of the check. The waitress said all she could give me is rice to make up for the mistake but wouldn't give me any other dish or fix the dish i ordered. She just said ""that's what you order"" and got mad when i explained that it was wrong. Will never return here to have low quality food and the wrong order!"
__label__1	"Do not ever go here. I spent $25 on multiple shirts and all of the collars were still dirty and two of the shirts I had just purchased one month ago. The gentleman that was at the counter said the shirts are all old- nothing will ever take away the stains and I will not even try again. This is the first time I have gone to a drycleaner where they haven't even tried again especially for a new customer 

For first time customer - poor QA, poor customer service, and poor cleaning service!"
__label__1	"The hotel has been fine when I have stayed there. The proximity to UofA is amazing and great for people not wanting to drive once in Tucson. 
Their reservation policy for 2018 graduation is unreasonable and shows what the heart of the owners looks like. If you could cancel a month ahead, the room would be sold, no problem. They have a no-refund policy 48 hours after you make your booking. So, BEWARE!!! Make sure your student is going to be walking or else you'll be out $316. This shows the ugly side of capitalism."
__label__1	Cumin lamb is not lamb I think it's pork. Also it tastes bitter never recommend this.
__label__1	"justice for hercules !  

you are supposed to care for all animals. 

and now youre making a dog and family suffer!"
__label__1	Would give it a 0 but that is not available.  Terrible.  They lost a shirt and had to go back a dozen times over 6 months to get compensated.  They would only pay $25 for a $45 shirt.  Never will I go back to them
__label__1	I was standing in line for about 5 minutes and they just looked in my direction, then turned away. It was busy, but the least they could have done was take my order because it was only busy in the drive-thru. And I know that there is a person assigned to the dining area to take orders and give them their food. I ended up leaving and going some place else. As I was leaving I looked back and saw the customer behind me get helped with as soon as I left. This was my worst experience in any Jack in the box locations I have gone to.
__label__1	I was truly disappointed by the two pizzas I ordered here. The texture of both was of a soggy piece of paper? Picking up a slice not only did every topping & sauce slide off, but within 5 minutes of it coming out of the oven the crust underneath was already entirely limp and mush. Felt more like a crepe with a fairly mediocre sauce? The staff was very friendly, but I must say I have never been so dissatisfied with a restaurant.
__label__1	I am new to St.Louis and was nervous to get my haircut, but it had been 5 months and was desperate. I received a horrible haircut. I have fine hair and she dry cut it bluntly and  not point cut. Never offered me a shampoo. I showed her a photo of the cut and now to will take me 6 months to grow it out. I had to go to a different salon to have it fixed. It was uneven and not blended. Also the salon was dirty and outdated.
__label__1	I lost an AirPod in their seats and they wouldn't help me retrieve it, sucks now I only have one earphone and all they had to do was have one of their mechanics move the seat
__label__1	"Ordered online and paid thru their website only to find out when I arrived the employees decided to close way early because they are ""dead"". Website shows 10pm closing time.  Then the employee that finally opened the door was very rude.   

Terrible service and terrible representation of Buffalo Wings & Rings."
__label__1	"Bought 5 thousand dollars of worth stuff for my new house. 
Went back again to buy dining table. 
The Guys name CRAIG and KENDRICK kept following us like we are going to put that dining table in our pockets and steal it.
CRAIG and KENDRICK kept staring us and made me , my brother and mother felt so uncomfortable that we are theif.    And we were going to but the dining table and it's says that ask us for iur free shipping and the guy name CRAIG denied to give free shipping.
Idk they were being rascist or just rude for no reason. Will never go back again."
__label__1	Change your published hours if not open. Was there at 630 on a Sunday. Closed. Sucks to make plans only to have the place not open
__label__1	CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS AWFULLLL..Delilah M.  Didn't seem to care..The food was awful...really bland..no taste..This place is off of our list...$34.29...
__label__1	Wouldn't let us in with our service dog, shame... drove 1900 miles for this very sad that they would do this. Ruined the whole experience. Also not legal
__label__1	For the first time being here, I really didn't feel welcomed. The waiter completely ignored us as my wife and I stood by the entrance waiting to see if they seated us or we sit ourselves. The to tables that was available we're dirty and the two ladies that were already seating looked like they been there forever waiting to be served. The old man that was the waiter seemed more interested in having conversation with the group of men that was at the other tables. Completely disappointed, I love to try barbeque from different states and this is the only establishment close to the hotel I'm staying at.
__label__1	Dont come in hungry!...ordered chicken noodle soup and got 2 noodles and no chicken i guess what feels you up is the bread with the soup..and the sandwich i got was average nothing special about it....have to say the cleanliness of the place was terrible!
__label__1	This is horrible service! The guy that took care of us was very rude!!!!! Tall, accent, glasses standing 10 feet away can't hear a thing
__label__1	Just to let Cody know. My previous review was not fake, I did go to the restaurant and I was absolutely insulted that I had to cook tiny portions of my own food. I was hungry and was not about to cook with inferior equipment to that of my fully equipped kitchen/grill at home. Boo to you for defending a useless chain. If you want to pay $80 to starve, that's your option, but state your opinion, and don't attack mine, jerk (or jerkette if that's they case with such a androgynous name!)
__label__1	"do not buy from this place. they took advantage of my father, a retired navy veteran, they scammed him out of a lot of money & did some illegal, immoral, shady things. we are suing.....elder abuse is not going to be tolerated. do not trust them. the salesman, joe, should be ashamed of himself. 
zero stars!!!"
__label__1	Owner is mean!!! She is prejudice against people who are not rich and will only do work if you take her fancy clothes. I took some pants and blouses and she gave me a speech about it not being dressy enough and refused but then happily helped man behind me with hemming pants. Save your money and give it to someone who values all people and their loyal business.
__label__1	"Food is ok, service is absolutely terrible. I had to go find a waiter to come give us water & take our order, then they never really came back other than to bring us the food.
The people by us said it took over 20 minutes for them to come offer them a drink & take their order. 
Worst part is the restaurant is empty, there was no reason for them to be taking this long. 
I wouldn't come back."
__label__1	This hotel was terrible. The night check in guys were polite but the hotel it's self was run down. The door looked like it had been opened up with a pry bar before and the toilet did not flush right. The sheets were insanely itchy!!! I will never stay here again!!!! I'd give no stars at all, if it would let me continue without one!!!!!
__label__1	We placed an online order, where all of the requests are clearly in writing, and every piece of the order was messed up. What's strange is that each had something extra, unrequested, added on. The tacos had sour cream on them, which I cannot stand, and the veggie bowl was specifically requested to not have cheese, which it did. The chips and guac which were ordered and paid for were not included. Don't have an online ordering system if you're going to just ignore it.
__label__1	Food is okay but we won't be back because of the atmosphere.  Large open dining area with tables crammed together.  The designers did nothing to control acoustics and it was so loud we couldn't wait to leave.  Our table was the size of a checker board and we were so close to the next table we could hear every word.  I was literally closer to the stranger next to me than my wife across the table.  Once is enough, no reason to return.
__label__1	My goal was to get a yummy bagel and this place was so highly recommended and I got there and saw a bag of Thomas' bagels .  So if you want fresh bagels this is NOT place to go
__label__1	Great pizza...if you're able to get it served to you in a timely manner. Too many times i showed up here and never got my order taken. There are other equally as good options in the community
__label__1	This used to be a great place to study but their wifi barely works anymore. I've come here perhaps 5 times over the past two months, often with other people, and no one can use the internet unless the place is empty.
__label__1	Wow. Gave this place another shot last Saturday evening. Chicken did not taste right. Raced home for the bathroom. 2 out of 2 is enough for us. Eat at your own risk.
__label__1	Literally the WORST place to eat in Tampa.  My meat was undercooked even though I asked for medium.  The waiter was rude, and made sly comments about my weight and how I shouldn't be eating so much.  Pick McDonald's instead of here.
__label__1	"I have never heard of an Urgent Care facility that will not accept cash payments. In fact, I thought that was part of the point- that they will treat patients on an urgent care basis. My son just visited this facility, and was turned away because they ""do not accept  patients who do not have insurance"". Maybe they don't trust their employees to handle cash or credit cards? He is now on his way to another urgent care facility, which we will review after he receives treatment."
__label__1	"He never responded back to me.

He must only respond to the quality of his items.

Guess he doesn't care."
__label__1	They say 0% financing, but a year later when you think you're about to paid it off they will add ALL the interest for the whole year. It's a sneaky tactic that should be illegal.
__label__1	This place went to pure shit without the old staff this place will never survive. New staff treats people like shit and the manager passes out shots to girls then puts try's to get in their pants when he gets denied he charges them for the shots he ordered for them. What a pathetic place.
__label__1	Never returned to begin the job. He would cancel and reschedule over and over. A couple of time he never showed and I had to text to see if he was coming.  He would give me another date/time and still not show. Finally I called and he didn't answer. I then text... no response.  Gave up on him. Terrible communication and a waste of time.
__label__1	Trying to sleep and ignoring the footsteps I hear through the ceiling, but worse than that is the country music that vibrates the walls. Go to the front desk, and it turns out that loud music is a party they authorized and it is going until 1am. I'd avoid this hotel if they host late night parties, especially considering it seems to be a location for travelers.
__label__1	"Staff is rude as h#$#$#!
They must have classes to teach their staff to be rude.

Have had better customer service at our local DMV."
__label__1	"John, the owner, gives a great haircut and is fantastic. The rest is a just a headache getting an appointment with no organization in calling, walking in or attempting to coordinate with others. 

Great IF appointment scheduled in advance with John and not the weekend ... good luck with that!"
__label__1	The drinks were ok, I mean, how could you mess up a shot of Patrón. The food was bland and tasteless. We were told we had just a 20 minute wait, waited for an hour to be seated. People can in after us and were seated before us. Go to On the Boarder across the street and don't waste your time. What a Cluster!%*#
__label__1	worst worst worst worst car service ever. i ordered a car for 6 pm at 9 am. i waited in the rain until 620 to call and find out they are running with delays...another 30 mins. then i canceled my car. i woke up to find a 71.20 holding charge for no reason.
__label__1	This is the worst Dunkin' I have ever been to. Terrible customer service. Extremely angry with this Dunkin' Donuts especially since it's so close.
__label__1	Can't beg this place to give them my business. Stopped on a weeknight and was closed with a paper sign on the door. Ordered online and the order was cancelled after a half hour. Even tried to call in directly and nobody answers the phone. Plenty of other places to give my money to.
__label__1	Bought a medium drink n b4 I even got my straw in it. It dropped n spilled everywhere n instead of them just replacing it! She charged me for another one!!!! This is not customer service or the store I would recommend ever!!!!! And this not the first time that the customer service has Sucked!
__label__1	worst gym ever! the general manager is extremely rude! he had the most disgusting behavior and don't know how to explain things correctly! this is just another  money hungry company! i would give them a zero if i had a choice! do not join unless you want your money taken away!
__label__1	Disgusting. The place is filthy. The employees are rude. The managers should all be fired for incompetence.
__label__1	"Rude beyond belief! They had ""frozen"" my mom's Trust account for absolutely no reason. When asked, the ""gentleman"" said, ""Company policy. We don't tell you that it has happened."" Seriously! I wrote two checks for Trust expenses and I had no clue there was even a problem -- until the checks bounced. Horrible horrible customer service. My next move was to close the account. Done, through, finished. Never ever again."
__label__1	Horrible flower shop. They have a picture of a beautiful live rose plant on the website, but this is what the recipient received. Total bait and switch. Apparently the store thinks they can send garbage since the senders are supposedly not local. Will never be buying from this place again.
__label__1	My first experience at Terrain was great. Second one wasn't great. I went for brunch and ordered the omelette without cheese. It came stuffed with goatcheese (after waiting for 25 mins). My friend got their burger and finished it too, in the meantime I sent my omelette back and got a new one without cheese. Again another 20 mins later, it came back and was completely bland & sad. I think terrain is a beautiful place which is why I was so disappointed. I could've made that omelette myself at home. Don't order it!
__label__1	"Straight up rough.  It's like a fucking block party in there!  
The staff needs to understand that they are working in a professional environment -- that goes with their hygiene and their speech.  Me thinks I won't be going back there anytime soon - I rather starve on my break than to go there."
__label__1	"This used to be pretty good. Now the food is served lukewarm and tasteless.  The wait staff is incredibly slow, probably why the food isn't hot. 
Not going back."
__label__1	The food is great but the outside is a little sketchy. I do not like going to an establishment and getting accosted out front for money and being looked at like I'm lunch in front of my boyfriend...ewww....then they moved towards my car....I got back in my car quickly and left...went to another place...will never go back for safety reasons.
__label__1	I previously posted a wonderful review of Sungate Diner. It's minutes from my home and have great food. I sometimes eat breakfast with my daughter or often pick up breakfast or lunch.  Today the manager was not only rude when I asked her a question about getting my food, she responds stating I'm making this colored under her breath as I walk out. Very poor customer service! I have directed people for many years of this diner, and while predominantly white, I always felt a sense of community. Good to know how the owner views certain patrons. I will not be back.
__label__1	Made a reservations weeks before Mardi Gras that was cancelled two days before the reservation. This made it very difficult to get a new reservation.
__label__1	Ordene pupusas de chicharrón por $9.50. Me dio 3 tortillas secas y duras con chicharrón duro frito. No tenía sabor de nada y aparte de eso hechas incorrectas sin curtido y sin salsa de tomate. Arrepentido comoletamente.
__label__1	Hustlers!! Talked me in for $120 for 2 glass screens repaired. Ended up charging $220 because 1 supposedly needed an LCD also. Then called me again saying it was an extra $50 because new LCD won't work without the new ic chip. I said absolutely not, no more money. Turns out that iPhone 6+ screen and LCD is all 1 piece and Phone works fine without the extra $50 chip. They're hustlers and are done in my book, No more Cellfix for me
__label__1	"Bartenders are rude. I called and asked if I left my bag there and the bartender just said ""I doubt it"" and hung up. I'm a bartender myself, and a pretty great tipper, but I won't be returning."
__label__1	I do not recommend. I believe services are overpriced for the quality of preparation for and services in court. I am awarding one star because her staff was helpful when I contacted them.
__label__1	Don't waste your money or time.  Prime rib had no flavor, all the food served was tepid at best, and I upgraded my greens salad to a wedge and was charged full price.  Normal practice is to charge the difference.  When we brought this up to management he told us that was their practice.  Maybe you should inform your staff of your policy.  There is more to come when I'm home with a real keyboard.
__label__1	Ruined my oriental runner by failing to pre-treat carpet for running colors. They also bleached the fringe causing it to shred. This company does NOT know how to handle oriental carpet.
__label__1	From all the comments looks like we should have requested Jeff instead we got lee. Lee im so sorry we bothered you by ordering sushi from you at your sushi bar. Don't worry next time my friends and I will go to another place.  My deepest apologies again for ruining your monday night.
__label__1	It's just ridiculous how rude the clerk was for a simple purchase. He seemed hostile to even the most basic questions. I paid and left, but I won't be going back there ever again.
__label__1	"This place no longer has nail services that are advertised. When I stopped by to inquire about them they were not friendly and welcoming the way they out would expect with a spa. 

Since their prices are on the high end for the area, I expected a much higher end atmosphere than I experienced."
__label__1	"Service was fine. 
Food - not so much. 
Spagetti had twice as much sauce as noodles, so it wasn't very filling. 
This is the second time I have had bad food. Last time it was salad with tasteless dressing.
I sent them a note about it, but it was ignored.

I think I will wait a good long while before I return."
__label__1	Had a guy out here setting up wifi and he was pissed off and rolling his eyes at me the whole time. He also unhooked my cable and tried to leave before fixing it... The service is OK but the technician suck ass.... Get a different job if you hate it so much!
__label__1	Had tracked down a dealer who had an Equus on the lot for my wife and I to look at and get info and test drive. Drove down from Media, PA. was greeted by a manager who said he would get us a salesman. After 20 minutes of sitting in the showroom, by ourselves, we decided to walk out and leave. What a horrible experience, can't believe they are in business.
__label__1	I am completely disappointed with this cheaters. They replaced  my brake pads with some cheap product, as a result the car is making terrible noise when braking. Paid them a lot of money now need to go to different mechanic to change them. Guys stop cheating it hurts your reputation
__label__1	The food was good. The service Wendy however was sad and sorry. The server was a  pitiful excuse  for a server. She did not treat anyone at the table with any respect. To top it off a male server was running around with his pants hanging off his butt. He came to the table and asked if I had a problem after I saw him constantly looking at me.
__label__1	Ok after serving over 1 billion people when do you think they will understand that hot mean with steam and service with a smile (does help) but if you know what it know you just get coffee and move on.. I had to wait for food every other time and it not hot too.. just close and restaff
__label__1	So I ordered two rolls to go. 20.00 with tip. Coworkers brought it back to me since I was stuck at the office. Staff packed a whole two packets of soy sauce. So generous. Hope it didn't break them.
__label__1	Well slim chicken I'm a true chicken lover and I must say I don't love your chicken. Taste like something that you can make your own self when you trying to imitate a chicken sandwich from a fast food chain. I was excited because it was new and the line was wrapped around the building few times and that long wait was worth a whole lot of nothing. I don't know where you all  come from, but you might want to go back to the people that love this chicken because I don't good try though. Back to Lee's I go!
__label__1	Food was good. Unfortunately the service showed implicit bias. Me and my boyfriend were the only Latino people in there and were served 20-30 minutes after a group of white people who came in about 15 minutes after us. No one came to check on us or take our drink order at all before this. This is very unfortunate and the owner should train their staff to be aware of their bias and treat everyone equally. Especially when they are paying for service.
__label__1	The food is average, and definitely not worth a 2 hour wait.  We were told it would be an hour wait. After an hour and fifteen minutes we were then told it would be another thirty minutes. There are other Mexican restaurants in the area that are just as good, so don't fall for the hype.
__label__1	"The crab legs were old & extra salty....
You can tell the waitress didn't like tourist...
Which I would think is the majority of their business.  The service was Horrible!"
__label__1	This visit was my fourth time in a row with issues. Normally it is something forgotten from my order this time the whole order was missing. They were busy so I waited 15 minutes after it was to be ready before I said anything trying to be understanding. The lady at the counter said it was already marked complete and after 5 more minutes of them looking into it they decided to make it over again.
__label__1	The food was mediocre and the price was way not worth it. We waited for an hour and the food came out cold. The service was very slow and some of the servers were rude. We got the shrimp po-boy and it was mostly lettuce and a few pieces of tiny shrimp. Very bad
__label__1	What a joke! Most unorganized Popeye's in America. Four watching the NBA Finals while they have a line out the door.
__label__1	My fiancé and I stopped into Carmine's last night while in Ybor and I must say I was highly disappointed.  I loved this place as a kid but the food was bland and pricey for the portions given.  Sadly I wont be dining here any longer.
__label__1	Another looser.  i would give it zero stars if I could. I ordered food through Gubhub at 4:34, order acknowledged at 4:36 with a one hour ETA.  after serveral converstaions with grubhub and numerous revised ETAs the restaurant canceled the order at 7:58 so there was no way to order from anyplace else as most restaurants close at 8pm Christmas eve.
__label__1	Walked in Sunday the 17th,2017 around 1pm with a very hungry child. Was ignored by the hostess and other servers for 10 minutes before I said forget it and left. At least should have been acknowledged that I was standing there. Was right in front of the podium the hostess uses. Will not recommend or be back to this location.
__label__1	"Average bar food.  Good beer selection, although they are served in PLASTIC pint glasses.  Tacky.  Service is horrendous, and management doesn't seem to care. Server forgot beverages, forgot entrees to the point that the table was finished eating before the missing entrees arrived. Not a single ""I'm sorry"" or ""I apologize"" just ignored.  Management present yet did nothing.  This has been fairly consistent over several visits."
__label__1	Terrible Neighbors!  I want to like this restaurant but they are terrible neighbors.  Their customers take up neighborhood parking.  This restaurant does nothing to improve the value of the neighborhood.  I feel worse for neighbors that are closer and deal with the trees they have had cut down and the garbage left by patrons.  It would be one thing if they offered the neighbors whose parking they fill up coupons in their mailboxes but they do nothing redeeming for the block
__label__1	Worst manicure I've ever had. The nail tech was miserable. Kept saying she couldn't wait to go home. I asked for square filing. My nails were so slanted and not straight AT ALL. Sloppy paint job -- and didn't even use a strengthener base coat. My cuticles are a mess and so dried out. Came home and took the polish off immediately and evened out my nails. Would never go there again. Oh and no massage and it still cost the same. Just awful.
__label__1	I do NOT recommend.  Never recieved water while waitress played in her phone.  Place was not packed and the service still sucked.  The worst in NOLA
__label__1	Really bad service. Our breakfast (scrambled eggs) took over 30 minutes to arrive, even when most tables were still not full, and then the waiter got the order wrong. When the correct order of our breakfast finally came, we had to ask for forks and when he brought the forks, he had his hand wrapped around it.  We also had to ask for butter for our toast. Only good thing is location and the breadth of their menu. Avoid.
__label__1	You can tell that the Willow Grove Ave  Ritas is run with absentee ownership . Twice I have been there with a line and only one of the two employees waited on customers  the was in the back room.  none of the employees smiles or welcomes you there. Maybe their tip jar wouldn't be empty if there was some type of management on the premises.
__label__1	Don't Go There. The room and bathroom were dirty. The hotel is really really old and I believe they haven't upgraded it for a long time. The beds were very uncomfortable. The walls are thin and you can hear noises until morning. They charge you as much as a five-star hotel. The breakfast wasn't hot. There were only just two tables for breakfast. The service staff were unfriendly.
__label__1	Their machine sprayed gelato all over my clothing - manager offered no apology and refused to pay for dry cleaning. Garment is ruined.
__label__1	"Wow, wow, wow!

They managed to make Oscar Meyer Lunchable Pizza look and taste like artisan Old Country pie in comparison.

Im gobsmacked by the 5 star reviews. What kind of pizza have 5 star raters been eating? Mozarella sticks melted on Wonder bread dabbed with a bottle of ketchup?"
__label__1	Well we are  in Covid-19 era and I saw the cooks using their hands to prepare the food?Please take Covid seriously and use gloves when you making food for customers.
__label__1	Terrible service. We were told it was a 15 minute wait and then it was actually 1 hour and 15 minutes. Then we waited forever for a server. Will not be coming back. I would give less than 1 star if that was an option.
__label__1	By far the Biggest Catfish I have ever experienced from a restaurant in my life. I wanted to give a New business some support and ever time look at the pictures in my I get upset. Not to mention I only got 18 of 24 premie baby wings. I also had a baby fro on about 2 of my wing. Sorry but not sorry you got to do Better.
__label__1	Over priced, Snooty service, bland food.... I can make better food on a camping stove.
__label__1	Just left the store after waiting 22 minutes in line to pick up my internet order which was already paid. There were 18 people in line behind me and only 2 checkers. This store is always understaffed. Will not shop here or online again.
__label__1	One of the worst experience I really had. We are now sitting on the highway in New Jersey on the way to New York. Actually, the old bus which is being used by Peter Pan company got a flat tire. This is not the issue because it could happen but we have been waiting for anybody to help us for more than two hours. Nobody has come to help and the emergency service is horrible. After we got the flat tire the smile of smoke filled the bus and passenger got frustrated and hurried from their seats. I will not use this service anymore and I recommend you to do so.
__label__1	This Wawa is not the best. Parking is tight and their customer base is aggressive. Service is slow but otherwise no issues. They make a pretty good hoagie. they have no bathroom. Whoever heard of a Wawa without a restroom??? Not the cleanest. Some odd characters hang out in the area.
__label__1	"Awful, awful, awful! We arrived and immediately went to the desk for what we thought would be the cheapest and most reliable option. When we were told the price per person return ($38) I suggested we check the taxi price as there were 3 of us and it might be cheaper. As soon as I said that, the desk clerk turned really snippy and passive aggressive wishing us 'good luck with that'!
It turns out that the taxi is $15 cheaper for 3 of us each way so suck on that 'supershuttle' !!!"
__label__1	"12 of us came for lunch..we were the only people in the place...it took over 40 min to get the first food ordered. The first item delivered was a bowl of soup 40 minutes after ordering.

Horrible service and the food was also inedible."
__label__1	Not good. Skip this place if you can. Chips are warm and tasty but the meal was ok. Won't be back.
__label__1	Awful! Was just in to replace a screen protector. Girl was rude and dumb as a brick. I was told my protector didn't have a warranty but the more expensive one did of course when I was never told about this one in the first place. Completely dissatisfied with my service
__label__1	This place is so bland and overpriced.  We went for lunch and they served us frozen stuff, instead of fresh, what a waste of time.  I have had Ragu dishes that taste better than this place.
__label__1	Even though they have outside seating they don't allow dogs not even in the cage. Mean while when your outside birds are flying around trying to get at your food. Yeah cuz that's sanitary.
__label__1	Today I experienced the worst service I've ever had at a restaurant. The management needs to go back and take a refresher course on how to manage and keep customers. Never will go back!
__label__1	"I've been here 3 times, and each time I had the same experience.

The food is just so-so for how expensive it is, and the service is terrible. I can't justify giving them a fourth chance. Try Zataar on Country Club & Glenn instead."
__label__1	Would never stay here again to say the least. Elevator was broken, ice machine was broken and very dirty. Hope it improves before i come back to Clearwater again.
__label__1	"This place is awful. It was cold and snowing so I ordered soup, but I also wanted pizza. The soup could have been from a can( not a very good caned soup at that) and the pizza was only $2.50 for a ""mega"" slice. It was paper thin and tasted like a piece of wonder bread. This place sucks.

Edit: I actually got a stomach bug less then 15 hours after eating there. Not cool. Don't go here really. I hope they fail a a business."
__label__1	"This place used to be my go to spot when it was HESS location. Recently they seem to have given up their competitive edge. Same price as Wawa, but half the time you'll maybe wait 10 min only for no attendant to show up. (At Wawa, the response time is more like 10 seconds.) 

Never again! LOL @""Speedway"""
__label__1	This is probably one of the worst restaurant I have been to. Horrible horrible horrible service! I can't be more disappointed! The food was ok, but the servers were not polite and irresponsible. I felt like they don't care about service and sanitizing themselves. My server was literally yelling at my bowl of pho when he brought the bowl to my table. And I saw the split coming out of his mouth. Unbelievable!
__label__1	Poor service, average food and not much atmosphere. The bar staff seemed to think asking dor the specials and only ordering the discounted items was an impost, food we didn't order came out and some we ordered didn't come out but didn't do anything to fix it. Later charged additional items and charged 8 dollars for ice. Ludicrous.
__label__1	"All right this is always been one of my favorite customer stores. And I have told numerous people about how good the ice cream is . And ice cream is still good. But we went there today and come onDeters have you this lowered 
Your standards to this, this is supposed to be two scoops. Ice cream is still the best you can find but why don't you charge a little bit more and give a little more ice cream like you used to."
__label__1	The worst follow up skills in the state of Arizona.I wanted to do business w/ them but no follow up skills.They lost my business.
__label__1	Dirtiest hotel I've ever stayed in.  One star just for the friendly front desk staff, despite working conditions.
__label__1	"Genuine interaction with an employee:
Employee: would you like anything?
Me: I'm not sure what each of these are...
[Note the cupcakes are not labeled]
Employee: it's self-explanatory.  You can use context clues to figure it out.
Me: ...

At that point I used context clues to leave."
__label__1	Everything I ordered was absolutely awful. Crab Rangoons had very little filling, the orange chicken and my side order of vegetables tasted like they were prepared last week. Honestly, I've had better from Panda Express.... And that's saying something.
__label__1	They automatically sign you up for multiple visits throughout the year, it's impossible to get out of them, they don't have any way to cancel online, you have to call them. They are completely unprofessional. A corrupt company.
__label__1	So I totes just pulled a 2 inch long HAIR out of my eggroll. My boyfriend playfully suggested that perhaps it was my own hair, however, it was more than just laying on top. It was IN THE EGGROLL. I literally had to pull this hair out of the eggroll and my face turned from grossed out to horrified as I continued to pull on this long, thick hair. Never eating here again. Just hope I don't get sick.
__label__1	I'm just not a pizza hut fan. However my husband is so I tolerate it time to time. This will be my last time. 2 pizzas, sm order of over breaded wings and sm Apple pies for $56. Madness. But what as did it for me was the 6 inch strand of hair cooked into 3 slices of pizza. Why aren't the cooks wearing hair nets? Disgusting. No thanks.
__label__1	Piss poor management. This place is very unprofessional, I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy. The management there is so egregious on how they treat customers as well as employees. They only care about money not there customers.
__label__1	Horrible! If you want hibachi, the yummy yummy sauce is actually honey mustard, when asked if this may be a mistake they just looked at me like I had  5 heads.... The snow crabs were bad, the shrimp was old,the people were not friendly, and they will charge you a fee if you don't eat all on your plate! I can't say one good thing about the place!
__label__1	I specifically asked if my smog information had been sent and I was assured it was. Fast forward a year later, it was never actually sent so here I am required to get yet another smog check and having to pay another $50.
__label__1	I have never left a review on yelp but I had to let others know how horrible this place is. The diet coke machine was out of syrup and the TeX Mex was horrendous. They usually close a half hour before their scheduled hours and aren't open on Sundays contrary to the pita republic website.
__label__1	Was there on March 7 around 4:30pm.Had a table of 6. Never got service. We waited 20 minutes. No one came to our table. Watched other tables get service but ours. The hostess was nice though.
__label__1	Worst service !! Waited 32 min for a grill chicken sub. When I went to get my money back it was all of a sudden ready, then the MANAGER tries telling me that's how long grilled chicken takes.. ARE YOU KIDDING ME??? The cashier didn't know how to return my money!!! Moral of this story order your chicken sandwiches at least 35 min before you actually want to eat it..
__label__1	We came in today and it is a lovely little bakery but unfortunately, the people who work there are incredibly unfriendly and really didn't acknowledge us and then were extremely rude when we decided to not get a coffee since one person thought they had coconut milk and the other one thought they had almond milk. We won't be back
__label__1	Really bummed-food is great but service is horrible. Tried to give them a second shot tonight but sat at a table with menu in front of me, in a nearly empty restaurant (1-4 top eating) waiting, waiting and waiting. No drink order, no be right back, no someone will be there soon..nope-just me sitting...waiting. Decided not the place for me or a restaurant I would suggest to anyone.
__label__1	"And the day has come for Olive Garden- at this location, to close its doors. It was a mediocre restaurant at its best, anyway.

One Yelp."
__label__1	"Purchased a used 2013 Honda Accord in March 2016. All went good until now where I had to get the car inspected. A couple of them inspected the car and both told that the front bumper has been repainted and is been in an accident. When I bought the car, Glanzmann Subaru never mentioned this and kept it under the covers. Carfax showed no record of an accident.

New Buyers- be careful and get the car inspected before the purchase as it looks like this dealer hides information."
__label__1	Chicken Marsala was flavorful & asparagus is delicious. But the burger was a disaster. When you say fresh ground beef pattie, a piece of meat that looks like a frozen Wal-Mart pattie doesn't cut it. Good beer.
__label__1	The only thing I know for certain, is that the grease all my food was fried in is 3 weeks old. Pretty awful.
__label__1	Ordered a take out of 2 lasagna's and a medium pizza. Total disappointment! Both lasagna's were dry and lacking any sauce what so ever and my son's pizza was also dry with very little sauce as well. Called the management to discuss and she was dismissive and very defensive, would not listen. Needless to say we will never go there again.
__label__1	I stood at the counter for 25 minutes before an employee even came up to take my order, just to find out that what I wanted was discontinued. Even though it was still on the menu. After ordering something, I waited another half hour before getting it.
__label__1	I had an iPhone 6 screen replaced because the buff colored lines hiding my icons. Within a day the lines return but since I was not in the area I couldn't get back to the shop and bought an iPhone X because I needed the phone. I went back to the area to get an iPad Pro 12.9 inch screen replaced thinking they would now take care of the problem that was never fixed. Well I should've read the reviews before the first one because I see on Yelp is only at three. Live and learn. Buyer beware.
__label__1	Don't eat here.  The all female staff that works the restaurant are the rudest employees you will ever see. They openly argue are who is waiting on who.  They never smile.  They are annoyed if you ask them where to sit.  The manager just ignores them.  Im hoping this place gets shut down.
__label__1	Absolutely the worst Starbucks I've ever been to. Time and time again, the one lady who always seems to be on shift is extremely dismissive and obnoxious. Don't waste your time here, any other Starbucks location is better than this one. Disgraceful.
__label__1	I love chipotle food but not at this location. At this place, the service sucks and the food sucks. Recently, they gave me a bowl covered with mostly cheese, no lettuce,  and not filled all the way to the top of the bowl. Do I feel like I wasted my money? Yes. I won't be coming back here again.
__label__1	Expensive if you are on vacation. Guest services lady sat with me and my family until I left.
__label__1	Good management but sloppy service - buffed my nail down to the bed - then didn't file my nails. Had to repeatedly ask for clean up on red polish. Amateur job. Not worth it.
__label__1	"This is the dang hardest place to get in to.  They don't use Open Table for reservations.  They have the least friendly staff ""welcoming"" customers at the entrance you can imagine.  They have lots of high ratings but those apparently have gone to their heads and they are now arrogant and no longer welcome customers.  Instead you are privileged to be served by them.  Not the kind of place worth patronizing."
__label__1	"Horribly slow service.  Food was cold when we finally received it.  

I understand when a restaurant is caught off guard and slammed.  These experiences usually come with apologies.  That was not the case Monday night"
__label__1	HORRIBLE  service. They deserve no stars if it was allowed! Messed up everyone of our orders and we were last ones to get our order when we were the first ones to order our food! When we got our food it was cold!! I will never go back and I will make sure to tell people not to go there!
__label__1	"Since Vy sold the business has really gone down hill. Not enough staff that has their actual licensed. and poor sweet Daisy works her butt off and there is no way she can can do it all. Customer service is horrible, and I would encourage everyone to consider doing simple google searches on
Your nail techs, lashes, permanent makeup, or hair stylists. Remember they have access to your credit cards, and your family as we typically do like to share our personal info while chatting."
__label__1	"In the short time this location has been open (12 weeks), I've twice placed an order online only to drive there and see the store is closed. Once they said they ran out of some food. So I thought, ok, they are new. They need some time to get the hang of things. Next time, they were having a private party. 
Either fix your app to alert customers the establishment is not open or risk a bad reputation as unreliable and lose customers."
__label__1	"How could a candy maker and store be so unpleasant? From the ""no photo"" signs to the rude sticker on the packages yelling at you not to eat in the store to the average at best treats, the experience was horrible. It felt like we ruined the owners day by walking in the door."
__label__1	Ordered my pizza at 6:22pm. At 7:44pm, I thought, hey, where is my pizza? Well, I come check the phone number and give the store a call. Guess what I discovered, the store telephone number is disconnected. Shame on you Chikos, shame.
__label__1	Saw 2 bugs crawling across the bar during the 2 hours I spent here. Gross. Don't want to think about what the kitchen looks like if that's the acceptable condition at the bar.
__label__1	Don't waste time or money. Cold fries, wilted salad, very poor food! Never going back again
__label__1	I love chipolte and was excitéd to try the queso...awful. Very watery like soup and granuley..like its a powdered cheese..I also got chips and queso and pico..never got the pico..and was stuck with grainy soupy queso and stale chips..not good.
__label__1	"I just got off the phone inquiring about servicing a gas stove that won't ignite and the guy just says sorry the specialist for gas stoves is busy so I can't book you today or tomorrow. I never asked to be booked in stat but he wasn't interested in booking me at all. I was confused so I said ""are you telling me you don't want my business"" and he just says ""sorry, no"".  Don't waste your time calling these guys. They are not interested."
__label__1	Terrible. I'm ok with no frills but this way less than no frills. The employees moved at a glacial pace & answered their phone while doing their customers pedicures. One guy got up and left the customer to talk on the phone. He left her there for 10 mins at least. Never again.
__label__1	It was terrible. I had ordered soy chicken and fried chicken. I opened it as soon as I get it in H-mart, so I was expecting fresh and hot chicken. However  the chicken was not fresh. Flesh color was dark and hard. Couldn't eat because of bad smell. My wife and I bite each piece or chickens and decided to throw away. It was really terrible.
__label__1	I don't know why or how this got deleted, but this still applies...I've since gone to La Fontana and La Viola, and those were better choices.
__label__1	"Tampa airport location
20 minute wait time for 4pc tenders and salad. Staff not courteous and didn't answer questions regarding status of my order. People behind me received their orders before me. Customers with long wait received free cookies for inconvenience. I did not receive free cookies for inconvenience. Discrimination. Staff didn't offer apology for long wait. Worst experience I've had in a long time."
__label__1	after reading other reviews of this place. Nothing special. Wouldn't take friends to. Unless they weren't very good ones. Service c. Food c.
__label__1	I can't believe these reviews.  I've been there.  The place is extremely clickish.  If you didn't go to high school with everybody in the place, you could die of thrist.
__label__1	Miracle is what you expect on Christmas, it did not happen, they did not come two days before Christmas, on Christmas Eve and the worst thing is that they were BS us all the time on the time they come, like, we have plumber available to come before noon, the plumber is having lunch, we will call you in one hour and half. It stopped us to checking the alternatives, as a result we were unable to use kitchen through Christmas. The first day after Christmas, plumber from another company came early in the morning and fixed everything in 15 minutes.
__label__1	"DO NOT GO HERE! This place is a huge scam with unskilled ""mechanics"" - they tried to charge me $1500 when I took my truck in for inspection. They charged me $200 just to tell me that it was going to be another $1500. I took the truck to a real mechanic and  I was only charged $150!! Not to mention that these clowns were contradicting themselves on the work they said needed to be done RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME! Horrible experience!"
__label__1	I haven't worked with Karl Hawkins; however, Karl Hawkins was the opposition's counsel. I wouldn't trust Karl to put something in alphabetical order for $8 per hour.
__label__1	Service was terrible. Took 1 hour for the waiter to come out and tell us it would be another 30 minutes before our food was ready.
__label__1	"Been here an hour. The place had three tables here when we arrived. Asked the bar tender, while ordering second pair of pitchers, to send over a waitress for food order (had been waiting half an hour) They continued to ignore us for fifteen minutes. Acted VERY put out when we stopped the waitress to ask her to take our table's order. :-/ 
All burgers at table over cooked and despite menu description- NOT hand pressed. Cheese sauce was passable. Beef stew the same. Service so bad the taste it left in my mouth ruined the rest of the food.
Won't be back."
__label__1	Awful customer service from my nail tech. She charge me $35 for what I usually pay $30another place. She did not touch my cuticles or do a hand massage with lotion. When I asked her why she didn't do these things she said they were extra and it wasn't included. How does a hand massage with lotion and taking care of the cuticles be not included in a manicure?
__label__1	We've been to Masala Spice twice now and while the food and atmosphere are good, the service was very bad. Our rice and naan came 30 minutes before our main dish and was cold. Our server noted this and said he'd bring out a new order of rice and naan, but it never came.   Similar bad experience the first visit.  Wanted to like this place but won't be coming back.
__label__1	1 cashier and worlds slowest Jenny. I spent nearly 1/2 hour in line while Walmart employees decorated the front. Super frustrating
__label__1	Just had lunch here. Was not really impressed. Caesar salad was not good at all, romaine was brown, dressing oily. My crab cake sandwich was tasteless. No seasoning, just bland. Will not be returning.
__label__1	I placed an online order for 945 pick up. Arrived to the store at 950 and proceeded to the counter. The employees stated they were closed. I told them that I placed an online order. He told me that they don't have my order because they're closed and he stated every order that was on the counter belonged to the employees that were working. But, there was another customer before me received their order. So, I'm not understanding why I didn't receive mine. I'm 100% sure one of those employees took my order.
__label__1	They never have what's on the computer i always come after work and leave disappointed I end up going home without buying anything the people behind the counter play and talk too much
__label__1	"Two visits costing $600.00 resulted in an estimate of $3,000.00 to fix the HVAC system. 
Got another company to do it at a cost of $259.75 total, completed in 90 minutes. 
Even my complaints, calls and emails to the company went unanswered.
I would never use Horizon again."
__label__1	"Worst one ever. And they don't care 
Ask waited for my food one min turned into several
As the manager looked at me three times
No sorry no anything 
Burgers   are not good cold 
Never again"
__label__1	"One star because the memory is about the hostess and not the dining experience.

1.  Very good food
2.  Great chef
3.  Super service

4.  Horrible hostess who was indignant and inhospitable.
5.  Incapable manager who was not able to maintain control of her hostess.

Just need new management and then the evening will be perfect."
__label__1	Update on my visit:  the second filling that I had done (by the dental assistant) had to be replaced at another dentist's office today.  The filling was not bonded to the tooth was was causing me pain.   All in all, a horrible experience and a waste of money!
__label__1	Worst service I have ever experienced in the 10 yrs I have traveled extensively for my job.  After an 18 hr day or working I show up at 9:30 pm to check in.  After finding house keeping still in the room I'm told I will have to wait another hr before it is ready.  Unbelievable. Manager got nasty with me when I explained to her that waiting an hr was not acceptable.  I will never stay here again.
__label__1	Disappointed.  I had a pedicure and he cut my skin very badly.  I'm in infection-fearful person so that is not acceptable.
__label__1	If I could give them no star, I would. Highly disappointed in the service. Waited an hour and not even all the food came out. Owner and manager were unprofessional in the way they handle business. If this were to happen once, I would let it slide. But it is repetitively bad service every single time I went there. I highly recommend others to take their business else where. All you will get from this establishment is attitude and disappointment. I gave them one and too many chances.
__label__1	Ok so ... rooms has ants and bugs. And well the house room is grows. Rips in carpet and walls are bad. Just sad I paid for this. Will never stay here again.  And don't go to the pool. Mice and bugs. They do it care
__label__1	one of the girls that works the register is extremely rude and has an attitude for no reason. not sure what the coffee is like but if it's like her attitude, it'll be shit. wonder how people forget that the most valuable thing a business can offer and provide is great customer service.....
__label__1	First food poisoning of my life, i spent the night in the hospital...i would stay clear
__label__1	I love Chipotle and have been to many different locations and they've all been great except this one. It just has a very sad ambiance. I don't really know why. Maybe that's why I never see people inside - granted, I've only been to this one 2 times but theyve both been during peak lunch hours and Ive always been the only one there. It's awkward. And for some reason, the food at this Chipotle just tastes a little sadder and looks a little smaller than it does at its other locations.
__label__1	It took an hour to get our food. We watched 4 other tables get their food before us. Then we finally got our food an hour later they told us they were ubereats orders in front of us. Put your customers first then Uber Eats please. An hour later when we received our food it was very good, too bad I will never go again.
__label__1	I have been waiting on my package to be delivered since November 22 and it is now December 8. The package has been sitting in the Groveport,Ohio warehouse since December 1. I live in Indianapolis,IN. My delivery should have been delivered next day from Ohio.
__label__1	I'm sorry for the 1 star but honestly I believe that was being generous; the food is not Cajun...everything tastes like Chinese food.  The bourbon chicken tastes like teriyaki, the red beans and rice have no flavor at all.  The food is not good and definitely is not Cajun.
__label__1	They have really long wait times. It would have been nice for someone to have asked me what I needed before waiting an hour just to find out that they did have the wick I needed. . They never have anything in stock here. I'm never coming here again.  The service is not bad. Thats if you can get someone to actually help you.
__label__1	Very very bad food and tooo much $$$ for noodle soup. Very cool soup. Please don't go there if you don't want to waste your money.
__label__1	I visited this establishment  on thursday for a late lunch. I place my order. They came out to explain there had been a delay due to a malfunction in their printer. Within the next 10 minutes everyone had received their order except me. I inquired about my order and was told it was coming out shortly. After another 20 minutes I asked for a refund. I was there a total of 50 minutes. And they were quite rude when I asked for my refund. But after another five minute delay I was given my refund.
__label__1	Very disappointing sushi and service. Prefer and recommend Naked Tchopstix in Indy. 1/2 price sushi is still too much to pay for the quality.  And forget about taking anything home unless you pay for it at full price. The manager wouldn't allow us our 1/2 price leftovers that couldn't be choked down on the spot.  It is so hard for me to leave food to be scraped into the garbage. Won't go back despite having been going there for years.
__label__1	Every item I ordered a week ago came wrong. Not one thing was what I ordered.. Someone just threw a bunch of similar items in a bag and mailed it.. I use to buy Basic Edition items a lot
__label__1	Watch out for this one. Food is great, but the establishment/ management is horrible. It's was 85° in there last week, and when we complained, we were basically told to deal with it while we fanned ourselves with our menus. One eye sore was the owner washing dishes in the little hand sink next to the restaurant. Gross! She was also very pushy and crude. I've tried this place twice and both times it was uncomfortable.
__label__1	Oh five hapiness :( I use too love your food it was the only place i would even think to order from.Over the last few yrs the food has went down.My mom and dad use to go there 20 yrs ago and their was the owner walking around and if there was a problem she was right on it.Last 3 times we ordered food was no beuno:( Kind of pricey but was so worth it ,but not now oh how i will miss ya
__label__1	I wanted to like it, the staff is very friendly... Unfortunately the food is gross. Omelette with processed cheese product that never melted. Also, it was uncooked in the middle.
__label__1	24 registers and only 3-4 open every time I'm here. Long waits to check out .. Employees doing everything except helping people
__label__1	got a hard cold pizza tonite when I ordered a thin and crispy at this place for pick-up. Also, mgr at counter, Allegra, she was short fused and mean to employees and customers (condescending) and we heard her drop the f-bomb several times. Obviously, won't be back there anytime again!!!
__label__1	This place was bad. Our food took over an hour and it wasn't even good. We had a group of 6 and nobody liked what they ordered. Steak frites were tough, lamb was bland and not seasoned at all, shrimp and grits were very mediocre. Service was not good. While we were waiting for our food, we watched two separate couples leave because they had been waiting so long for service. Do yourself a favor and don't go here. We definitely won't be back.
__label__1	My own personal opinion when you have a small business things happen and you hope your bank supports you. I did not get that warm fuzzy felling
__label__1	Kathy was difficult to work with.  I don't see how other people said that she had a warmth and genuine nature about her, but I did not experience that at all.  I also felt that she overcharged me for the services she provided.
__label__1	"Pizza is terrible. Just terrible. I lived across the street for 2.5 years and only made this mistake once. 

The Stromboli - also terrible. Huge cubes of meat (ham I think) in a plain? Wasn't prepared for that one at all!

Cheesesteaks are pretty good, and of course you have to get cheddar topped tator tots! Delicious!"
__label__1	I was told by the employees at Chester County SPCA the small dog I adopted was a house-trained puppy.  He turned out to be neither.  My vet said he was between 4 and 5 years old AND he had no clue as far as house-training.  I returned him to the SPCA and the employees made me out to be the bad guy!   Stay away from this place!
__label__1	"Closed even thou their are employees 
In the store and the sign says open
Til 10pm and they wonder why people 
Dont shop here anymore"
__label__1	"The facility and the food is good. But the hostesses and the management are some of the rudest personnel I've experienced. 

Also dabbling in false advertisement is not recommended. When your website states that your establishment will be open until 11pm don't call out random last calls at 9pm. ""Door signs"" aren't enough, especially when people spend $30-$70 for Uber/Lyft to get there. Management should seriously be fired."
__label__1	ordered delivery, entire order was wrong, added toppings i didnt want and left out anything i asked for, cold cuts, not the best quality, don't waste your money here. thankfully, got a refund
__label__1	Absolutely horrible experience, they treat their staff extremely unprofessionally and rude making patients completely uncomfortable. On top of that some physical therapists are completely irresponsible in their treatment of patients making them do exercises DAYS after surgery. The Doctors/surgeons, however, are the exact opposite and very professional but it seems like anything past the surgery I recommend you go anywhere else unless you like dealing with inexperienced physical therapist who will waste your money by ruining any repairs the doctors have made.
__label__1	Came here for a one night stay. Booked a King room months in advance through the hotels website. Arrived and checked in.. went to our room and had two double beds. We went back down and told them we booked a king only to be told that they were out and those are reserved for their platinum members first. Would have been nice to know that in advance/before we checked in and went to our room. For $330 a night I should get the room that is booked.
__label__1	Went here to try their pastrami sandwich but was terribly disappointed. The amount of meat in the sandwich was about half of what is pictured on their storefront. Also the pastrami was so fatty we ended up pulling all the fatty pieces out. By the time we did that there was very little meat left on the sandwich. Most delis give a half or a quarter of a pickle. Theirs is a long thin slice. Will continue our quest for a good pastrami sandwich in Tucson.
__label__1	I recommend going just about anywhere but here. Wendy's, Chick-fil-A, Burger King even! I can guarantee you'll have a better experience than if you went here. This McDonald's treats their customers like inconveniences and doesn't apologize for it. Mean employees. Would give negative stars if possible.
__label__1	After $300+ you can't afford to offer me free refills on popcorn that cost you 5cents.  Am I the one who's cheap?
__label__1	Uber eats driver.  I drove across town. Took 12 minutes.  Got there and order wasn't even started.  Waited about 10 minutes. Still not ready.  We do not get paid for pick up or waiting.  Just driving and drop off.  Time is money.  And this was a huge waste.
__label__1	My Salad looks like garage...they didnt even bother to tare the lettuce apart, they just left it in clumps, and the rest of the ingredients were just tossed in.
__label__1	After three experiences at this location, I felt the need to leave a one star review. We waited three hours and finally got an answer from customer service that they didn't have a driver. I'm unsure why the store didn't contact me directly to let me know.
__label__1	Worst pedicure I've ever had. Manicure was bad as well, didn't removed cuticles and painted part of the skin. Not worth the $60 I spent. See pictures.
__label__1	Wow...what can I say but AWFUL. I made an apt in December. Finally got to see a Dr. In Feb. Still don't have the right script. They have bankers hours and I work in a hospital so I have to take PTO to be seen. Finally get my glasses for the second time...they don't fit and they are broken. My right contact...well I see better would it. This place is a joke. Both locations were a joke...go elsewhere.
__label__1	"Don't ever use Cable One, if I could give them a zero I would, or perhaps even negative. This is hands down the worst cable company I've ever done business with, and that's saying something. The picture I attached says it all, and they provided zero help. On one occasion they told me that if they were to come and check my internet speed and found nothing to fix they'd charge me $65 for having a technician come out. F*****G AWFUL! 

*Sidenote - I was paying $180/month for this crap."
__label__1	Terrible place.. took my dog here once and had a massive tumor growing but they didn't notice it or wanted to do X-rays on her.. very upsetting. I took my dog somewhere else where the DR was shocked that this place did NOTHING to get the tumor out! They almost killed my dog if I kept coming here! Never again!
__label__1	Only anglos can eat here without reservation. Solo los güeros comen aquí sin reservación.
__label__1	I don't understand how this place has 4 stars. The food was horrible. It took 45 min to get a grilled cheese. We ordered 5 waters and we just received 2 waters. When we ordered beer it came 30 min after... so yes, service is terrible.
__label__1	"If I could give no stars I would, but since that's not an option they have the honor of getting one star. I waited 40 mins to have my order taken, another 30 for appetizers, and another 40 for entrees. When we were asked about the wait time we were told ""it's a Saturday in Center City"" no apologizes or reassurance that our food was making its way out. When the entrees finally came out my food was cold and my friend was served RAW salmon. First and last time coming here."
__label__1	Still waiting for a response to the email I sent in November inquiring about puppy training.
__label__1	The Dj plays horrible music. Underground music that no one likes, he was rude and disrespectful when asked for a change of music.
__label__1	DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS ESTABLISHMENT.They take your money and do not fulfill the order.E mails are sent and are not deliverable.Telephone contact is impossible Really they deserve 0 stars.
__label__1	There was very poor service here. We walked in 30 mins before close at self dog wash and the man that was on the phone told we could not use their services. He never got off the phone while speaking with us. I was very disappointed because we have had great experiences before.
__label__1	Staff is rude and aggressive. We tried to shop here but were turned off before we entered the door. Go elsewhere if you can.
__label__1	Pathetic excuse for a fast food restaurant. This location has the laziest employees of all time. It's insane. They claim the drive thru is open 24 hours. I'd say 90% of the time I come here, the employees have barricaded the window and refuse to take orders, even though you can clearly see them inside doing nothing. Everyone at the store deserves to be fired. Management must be a disaster if they allow this. My expectations for a Jack in the Box are already low but this place just sucks.
__label__1	This has to be the dirtiest and most ghetto casino I have ever set foot in. For a place called Sugar house it is very poorly designed & a very ugly property. Poker room is packed with nothing but cocky attitudes and smelly degenerates. This place is not worth the trip.. Save your time, money, health and go to a different casino.
__label__1	The owner, Robert, was extremely rude to my family and I as we were attempting to work with him. Definitely don't recommend this company, get your services elsewhere!
__label__1	They got my order wrong I was very upset and this was my first time ordering from them I had ordered a salmon sandwich with sweet potato fries and with my sandwich I want to pepper jack cheese they didn't give me none of that especially I didn't get any sweet potato fries I was very upset
__label__1	The line is long and too slow. Then the kitchen is so small that after you've waited in line forever you still wait for your food so you're there for at least an hour before eating. Then the food is mediocre and the seating area isn't comfortable. They had a heater on so it felt like an oven. Not worth the hype at all.
__label__1	Overrated In East Nashvile! Located in hip historic neighborhood.  Food is absolutely drenched in ciantro..and the Margaritas are not wonderful either.
__label__1	VERY disappointed in Rom's and for one reason only--when a restaurant closes for vacation for two weeks it would be really helpful for a prospective customer to find that out on the first telephone call for reservations-like for instance, oh I don't know, perhaps have a voice mail message that states We are closed from when to when - instead of me having to run over there to find a sign in the window.  I mean, just saying.  I was looking forward to it too.
__label__1	Terrible customer service - owner is childish and arrogant. I see I'm not the only one to think that and the one good review is most likely her friend. We had her scheduled for an event and Charlotte Gillis started ignoring our calls. When I used a different number she finally picked up after weeks of no contact and leaving messages. As a real professional this blew my mind. I guess that's how people do things out here.... In any case just stay away from this company.
__label__1	This was a disappointment! Came here out of town expecting this place to be good! Got some wings. They were dry and cold. Than I asked for nachos instead and I got it in 5 mins. Great. Except they were also cold and soggy. Just disappointed!
__label__1	"Arrived without a reservation on a weeknight and was told they were cleaning a table and it would only be a minute to be seated.  20 minutes later, the hostesses were seating ""regulars"" and ignoring us.  Not a peep to us.  Considering how long they have been open, and how they bill themselves as a classy place, they should have seating down pat.  The bottom line, expect to be treated like hoi polloi unless they know you.  Personally, I'll spend my money somewhere else."
__label__1	Left prior to getting a seat.  Hostess never greeted me and just looked at me standing there for 5 minutes.  Left to go somewhere that has staff willing to do work.
__label__1	12 South Burger Up has been a weekly go to for take out. Decided to try this burger and fries. Could not be more disappointed in the slider sized patty and bottom dweller burnt fry slivers. I would have had a better meal at McDonalds at a fraction of the price.  I would hope the dine in experience is different from to go food but doubtful.
__label__1	"The service from the wait staff and from management has gone down hill these last few months. 
The foods great and the wine tasting bar has some great staff. That being said he wait staff has a lot to work on and unfortunately I don't see that happening with the way management chooses to handle or I should say not handle or correct situations."
__label__1	Very disappointed. They are at the Chaddsford winery today 7/11. We placed our order for lobster rolls at 1 pm. Its 240 pm and still no sign. Ridiculously long wait time for a food truck, considering their specialty is supposed to be lobster. Other folks milling around as well. Horrible horrible way to treat paying customers. The only saving grace is the wine. Avoid if you can.
__label__1	The proximity of this store and access are great.  Unfortunately the customer service continues to be mediocre.  I've been to this store several times for technical issues with my phone and my wife's phone and repeatedly sent out with instructions to go online or call sprint to speak with customer care only to find out that these issues need to be resolved within the store. I think I will have to find a new location to visit.
__label__1	This is the worst location.  Bathrooms are disgusting and the floors are filthy.  The food is over cooked and in some cases old.  Refills are out of the question so just get water.  Management here needs to be replaced.  We asked to see a manager and that took 25 minutes before they came over.
__label__1	"Took 40 minutes before I could flag down someone to get a beer, and was told I needed my server.
Got the beer and it wasnt filled anywhere close to the top.
Bad service is only outdone by their bad service."
__label__1	My 17 yo daughter went to the salon for only a haircut.  She had grown out her hair to donate to Locks of Love.   I thought the place was expensive $45 but I agreed to let her go thinking she would get a nice cut for senior class pictures.  She had her hair section off with hair ties then length was cut first for the donation.  Then they washed  her hair (not asking or telling her it would cost more).  After the cut, they blow dried and styled (also she was not informed this would be additional charge).  They charged her $70.  She paid more including tip.
__label__1	This used to be a great hospital until TriStar took over. Last time i went, there was disrespect of my privacy, and probably HIPPAA practices,  most of the staff was rude, honestly my nurse was an asshole, and they ran a very expensive unnecessary test. I filled out a survey with all of this info, being very specific, never heard from anyone or got a discount for my $3,600 bill which should have been $600. Hope i never have to go here again.
__label__1	"Wow, I have never had an experience like the one our family had tonight!  After being told by the ""owner"" that we weren't allowed to park in the parking lot even though we had a reservation we went ahead and sat down at our table, ordered drinks, and then ordered dinner.  Before our dinner arrived we approached the owner and questioned why he had told us we couldn't park onsite.  At that point he became extremely hostile and aggressive towards us.  We then paid our bill up to that point and left.  I do not recommend that experience for anyone!"
__label__1	I asked them for a chubby chicken lettuce wrap with no bacon because I am Muslim and do not eat pork.  So I kindly returned the food and told them that they put bacon on it when I could not have it. All they did was took the bacon off and gave it back to me when I asked for a new one. You could smell the bacon and the grease all over the chicken so when I returned it the second time they tried to lie to me and tell me it was a new one.
__label__1	The front desk needs to pick up phone and they are the worst in customer service.  They put you on hold and never answer the phone. You end up calling again. The nurse is good and the doctor's are great. They need to change those people in the front desk. They are rude and inefficient.
__label__1	"Terrible customer service. We called in and were told the food would be ready in 30 minutes for take out. 

Upon arrival we were told they needed another 10 minutes to finish the order. They were not ready for over 60 minutes from when we placed the order.

The staff and cashier spoke amongst each other as we and customers tried to order, pay, or pick up their food. My card was left in the payment console beeping while the cashier fought the staff.

This restaurant needs to separate the kitchen from the front end. At least the food was good."
__label__1	Very disappointed after reading such good reviews on yelp. We had a red top vegetarian works. The sauce, cheese, and toppings were mediocre. The crust was very soggy that we had to eat our pizza with a forks and knives as we weren't able to pick up the soggy crust with our hands.
__label__1	We went for drinks after the dining hour - about 8:30pm. The bar staff was great but our server was SUPER slow.  Out party of eight ordered beers, 20 minutes later our server had brought two drinks; we had to go to the bar ourselves to get the others. Our 2nd round was the same thing all over again. I can't recommend this place due to the inattentive service we received.

__label__1	Just came in with a friend and we left right after his appetizer came out, he ordered spring rolls and other food which he ended up canceling.   The spring rolls came out pretty burned, when my friend brought it up to the host he laughed in my friends face and told him they were the last two they had so he didn't know what to do for him.  This ontop of us sitting ourselves and getting our own menus just pushed us to leave.
__label__1	I got a chocolate shake today. Well it was all syrup. When I say syrup it was so dark you couldn't see the writing on the cup. Didn't really pay attention when I grabbed it and my food. Couldn't believe they would actually think someone would drink it. Well I threw it away.
__label__1	My fiancé and I went in today to kill some time. We weren't really hungry so we order a sandwich to split. My half has a hair on it. No problem things happen. They send out another half club sandwich, and the bread isn't warm. So i ask for the other half of the sandwich. They don't have it, they didn't even deny that they just pulled the hair off and sent the sandwich out. It's sad because the sandwich was actually pretty good
__label__1	Made an appointment for 7pm this evening to see a truck. Cody the internet sales manager doesn't have the decency to tell me it was sold yesterday when he texted me earlier today. And he doesn't show up for appointment. They probably sold the truck a month ago.
__label__1	This McDonald I'd one of the worst locations I have ever been to. They rarely give condiments. I ordered pancakes and not butter or syrup was given.  I went this morning and this will be the last time. I waited 5 mins at the order window no response when I asked if anyone was there. A women drive up to the other lane and was immediately served. I drove away never to return.
__label__1	Complete & utter bullshit company. I'm sorry I don't like negative reviews & I don't like a company that doesn't honor their mistake. I was given a tire & the tire was dry rot & it also had an egg. I brought it back but they wouldn't exchange it because it didn't have writing in the inside. I paid cash so I was not given a receipt. But one thing about it I will never go to another Tu's tires again & neither will my family or anyone I meet & happen to have a conversation with them about it.
__label__1	"Horrible customer service, to say the absolute LEAST. The owner of the place was visibly ""yelling"" at employees for the portions that they were serving customers, not to mention the owner never uttered a smile the entire time I was there ( talk about UNFRIENDLY). Cost control is one thing , but devaluing employees is another. I do NOT plan on dining here anymore, and I have been sure to tell ALL of my friends and family about the horrible customer service that I experienced at this establishment."
__label__1	Oh lord. I just wanted a Large Iced Coffee and a Maple Bacon Sandwich...  but the lady is just slamming everything around her. Iono if she's having personal problems or what, but she needs to keep that in check before serving her customers. Definitely NOT coming back in this location again. Get another job if you can't even do basic customer service. Sigh...  it's only 12:58, she so mental.
__label__1	Waited 2 weeks for the service department to contact us just to have them tell us we needed a 156 dollar part including installation to repair our patio door. This was to be prepaid and would be at least a month. The part was 21 at home depot and was repaired in less than 10 minutes. Pricing is not the issue, but to wait 2 weeks to be told give us money and wait another month is unacceptable.
__label__1	BAD SERVICE RUDE AND AGRESSIVE CUSTOMER SERVICE. I have needed my air repaired waited and was repaired and in less than an hour stopped working. When I tried to call after 10 tries the customer service guy was so rude. He was defensive and inappropriate I am writing this waiting on AHS to speak with them about this and get some resolution. This is so bad!!!
__label__1	The only great thing was the view! The food was okay! Nothing special. They called last call an hour an 15 minutes before they closed. The server was quick the get us in and out. I'm a server as well and wouldn't do half the things they did. Went to the bathroom before we left and when you walk in the people that work there are sitting down on their phone. Too many better places to go than here. It also took 30 mins to get our appetizer!
__label__1	Waited over an hour... said no tables where available. What are these?  Horrible service. Only offered to give the tables to use once they saw me Snap this photo.
__label__1	To avoid. Lady at front in the morning weekdays is always busy checking her cell phone. Never a Hi, welcome, bye, nothing. She frowns at clients when entering (you bother me when you come here is the vibe). bad attitude. Men locker rooms are too small. Men showers always dirty and smelly at 7.30a. Overall it seems to point to weak management. usually LA fitness clubs are well kept and friendly. This one is the worst I have ever seen.
__label__1	Ordered a large pizza with just the regular sauce, and Italian sausage slices. DISGUSTING. It was so spicy (why?) that we couldn't eat it! Tried one of the sausage slices alone to see if they were the reason. Nope! Threw it away. Never again. And they didn't even slice it right! Haphazard slices, round, square, or just weird shapes. It's like they sliced it while blindfolded!! Wish I didn't have to even give it one star.
__label__1	"The salesmen dropped by our door and sold us a finance plan like a home equity loan but never informed us that it was a credit card (turns out it is part of the whole Wells Fargo Credit Card scandal).
BUYERS BEWARD: NEVER. EVER TALK TO THESE SALES GUYS. WORST KIND OUT THERE."
__label__1	Awful. It took over 20 minutes to get a hot dog. The order was wrong. The lady behind the grill had a major attitude. Nothing good about this place.
__label__1	"We love to support small local restaurants and wanted to try one we had never been to.  Even though the reviews for
Enzo's were mixed we wanted to give them a chance.

NOT GOOD sadly.  The soup was so salty that one of us couldn't even eat it.  The penne with sausage was just as salty.

The waitress assured us the soup would be deducted from the meal - it wasn't.   Two dishes of penne barely touched and no clue that we weren't satisfied.

We will never return and definitely do not recommend."
__label__1	Dude upstairs threatened to kick my buddy out cause he didn't tip fast enough. He kicked him out. I said that was a dick move he was waiting for change. He kicked me out to. He threatened to push me down stairs and I only have one leg. Crappiest bar on river street.
__label__1	"I had my vehicle towed here for tire replacement on a flat.  After I paid and entered my vehicle to leave my tan interior was covered in grease. I immediately went back inside to advise them. Someone came out with a bottle of ""TUFF STUFF & a white tile"" spayed and wiped and had to repeat several times before grime was off. He attempted to be done with noticeable spots still there. Where he wiped extremely hard changed the texture of my leather leaving a smooth surface."
__label__1	"A few weeks ago I brought my car back to have the 25K service, as toyota provides it for free.  For my surprise, on the previous service they had set up my car to have the light to go off with 26K! So, when I brought my car in, they said it was out of the Toyota package due to the over mileage... 
Surprisingly, they had done the 20K service and they set my light up to come back on with 26K, so I would've to pay for it...  DO GO HERE!  THIS DEALERSHIP IS A SCAM!!!"
__label__1	It's one of the worst places I've eaten at in while. We ordered for some nachos, chicken Alfredo and the fried chicken all American. The fried chicken was stale and the oil it was fried in was probably old so it was stinking. The nachos are coloured hence having too much dye which I think is not good for the body. Beware before you order. I'm attaching a photo of the stale chicken I received with cheese that's probably 100 years old.
__label__1	"Extremely rude host at the front of the restaurant.  We had a reservation and when we asked if a different table was available, the host seated another group and told us it would take 40 minutes to reseat us.  We were a bit shocked by his reaction to a simple question.  Guy had an ""attitude""."
__label__1	I love Smashburger in general.  I've been to this location twice, and both times they have messed up my order.  The first time they offered to fix it, but I was in a rush, so I just kept it.  The second time I ordered from there I ordered online thinking they can't mess up an order in writing.  This time the burger was missing all of the add ons I paid for, and the spinach they did add was wilted and disgusting.  That was my last time there.
__label__1	Very disappointed.  The food was extremely overpriced, with little to no taste.  I ordered the crab tagliatelle.  It tasted like noodles with water and crab from a can.  I don't remember ever actually leaving a review, good or bad, on yelp.   But in this case I had too.  There were some positives.  Avoiding the line in the food court, the mushroom soup, and the bread.....
__label__1	I just received  terrible uber eats order from here. They sent me the wrong pizza, uncooked wings, and a FLAT 2 liter of Pepsi. Do not order from here. I  WANT MY MONEY BACK.
__label__1	Fast break member who rents all over the us. Worst customer service i have ever seen. The 50 year old black woman treated me so bad i bought the insurance just so she wouldn't find any thing on the car and try and charge me extra. Do not rent from here catch an uber and rent for a city location corperate complaint number 27962305 !!!!!!
__label__1	Over priced 900 for just lenses and one frame. This place is an absolute rip off they justify the price saying it the RX one order. But my eye have improved over time. Took me two hours to get that far as there systems is out of date slow if not completely down. Last time I use this RIP OFF.  Place.  Fuck Lenscrafters. Con artists
__label__1	"Horrible food. Weird decor. Worst thai food in st louis!!

The spring roll came out soaked in sauce. The outer coat was neither crispy nor soft. The inside was luke warm and gross. There was ketchup next to the rolls!! Who eats ketchup w their spring rolls????"
__label__1	My friends and I planned an outing today at the Westwego Farmers Market.  Just arrived and the place was Closed!  So disappointing!
__label__1	We stopped by for lunch, still cannot eat inside. We ordered on line and picked up at the curb. My husband got hot dogs they didn't put mustard in the bag just ketchup. The burger was pretty good. The most disappointing thing is they brought out melted milkshakes. So that was disgusting. They put them in the bag and it was closed up so we didn't see this till we drove away.  I will not be returning!
__label__1	"I ordered. Explained my food allergy to onion. The waitress came back and said what I ordered had onions and couldn't be changed. So I changed my order. When my beno box came it had onions in 2 spots and the soup was topped with onion 

I picked off what I could. My allergies to onion allow me to take a pill after but that's not the point. 

I would not return."
__label__1	Hello, and welcome to the worst concert venue in North America.  I've never been anywhere else in my life where the sound quality is better outside the venue than in.
__label__1	"By far the worst experience I have had in my entire life of dealing with a car dealership.
The way we were treated at the dealership was unprofessional and now I find that they ran my credit 12 times thus destroying a very clean credit rating due to numerous hits on my credit, just talked to their finance department and they are totally unwilling to contact the credit agencies to assist."
__label__1	TERRIBLE. Worst service and food. The woman kept forcing me to buy this and that. The was service made my plan to make it to go. I took the food at home. And WOW. Gross. Worst. Im never visiting there ever again.
__label__1	Total rip off place. Matt installed a old sway bar because it last just over a year, after warranty. Don't go to them. I had to take my Toyota to dealership.
__label__1	Stay away from Dr. Jarrett and her staff. Unprofessional and lacking in basic commutation skills.
__label__1	"Check your orders on drive thru! This place shorted me on munchkins. C'mon, really? 

They also only seem to sell 2 or 3 varieties of munchkins at a time on Dunkin menu. Also don't go here on game days as their ice coffee tastes diluted. I'd rather pay the full price and get good coffee than throwing away bad $1 coffee after a sip."
__label__1	"They don't actually stay open until 6pm! I got there about 8 minutes before and they had already locked up. When I knocked on the door, they told me it was after 6, despite their own large clock saying it was not even 6 yet. Did not care my child was obviously miserable and only needed his ears checked. 

The only other time I have gone, I was the only patient in the clinic and they still made me wait 20 minutes in the waiting room and 10 in the room. The doc has the bedside manner of a dishrag. No thanks."
__label__1	Don't believe the office hours shown on the internet.  Brentwood is suppose to open at 9:00 and Franklin at 8:00.  Show up before 10:00 and you will be met by a locked door and a sign that each opens at 10:00.  A waste of time and gas.
__label__1	"This place is awful!!! Rude service horrible food , frozen fish , overly cheesy dishes this place is a disaster... If this is Italian, let alone Good Italian then I'm Frigging Marco Polo!!!
Avoid at all costs... Or dine at your own peril..."
__label__1	"No...just no. Decided to give this place a shot, ordered on a weeknight, was told delivery would take 30 minutes. An hour later I called and was told ""it's out for delivery"". So, an hour and fifteen minutes later our food arrived. Pizza was soggy and gross. Couldn't pick it up without the cheese sliding off, the fries (I asked for well down) were almost raw and wet, and the burger was not even edible. Everything went in the trash. Won't make this mistake again."
__label__1	Moving my review down to a 1 Star. The manager advised that his manager would be contacting us the next day regarding our experience, and never did. It has been 2 weeks. This company must not care too much about customer service.
__label__1	doesn't this place have anyone with knowledge in it? They should take hardware off the sign because they don't sell any. The building should just say lawn and garden instead of hardware. All I hear about from them is about the green egg. What a joke. Prices are outrageous as well.
__label__1	I wish I could give this 0 stars.  This is by far the worst place on the planet.  I was in yesterday and the workers were yelling at each other as to who was going to wait on me.  I actually thought it was a joke.  Both ladies were claiming they had to go on break and screaming at such a piercing level that I almost slammed my own head through the plate glass window.  Its hard to believe the USPS is in financial crisis.  I actually want to grab a lawn chair and a six pack to just sit and watch the insanity unfold over the course of the day.
__label__1	"the really dont like military, especially when in uniform.  (even on a special community day) I  know from personal experience on that one.  
Go to Applebee's or Smokey Bones instead  where there is not so much tention on military ( especially when they are in uniform and living so close to a huge base)"
__label__1	I wanted to try this sports bar as I had walked past it plenty of times. I ordered their bbq bacon cheeseburger, a Guinness, and their pretzels. The Guinness came bubbly and poorly poured, fizzy and no head like it was poured by a 5 year old. The pretzels were just bread with salt on it. The burger was supposed to come with tots came with 5 tots. FIVE TOTS!!! No exaggeration! Burger was scalded to a crisp, hardly eatable. Terrible experience. Incredibly over priced.
__label__1	Service is so slow here. I came here on a weekday, afternoon. There weren't any customers but myself. They took more than half an hour to make me the pork belly rice bowl. Just to find out they served as uncooked pork belly. Only the outside was burnt... Dont know how that happened. I sent it back and they took a while just to tell me that they ran out of rice... Wtf. Anyways I got a refund after waiting some more. Worst experience ever.
__label__1	"Called and the first thing I asked was if they accept my insurance. They told me yes so I scheduled an appointment. Several weeks later when I walk into my appointment, they tell me that my insurance is out of network and had me call and talk to my insurance company on the phone. 

The receptionists are clueless and wasted a month of my time. Don't even bother with this place. I would rate zero stars, if possible."
__label__1	The rides and lazy river were nice, but the water was just as hot as it was outside. Then there were concessions... I waited 1 hour and 20 minutes in a line of no less than 20 people to get water... and that was after waiting 10 minutes for the Icee machine to break down. Poorly ran and managed, although I came another time before this and had a pleasant experience, this was not.
__label__1	"I am a frequenter of this place... great bar normally. I cannot take that from it. You can smoke indoors, and enjoy yourself and the company around. The other night was quite the opposite. We encountered a very rude and inconsiderate bartender from the moment we walked in. She was very disrespectful to my friends and I; never have I encountered this in my entire time visiting  paddy's. Needless to say my friends and I will no be coming back.

Less than one star if possible."
__label__1	Do not ever buy a pet from here.  I bought a dog June 2014. She's was sick the whole time I had her. She died last night. Genetically her pancreas and liver didn't grow.  I researched her breeder he is a puppy mill breeder.
__label__1	Such a small menu , the one good thing they have on the menu is always sold out smh how can you sell out of a chicken dish
__label__1	This place is always understaffed and the cramped office is great for contracting other people's illnesses! Management must be asleep at the wheel (or worse, they couldn't care less)
__label__1	Bought a beautiful car there. Very clean. Less than 24 hours later the engine light came on. Catalytic converter is bad. Expensive job. Anyone that clears a code and sells a car to you is not very trustworthy. Gets me sick.
__label__1	Not sure what happened today but very disorganized. People were waiting five hours to get registered for a test. Five hours for us to get tested. Maybe it was insurance verification but still it seemed very unorganized.
__label__1	I dropped in today and there was one customer. I looked around for 5+ minutes while the young lady behind the counter helped the customer pick out items for a large order. When the customer finished and paid, I looked at the young lady,  she glanced my way and then diverted her eyes to a customer that just then walked into the store (they seemed to know each other). She spoke to them and began to take their order. I stood there stunned, and was ignored. I walked out. Horrible customer service.
__label__1	"My wife's wedding band was sent to this location for repair from a Zales store after losing a stone. They were given specific instructions to double check all of the settings before sending it back to Zales. We picked up the ring, and within 15mins of picking it up a stone was missing! Completely unacceptable workmanship. 

While our main gripe is with Zales it is worth noting that they rely on outside vendors like this one to do repair work. In this case the repair work, or the quality control aspect at the very least, we're completely unacceptable."
__label__1	Avoid. It's overpriced and lacks flavor. The noodles seem like they were poured out of a cup ramen and the broth is flavorless. Even if it was great ramen I'd be hesitant to pay $14 for it, but for what you get, the $14 is outrageous. It's nice to have another Ramen place in town so I hope they either readjust their prices or work on their recipe, or both.
__label__1	Made an appointment so I could fix my nails on my lunch break, when I got there at the time my appointment was made she said to sit and wait as they were just starting pedicures. Appointment meant nothing I guess..
__label__1	Starbucks is literally out of every single thing I ever order. Today I ordered an oatmilk vanilla latte but of course they had no vanilla syrup, no toffee nut syrup, no caramel syrup and no oatmilk. Like what? I won't be back to Starbucks because they literally never have supplies.
__label__1	This place wouldnt accept my US Currency. I tried to pay with a $100 bill. The gentleman told me that they don't accept $100 Bill's and he couldnt complete my order. Since when is US money only accepted in smaller values?
__label__1	"Tried using it today but the washing bay machine accepted my money but it would not start. It seemed to be broken, there was no water or soap dispensed. It ate my $3. Of course there was no one on site to get your money back.

DO NOT use this car wash. But if you HAVE to use it, like I was desperate to wash my car after driving through snow, then make sure there is water in the bay indicating someone actually used it and it works."
__label__1	Extremely rude , unprofessional and harassing staff . Gang of idiots with no manners .
__label__1	I received a mailing from this company that offered a Free Fit Kit. When I called to get the offer and was told they wouldn't honor it. They said it was no longer funded. Well then they shouldn't have sent me the offer. They sure did try to get me to come in for an appt. though. Sneaky and no integrity!
__label__1	I wouldn't go to this Dollar General. The cashiers aren't friendly at all and will get mad at you if you want to delete an item from your purchase.
__label__1	Very disrespectful, my family simply wanted to get some cinnamon rolls for New Year's Day, the employees refused and were extremely rude towards my dad, one was was listen to music and saying remember crap, won't be going there for a very long time! I know my family will file a formal complaint towards them, there was no sign, nothing, just a bunch rude employees
__label__1	"SCAM! I hope my identity isn't stolen after going through the application and request for a viewing. Once I applied and PAID the fees the property of interest was ""just leased"". How convenient. And they wouldn't respond to my emails or phone calls. Voicemail box is full every time I call. Be careful if you use them!"
__label__1	Drink specials are ok but not on par with every other bar in the area. The food is absolutely terrible. I have been dragged multiple times with friends and have tried out almost their entire menu. It seems like everything is bought frozen at BJ's and slightly warmed up if you are lucky and thrown on a plate. The waitstaff is friendly as they are college kids in the area but the barstaff who are straight from Ireland who are straight from Ireland cannot be bothered to take your order.
__label__1	Ugh, I can't stand going to Dick's but sometimes I can't find anywhere else to go to find things.  The service is beyond horrible.  It is next to impossible to find anyone to help you or to open a dressing room.  Then, when they finally do open a dressing room, they act like it is this huge inconvenience if you need to try on more than 3 items.  I am going to try even harder to avoid this place.
__label__1	well...what do you know. They scratched my brand new SUV and denied it ! What a scam!
__label__1	To start off, I never even got to the car wash.  I called ahead of time to see if they do interior cleaning.  All I wanted was a quick vacuum and some armorall, but I was told that they MAY or MAY NOT get to it.... it all depends on if there are other cars in line.  Pretty rude phone service and a lousy excuse.  So I won't wasting my time to take my car to this carwash.  I'll continue to go to the one on 309 in Montgomerville, where I know that they will clean the outside and inside every time.
__label__1	I purchased two tickets to a Murder Mystery in March which was later cancelled. Understandably, not their fault. However, over 5 months later, Arnold's has still not issued refunds for those customers who purchased tickets. Furthermore, they have been completely unresponsive to emails requesting refunds.
__label__1	"Sub par, blended food. Overly fatty steak, flat drinks, blend tuna appetizer. Mentioned that to the waitress, but, received ""that type of a steak is very fatty"" reply. Trust me, this is not my first steak. Asked for a medium and received rare. Never mind that it cost 60 + dollars for a cut which was simply unbeatable. Shocking to see how that type of restaurant went down hill in only few years. Left feeling like I was rubbed. For a 500 dollar dinner and 100 dollar tip I expected better. Birthday dinner was ruined. Simply shame."
__label__1	"The Turkey and avocado BLT I just got my wife was wet. Actually wet. The Turkey was in a huge ball in the middle of the sandwich and it was loaded with Mayo. Clearly they do not care at all because I went through the drive thru at 3pm on a Sunday! It wasn't during a busy period or anything. I would say go anywhere else around this location. We are getting a lot of places to eat on this side of town.

I gave them a second chance. 28 minutes i waiting in the drive through!"
__label__1	"This is the most overpriced thrift store I've ever been to. What a joke!

$3 for used glassware? That's about what you pay for new! $50 for a metal candelabra?? Seriously?? Or the $50 shoes? Come on."
__label__1	"Managers ganging up on you, intimidating you to buy. will make you sign stupid stuff like they will write on paper that ""if numbers match I will buy it today"", etc. Sh*t show going on there. Really shady business. Person in accounting talks so fast and will rush you through all the papers and you will see some charges applied that weren't communicated to you.
They will lie about warranty and stuff to make you buy then make you sign a paper that ""all the communication is legit if it's on the paper.""
AVOID KIA OF CHERRY HILL AT ANY COST."
__label__1	"The best way to describe this place is ""lipstick on a pig."" Overpriced, rundown, and dirty. I've stayed at bad hotels before but this is by far the most expensive of the places that fell into the ""terrible"" category. This place is listed as part of the ""Premier"" collection by Best Western, which is a joke. Best Western should drop this place if they don't want their reputation to go down with it."
__label__1	Don't visit here! If you have to, remember check your credit card records! I've been here twice, and each time they charged more than the receipt! It's unbelievable. The last time I visited here, my friend and I got our cards charged three times each person. Remember to check your credit card! Their behavior is disgusting.
__label__1	"Went to watch the NCAA tournement because they say they are a sports bar.
First no volume then it turned into a dance club.
Food was great. The rest was a major disappointment."
__label__1	If you would like to be lied to please go here! We took in our car for a rattling noise when accelerating and $600 later our car is still rattling. We went back so that they could fix the issue and they did; however, had they fixed the real issue in the beginning we would have only been out $200.
__label__1	I scheduled an appointment with them for Tuesday for an Ac unit repair and  no one came. I call them and they said the technician was delayed it was already 7pm and no  one came i called again and they said that I needed to reschedule. The following appointment was Friday my frustration was over the top. I waited until Friday and  no one came no one call me and they say again to reschedule. What can of service is that. Worst service ever, dont ever use them.
__label__1	It was terrible is unbelievably terrible they're out of everything we ordered through GrubHub GrubHub was good but our order was all jacked up the food was horrible no flavor we ordered chicken dinner and got chicken wings got no corn bread I wouldn't even give it one star
__label__1	"First time and very disappointed as half the machines empty or down, half the toppings empty. Boy working was very rude, said under new management and no manager working. Should be ""NO GO AWFUL"" instead, won't go back!!"
__label__1	"Worst customer service and terrible showroom.  Not the store and service that once existed.  
Would never shop here again."
__label__1	Prestige called me today and got me in to fix the chipped tooth. Dr. Horwitz actually did a great job.
__label__1	"oh my goodness.  my friends and i went here for prom & we had 7 people in our group. first of all, they forgot to bring the bread out. also, they charge 5.40 per person if you have a ""group"". the server then threw the bill at my prom date and spilt his water all over him. the food was mediocre as well."
__label__1	"OVERPRICED

We paid $9 for a drink filled with 70% ice in a small 8 oz plastic cup. Shots were $5-6 and diluted with mixers.
Food was fine, but also overpriced. A normal sized portion of nachos with chicken was $15. Burrito was around $14 and smaller than a Chipotle burrito. 

Overall drink. Drinks were awful, overpriced, and not worth it. Drink elsewhere."
__label__1	Absolutely the worst.  They have taken horrible care of my father.  The dentist  leaves a lot to be desired.  He paid in full in March and it's August and they just did yet another impression the day they were supposed to finally put the permanent set in AGAIN because they are as incompetent as they come.  Stay Away.  They have more excuses than results.  Run the other direction.
__label__1	"Can I give zero stars? Manager yelling at employees who can't keep up and now employees yelling back.

Lobby filled with impatient customers and a line backed up in the drive through.  Manager continues to take orders even though it's obvious the staff isn't keeping up! 
I hope we get our food."
__label__1	"First noticed the extremely sticky dirty front counter, then went to go find a seat but was nearly impossible because all of their tables were disgusting. 
Then...went to drink my sweet tea. It was unsweet. Proceeded to go up there to change it out to sweet tea. Still unsweet. Had to go back up to get it changed again.. 
asked for no black olives on spud, had black olives all over spud. 
Probably won't come back. 
Kenner location is better."
__label__1	"I went to this location today to attempt to sell a ""Like New"" set of Taylor Made golf irons, a name brand 3 wood, 4 Hybrid, Callaway driver, Maxfli putter (retail $249), and Slazenger bag. All less than a year old and nearly new. It was about $900 invested. They offered me $116 in store credit or $59 cash. I left, with my clubs."
__label__1	"I wasn't very hungry, so I ordered the Loaded Fries minus the bacon while two people I was with ordered the BBQ Chicken pizza. The cheese on the waffle fries was just melted shredded cheese and pretty gross. The BBQ Chicken pizza was covered in huge chunks of raw onions and it was impossible to actually taste the BBQ sauce as there was so little of it. Very expensive too! Fries, pizza and 3 beers was $40+! 

Never going back."
__label__1	"Dirty.  Dirty.  Disgustingly dirty.
When they say ""melted cheddar cheese"" they really mean nacho cheese sauce.  Someone decided that eggs and ""melted cheddar cheese"" on a bagel would be an appetizing meal.  Really it was awful.

I will say service was relatively quick and our server was friendly and did try to be personable.  The food was just so awful that I can't give this place more than 1 star.  It was not that it was tasteless, but really just bad quality food."
__label__1	Not in convienient locations. They don't have many branches no drive up atms. The service was terrible, they also have very bad customer service and loan operators. They don't care about personal circumstances and have no desire to help you or keep you as a customer. I will never go back to them again and I tell everyone I know my experience and recommend other banks.
__label__1	I walk In and told the guy what was going on with my car and he said let's go look at it. So he walks over to my driver side door and opens it and I told him my fiancé and daughter were in there and he said he is kicking them out of my car. I will never go back to this place. I'm sorry but if you want to test drive someone's car you need to ask them before just helping your self and kicking my family out of my car
__label__1	Worst indian food I ever had not to mention the delivery took a hour when I live 10 mins away. Spice Kitchen or Sultan is far better choice. Stay away.
__label__1	Worst bank ever. Don't do any kind of buisness with them. Managers are horrible and change bank rules at their own convenience.
__label__1	Our party had to eat in three separate shifts as the kitchen/waitstaff messed up our order on three separate instances. Steak was extremely salty & very dry. Vegetables were over cooked. Very disappointing.
__label__1	was disappointed with our lunch . The burger was over cooked. although we were informed that they charbroil the burger it was not med well.  the water they served us was horrible tasting so we were forced to order bottled water . It was $9 !!!!! say what ? Tomato soup tasted like pasta sauce. only plus was their fried pickled. rest of the food was not worth our visit
__label__1	Worst experience! We ordered pick up and received raw chicken and the rattlesnake pasta just was a whole bunch of noodles that didn't belong in the pasta. We called to speak with the manager regarding our order but the manager didn't want to assist and kept us on hold for over 30mins and nothing was done. Do not go to this place because the service is horrible.
__label__1	Not only did they change our flight that we booked as direct. They gave us a FOUR hour layover. Then kept us on the runway for an hour and we missed that connecting flight! We had to be shuttled by car ANOTHER 4 Hours and now are missing our bags! THE cheap rate which came out to more anyways was not worth this mess
__label__1	"Management sucks..they don't care about thier residents at all.  Empty promises. They tow everybody even when parked in designated spots. All they care about is money. Junkies live here. Drug dealing is thier #1. Cops here all the times..stay away
.esp if u have kids"
__label__1	Closed on weekends? Whole place shutting down for good in 1 week? What a joke! They only half ass opened and did a horrible awful job in service and had no new inventory or a building or lot for vehicles. What a shame and waste, now just another eyesore for the city and failed shut down sb business.
__label__1	When i got my food the container for my sesame chocken was brolen and spilled all over the bag and not edible. 1st and last time i order there
__label__1	"Drop off was so slow that I very nearly missed last call.  Then waited 2 hours to get picked up @ TPA but at least I wasn't left at the curb like several others were. Parking lot is non-secured, unlit, and your keys are kept in an unlocked construction trailer. 
Phone number goes to voice mail which is full..... Not funny at all!"
__label__1	"I wish yelp allowed for negative stars, cause this place is horrible. Their menu wouldn't even make it on a taco bell list of items. My stomach hurt the moment I saw their food, and now I'm suffering days after eating it. The waitresses and the hostess were incapable of speech or a smile. Save yourselves the issue of crapping your pants from eating at a mexican restaurant that has never heard of ""chorizo""!!!!"
__label__1	Horrible food.. We were a group of 4 and ordered 4 different dishes and each dish was worse than the other. All we could really swallow down our throats was their complimentary bread. Expensive and horrible food.. Not recommended at all
__label__1	Government inefficiency at its best.  1 person barely working, it's lunch hour.  Wait of 15 people.  I imagine this is what hell is like.
__label__1	The worst pizza I've ever had. The restaurant is dirty and the food is disgusting. The sauce was horrible the cheese was even bad. Never again
__label__1	We attempted to try breakfast here today, but ended up leaving. Not one person greeted us. The waitress told us to sit anywhere, and then proceeded to completely ignore us while she gave her whole life story to another table. Meanwhile, we waited at a wet table without so much as a menu. It was extremely rude, and poor customer service. Someone had to tell the waitress to come to our table, but by then we were ready to leave.
__label__1	The food is awful. I mean really, really low quality crap that tastes like it came out of a frozen tv meal tray. Was staying in the hotel and came here after arriving late night. This is literally the worst food I have ever been served from a commercial establishment. They must just not try because they have captive, one-time customers from the hotel. Take an Uber to a late night diner. Under no circumstance would anyone ever eat here if they actually knew how bad the food is.
__label__1	I'd give Tan Dinh a higher rating but their service is SO TERRIBLE. The food is okay but I seriously can't get over how rude the staff is every freakin time I go.
__label__1	They discriminate against pregnant people. I went in their with my toddler to use the restroom and the staff kicked me out and said I had to find a restroom somewhere else.
__label__1	I Called in to discuss paint and body work! Terry was very rude and unprofessional. You should really take the time to listen to your customers before talking over them and hanging up.
__label__1	"Had a mobile order for 8:15, and it wasn't completed until 8:30. I watched the line go down twice before my order came out. Nothing to alleviate the situation or make it right. 

I got home with my food and it was cold, the rice was undercooked, and the portions were half of what the average chipotle would give me. 

Never thought I'd see the day where I review a fast food restaurant on Yelp but like, come on dude. Try a little harder."
__label__1	This place does not care how dirty their chairs or tables are. Especially for this time we are in. You think places will work harder to keep things clean after each customer
__label__1	this company has finally fulfilled our order after two years,  continuous phone calls, contacting the attorney general, and the locals news channel. do not allow your family or friends to be taken advantage of. this business seeks out business and claims to have been sent by the funeral home.
__label__1	This is a terrible insurance company. I was t- boned by a driver. After dutifully paying my premiums for 11 years, they refused to contact me or do anything with my claim for over 1 and half years. Then finally when I switched insurance companies they said they could only give me 50/50. Then they said after the deductible the amount would be paid towards my loan. I received nothing!! These people are criminals who should not be in business. Worst insurance company ever. Do not use.
__label__1	Food was good, but one particular employee here left me in absolute disgust. The way Erick treated me and my friends was incredibly rude and should not be condoned. I hope I never have to see him again.
__label__1	Out of the Toyota dealerships in our area, this is by far the worst! Service was terrible and slow and the lack of customer service almost makes me want to rethink purchasing a Toyota vehicle in the future.
__label__1	Wasn't a fan. It's nice and big inside but didn't like my meal. I ordered jelopeno (sp?) poppers and they were too heavily breaded and stuffed with too much cheese. I also got a turkey panini and it was ok.
__label__1	"I checked in late and ordered room service. The meal was prompt and tasty. For this 4 stars.
After dinner I showered, put on my pajamas and worked at the desk until 11pm. Totally exhausted, I finally turned back the covers to fall into best. What should I see? Somebody else's skin flakes and hair! The front desk brought me clean sheets so I could make my own bed. NEVER will I stay here again!"
__label__1	I should have known there were reasons this salon and spa was completely empty during prom season. My eyes may have been closed while getting my eyebrows done, however my experience was a living nightmare. The lady who attempted to do my eyebrows got wax STUCK on my skin. After a few failed tries to remove the wax, she got the manager. He was extremely rough when finishing my brows, burned me several times with the wax and did not even offer an apology when he finished. I've been here several times, and the service just continues to decline. I will not go there again.
__label__1	"Stopped eating there after the first month - went several times.  Didn't like it.  Removed it from our list.   Was driving by the other night with the family and thought about giving it ""another try""... probably after 9 months.
If you order fajitas and tell them NO PEPPERS, its because I don't like the taste of peppers.  So, when you make my fajitas and they come out with mixed onions and bell peppers, IT IS NOT OK to just take the sizzling skillet to the back and pick through them to remove the peppers.  Idiots... and goodbye."
__label__1	Food was great, but service was super slow and they totally messed up my billing. Ended up with six  transactions against my card. When I called location to ask for correction the manager on duty took zero accountability and acted like somehow this was my fault. Time for across the board customer service training!
__label__1	Been going here for a while, but after my last visit this past weekend not sure if I will give them a second chance. I ordered the ribeye medium rare with mash potatoes, but after a long wait the food finally came as I cut into the steak it was very obvious that the cook missed part of the ribeye being medium rare. So they decided to make me another one this time the manager brought it out and the ribeye was right but they forgot my mash potatoes so I was 90 percent done with the steak and here comes the mash potatoes ....
__label__1	"All the dishes taste the same. They are all sweet and filled with cream. Nothing Indian about them.

The serving size is ridiculously small compared to similar restaurants and similar pricing in Orlando, Miami, New York, DC etc 

Don't waste your money eating sweet cream  of different color being passed as Indian food !!

This is obviously a rip off for white Americans who don't know any better.

Keep your standards high people !!"
__label__1	Just not good at all. For starters, the bathroom is filthy and thats always a sign that the restaurant is dirty too. Burger was not hot and toppings seemed old. Strawberry Field salad was tiny and not worth the money. Bad attitude overall, probably comes from management on down. No thanks.
__label__1	worst customer service. staff is ill informed about their merchandise and the manager is disrespectful.
__label__1	Prices are way too expensive for what you get. $10 for two of the most mediocre shrimp tacos I have ever had. All this after being funneled down a line like a bunch of confused cattle on the way to slaughter.
__label__1	I walk by every day but never went in because it looks very dirty. The window display desperately needs a cleaning and an update! Maybe try sweeping the sidewalk out front and cleaning the filthy windows
__label__2	Asked for a cheddar roast beef sandwich, they gave me a regular one. Sandwich was way too salty (and I like salty) and cold. Had to toss it. Boyfriend liked his turkey sandwich and hot dog though.
__label__2	"Service was pretty awful- stood at hostess podium for several minutes and waiters just kept walking past. Food just average overall 
And agree with others it's way overpriced. Finally got seated but took a while to get water chips and salsa then even longer wait to order. Beers average price but margaritas range from $8-15 and same for wine and other cocktails. Need for staff or re-training"
__label__2	Excellent service. Spiceless/ sauceless food. Hongos tacos tasted like canned mushrooms in pickled sauce.
__label__2	Service leaves something to be desired. Cooks apparently have a hard time reading orders. Asked for 3 eggs. Got 2. Ketchup bottle on table was bone dry. Brought the wrong toast. Ate half my meal without a drink because the waitress didn't check up on us. I don't expect too much because it's a diner but it's the lack of attention to details that give you 2 stars instead of 5.
__label__2	Their cocktail menu needs to have a better variety of flavor combinations.  They seem really into grapefruit and hibiscus right now.  I've had brunch and lunch here and both meals were mediocre.
__label__2	"The only reason I gave this two, rather than one star, is the staff. The staff here has alway been so nice and helpful. 

Reason for two stars? I stopped by for a cup o joe Togo and ZERO sweetener other than sugar. Which is fine if This is for organic reasons. But this was just a misstep from management- they were waiting on their delivery? I paid for a cup of coffee and could not even drink it and gave it back to the people at the counter. I really feel sorry for the employees."
__label__2	"I was so excited to try this ""great burger joint.""  I went yesterday afternoon.  The wait wasn't that long.  Don't believe the hype.  The burger was not much better than Wendy's, and the fries were not hot and not all that tasty.  The burgers at Copa are much better!!!!"
__label__2	Was so looking forward to eating there, but was so disappointed!  We took an early reservation as nothing else was available, but oddly enough there were plenty of open tables. The waitress rushed us into ordering and throughout our meal. Our bill for the 3 off us was $160 and we were done eating in 45 minutes.  For that kind of money, I expect to have a longer, relaxed  and enjoyable dinning experience!  The lasagna which looked fantastic was heavy and greasy!!  Again, I am so disappointed in Mr. Besh and sadly will not recommend this restaurant or go there again.
__label__2	Is my first time here,  it really looks like a good Irish,  music is just okay,  beer prices is fair,  however when I set at the bar area I noticed the cooler door and not for it's stickers but for the black mold around the door,  Omg when was the last time they cleaned it,  from inside out . I hope it will be clean the next time I try to come back
__label__2	Pretty poor for how much you pay. The ambiance was nice but the food was such a let down. Food can be delicious for cheap and can be delicious for an expensive price, neither is wrong. However, you will leave disappointed with the quality, and they will make sure you leave feeling like your palette isn't refined enough to enjoy this food.
__label__2	"I ordered the vegetable spring roll and chicken pad thai. The spring roll was decent (not the best but definitely not the worst). The chicken pad Thai was just terrible. There was no sauce, no flavor, nothing. Now you're probably thinking ""that can't be completely true"". I'm sorry to tell you that it was in my experience. Maybe other items are better on the menu but if you want to save yourself from a disappointing meal when you've been craving Thai food, please go somewhere else."
__label__2	I stay at Hampton Inn's all across the country and this is by far the worst. Very outdated, called for a wake up call and never got it, paper thin walls. I only stayed here because all the others were booked up. Stay at the days inn nothing else is available.
__label__2	New store and every time is nasty I let the employees know about the garbage and they look at me and say ok but no one did anything to fix that
__label__2	These guys are getting a little too comfortable assuming they're the only game in town.  Was run much better when the owner (not his kids) was there more often.  The guys who are running it are unfriendly, unhelpful and just arrogant.   I'll spend my money at Walkers or go to Flemington and hit Little Brothers any day.
__label__2	"Too many rules...2 for 1 Happy Hour but caveat if you buy a bottled beer they need to open both NOW so it gets to sit around while you down the first?

Their name is listed as  validated parking for the garage but that's only ""valid"" from 10-2????

We won't be back"
__label__2	"The lines for snow tubing were really long and they did not need to be. 

First, they started the 1;00 session late - we were 10th in line and did not get to the rope tow till 1:20. 

The process is completely inefficient - they would let numerous ""hooks"" go up the tow line empty (3 or 4) when there was a line that was waiting 30 to 40 minutes. They could to a whole lot better with the resources they have. 

Very punitive conversations with the crowd.   

Overall not a great experience."
__label__2	The food in my opinion is somewhat alright , it's just very small portions for 12$ and it's under new management so I think there doing the same thing as the last people who ran it , you're better off ordering buffalo wings at the pizzeria they'll give you more for the same price
__label__2	I've been to this location 2 times in the last couple months and was left unhappy both times. Once I ordered two sundaes and got all the way home to realize that one cup had only been filled halfway (only about enough ice cream for two or three bites). Last week I was here and they straight up forgot to give me the fries they charged me for--and the food I did get tasted like nasty old fryer oil. It's no wonder why this drive through is always empty when the Wendy's next door and McDonald's across the street are constantly busy!
__label__2	Beautiful atmosphere and friendly service, but food was Sysco fare. Fried duck and fried oyster tasted exactly the same. Come here to enjoy the patio- don't expect much from the food. If you're on a budget, watch out for the drink ware scam. You buy the glass automatically- you must bring it back to the bar for a refund if you don't want it. Not told this upfront - leaves a bad taste in your mouth in more ways than one.
__label__2	"Maybe the food is better if you dine in. I ordered calamari and a fried Philly roll. The calamari taste like onion rings cooked in fish grease and the sushi tempura batter is ""gummy."" Willing to try again but not as a delivery item"
__label__2	Came here for an epic breakfast.  My BF and I decide we will split a cheesesteak from both Pat's and Geno's.  My verdict goes to Geno's by a slight margin.  The meat was more juicy at Geno's that day.  Plus, the hot sauce will knock your socks off!  Bottom line: neither places serve up good service or a killer sandwich, but it's worth a trip if you've never been.
__label__2	"Nice people, food ok, not great. The Italian Wedding Soup was cold and from a can!  Caesar salad was no better than Wawa.

Note:  This is NOT the same business as the Collegeville Italian Bakery, which is across the street."
__label__2	The anticipation to have Union Station alive once more was somewhat a let down. But the wait times (told 30 mins and it was actually 1 hour and 20 mins wait. Multiple empty tables that could have been pushed together, then along with poor service and just ok food. The prices were above average. Will not recommend your restaurant to anyone.
__label__2	Staff was nice, food was mediocre and boring.....big menu though .... service was terrible. Not much else to say, this place was less than memorable even for bad reasons. Its not the worst but its really not that good....at all.
__label__2	"Nice period setting, includes the staff in period costumes. 

Sausage n sauerkraut appetizer would have been better with less gravy. Was drowning.

Main was double cooked beef in a choux pastry. Should have cooked 3 times. Was still tough. And again, a boat load of gravy drowning everything. 

The free bread, was interesting and tasty. Lucky it was not served with gravy. haha

So go for the ambience, and make sure the gravy is on the side."
__label__2	expensive and couldn't fix part of the job. wish i'd gone with a handyman.
__label__2	My boyfriend had the empanadas they had no taste the to Stoney chips and guacamole were really good I would do that just for the guacamole but nothing else and bring my own tequila the mix for the margarita was a little tart though my steak was okay it could have been better my boyfriend get this scallops they were nothing big I wouldn't go back here for dinner like I said only the guacamole and that was the grapefruit and cramp  which I could probably make myself...the band was good also...
__label__2	Decoration of the place on point but they actually need to have good food. I tried the Deep fried crab cakes.. not that good, the lobster gnocchi, the lobster was way over cooked and the flavor of the sauce was very blend, the tuna tacos were average, last thing that bothers me a lot, is that they don't put salt and pepper on the table, I feel that for a sea food restaurant at least they need to let the dinner season their own food if the kitchen fails to make food right
__label__2	Waited in line for over 30 minutes late night to get a cheesesteak because I've heard they're pretty good. Was really not impressed with the original cheesesteak. Was a bit bland. I tried my friends which was vegetarian and liked it better, which should probably not b the case w/ cheesesteaks. Go elsewhere.
__label__2	The outside decor is nice. However the food is overpriced and very greasy. I could actually see a pile of grease In my enchiladas. The sauce tasted like a soup & lacked authenticity. Be prepared for mosquitos bites unless you bring bug spray! I hope there can be some improvements because I can see potential.
__label__2	Nice atmosphere. Terrible food. My grouper was raw and my mother's shrimp was overloaded with salt.
__label__2	"I didn't get my cheesesteak ""wit whiz"" b/c Cheese Whiz looks disgusting, it's a shade of yellow/orange that isn't found in nature (the thought of which is making my stomach turn right now). I got it with provolone, which i could not taste, the sandwich was dry and tasteless, until the last few bites which was heavily seasoned with heart burn and upset stomach inducing grease. But the fries were good."
__label__2	I'm not a fan of the food here. I was excited when the restaurant was first built but I was skeptical about the food after I watched the workers prepare the food. Therefore, I waited some years before I returned and what do you know; here I am today. The food is not how I wanted it to taste. The food is bland I was disappointed but the employees customer service made up for my disappointment.
__label__2	So it doesn't have to be so rude there... but it's the only one close to the panhandle so I deal whit it. bUT whats the DEAL chipotle??
__label__2	Macaron , blech, weird texture and pistatio flavor tasted moldy. The person behind the counter did refund my money but not very graciously. Hubby had the icecream not the best vegan ice cream we've had, and the price is ridiculous.
__label__2	This airport has to be the most confusing maze I have ever had to go through.  They have been doing construction since forever I can't even remember.  As much as I love to visit home, I hate going to the airport because parking is so expensive, its too crowded, and people are so rude.
__label__2	"Normally I don't post these kind of things but dear God... this was awful. I just bought $130 worth of books and you give me this kind of work? Not to mention you took FOREVER to get the ""cleaning"" done. Crumbs.... water spots.... dried soap specks... I didn't even get air freshener! This isn't sparkling image... this is cubic zirconia. I've been a customer for 11 years and this is the first time I've been this unhappy with you guys."
__label__2	Called Nimble Tree and left 2 messages saying I needed some work done. Never got a call back. I understand that they may not have time to help me right now, but a courtesy call would have been nice, even if it was to say they couldn't help. To me that's bad customer service.
__label__2	Not a fan however very popular. Just no flavor able and expensive. I had 6 dishes off the menu
__label__2	"Pros:
Cheap-$25 no chip
Close to my home

Cons:
My no chip began peeling off within less than a week
There was no cuticle work done

I'd really love to come back due to price and convenience, but it is not acceptable for all my no chip nails to begin to chip and peel within 5 days of a mani."
__label__2	"There is no lunch menu on the weekend. I hate paying dinner prices at noon. This is a deal breaker. Seriously.

I picked the one thing that did not have carrots listed. What arrives? You got it : carrots. The old restaurant trick of using cheap root vegetables to ""fill out"" the plate."
__label__2	"If you need a brick of regret to stick into your gut, you might as well choose McDonald's.  At least the drive-thru people don't think twice about serving you, even if you're dangerously fat.  

This particular location has odd hours - not a 24 hour drive-thru.  Lobby closes at different times during the week, drive-thru generally at 11pm, later on the weekends.  At least the people are friendly and nonjudgmental about my horrible eating habits."
__label__2	The food could be better. Not what I had expected. The crab cakes was burnt. The food took forever to come out. Service okay, the staff gave off an awkward vibe. From the hostess to the waiters. The mussels and fries however, were great. Menu was simple with not much of a selection. Overall, I will not be returning to this new neighborhood tavern.
__label__2	The menu was far to lengthy and the the menu items are expensive. The food was just O.K. I had a gift card and I'm glad I used it up because I do not plan on going there again to dine.
__label__2	I love Chipolte, and what you get, but this one is stingy.  I've been there multiple times and I'm left wondering when rice and beans became so expensive, because the servings are tiny.  Additionally, I've gotten the steak twice at this location and it's been chewy - gross.  This Chipolte is worth skipping.
__label__2	We went there for a ls event and had been forewarned that the hotel was pretty rundown.  And it was.
__label__2	"Everybody in Santa Barbara says this is the best deli. It's not even a deli, being from New York I know what a deli is. This place that charges nearly ten dollars for a panini that's not even on terranova bread but instead on simple white bread, doesn't deserve all the awards for ""best sandwich"". The best part is they charge $1.25 PER COOKIE. A small two inch cookie worth $1.25? you're out your mind!"
__label__2	This is by far the worst Ijji location!! I will never go back and have attempted to avoid this place intentionally. Ijji 3 is a completely different experience and blows this dump out of the water... I learned my lesson, no more Ijji 1. Yuck, shit, and hell no is how I describe my last experience there
__label__2	Weak and runny açaí bowl at NYC price. Maybe my expectations were off, but I've had many a better açaí bowl.
__label__2	My husband and I were quite disappointed with this hotel.  Staff was friendly and the hotel was in a good location, but it was nothing special.  The room needed a deep cleaning and the decor was very boring (compared to other boutique hotels).  I expected it to be more like a Kimpton.  The rooms definitely made it feel like it was an old hotel that they had done a few updates to.  Friends staying in nearby hotels had nicer rooms, better amenities and were still within walking distance of Broadway and all the areas that could be walked to.  It was our first and last time at an Indigo hotel.
__label__2	"Terrible. Second time at the restaurant  and the place lost any luster it might have had. 

Ribeyes were cheap and thin, the filet was stringy (gross).

Service was poor and uninterested in how we were doing.

Crab beignets were awesome, however.

Very disappointed and a ruined evening."
__label__2	Would have loved to try this place called for delivery. I was told we don't deliver to that area.  I put the address into my gps it's only 7 minutes away. I was staying at a hotel in the local area.
__label__2	Ordered an arrangement from Proflowers for a coworker.  Delivered late by Petal Pushers and it looked NOTHING like the Deluxe arrangement I'd paid for!  Outraged, I contacted Proflowers for a replacement with another florist.
__label__2	"This so called ""Christian"" company leaves alot to desire with their cursing employees.  Owner speaks to his employees like they are second class citizens too, so I'm not surprised at the employees behavior when he's not around harrassing them.  I don't care how good your service is,  when you falsely advertise yourself as a Christian company."
__label__2	Why are so many places to eat in Sparks so dysfunctional? We waited 45 minutes for two tostadas and ceviche. Had to chase down the wait staff for the bill and now we are waiting and waiting and waiting for them to run our card so we can leave. A lot of service problems here. The food was fine nothing that spectacular that made the wait worth it-
__label__2	I ordered through Uber eats on 8/12.  I was craving a buffalo chicken sandwich so decided to order.  The chicken was tough and chewy, and did not appear to be cooked through.  I also got some boneless wings.  Unfortunately these weren't much better.  I decided not to eat any of the food and tossed it in the bin.  Two stars, because it's understandable things can go wrong.
__label__2	This is not one of the better locations they literally are paying for twice the amount of square footage for no reason.  Shelves are always half empty I don't like this location I wouldn't come here unless I had to.  Not to mention service is slow there's just one person on the register and she looks like she's half-asleep.  This store is definitely a thumbs down
__label__2	"Painful. Waiter Jake(the ginger?) was apologetic of the kitchen. Two and a half hours for lunch?!?!
People beside us ordered Marcona almonds and olives. It took 45 minute. That's insane! Work on your kitchen so you don't go out of business because of them. Food was great waiter was great.
Kitchen sucked."
__label__2	This place looks fabulous and I really wish the food wasn't mediocre.  It is plated in a pretty manner, but unless you order oatmeal, it can be not hot when it arrives at your table.  I will say that the bacon is amazing (thick cut) and forced me to order butcher-cut bacon for my house, to see if I could even come close.
__label__2	My boyfriend and I come here about once or twice a month(only because it's his favorite restaurant). Every time I order something there is either hair or ALUMINUM FOIL in my food. Their food options aren't that great, and I think we've only had 3 good servers in the past 4 years.
__label__2	I have had their tamales several times at different events I have attended. I love tamales but I am not sure what the hype is....I always think I will like them but I never do...and too much masa...and dry..disappointed.
__label__2	Not a great meal here. Food was just ok at best. Was really disappointed. I was really excited to try this place. Pasta over-cooked and sauce bland. Veal was blah. Clams casino were horrible. Good desert. Service was good and wait staff was pleasant but can't recommend and won't be back. So many better places out there wouldn't want to waste my time here.
__label__2	is it me, or has this place gone waaay down?  either its really crowded with assholes, or midly crowded with assholes.  takes forever to get a drink.  not enough bathrooms.  predicable music.  blah blah blah.
__label__2	Service was extremely slow on a week night. The jalapeño strawberry margarita was flavorless and the smoked chicken salad tasted like old chicken salad mixed with runny mayonnaise that was then placed over a bed of lettuce. Very unfortunate to have poor service and mediocre food for such a great location.
__label__2	We had dinner here this evening and wasn't happy with the service at all. Took so long to get our drinks, food, and everything else. Took almost 20 minutes to just get cheese. This location never again.
__label__2	The staff was nice and accommodating.  We waited for a carry out pizza.  It simply wasn't good.  $18 for a medium 2 topping pizza, that looked and tasted like a bad frozen pizza.
__label__2	Took my car here to be inspected and they tried to get me to spend $300 to change the inside door lock.  The only thing wrong with it was that I sometimes had to press it twice to lock it, but it worked.  In fact now that I have been testing it, it has started working perfectly again for a while.
__label__2	"Price point is great but food itself is just so so. We ordered three fishes between the two of us: pork spring roll vermicelli Bun, papaya. Pork shrimp salad and the flank steak, brisket tendon pho. 

The bun lacked the requisite shredded cucumbers, daikon. The spring roll was not crispy. The bun dish was sloppily put together. 

The sprouts and basil that normally accompanied the pho was not fresh-- limp and yellow. Broth had a bit too much msg."
__label__2	Not recommended as a place for a first date .The music was loud and it is was difficult to carry on a conversation.
__label__2	"Went and tried this particular location and was not surprised on why there are numerous low rating reviews here.
 First problem here is the staff running the place. The order taker couldn't have been more senseless of what do to do and he didn't even know what was on their menu which was right behind him !  The place was also pretty empty so there was no reason the wait was 25 minutes. Food quality was sub par and seemed rushed together. For the prices there it is simply not worth the return business."
__label__2	Steak, shrimp & chicken & rice skewers were so dry it made me thirsty! My friends fish & chips, & the sliders were good! My chocolate sundae was ok...but the ice cream tasted like everything in the freezer
__label__2	"I realize the virus could have an impact on service, etc. but does this look like a tuna melt to you? Got this when they were doing takeout only, but is that an excuse?
A few weeks ago, ordered Asian Chicken salad, only to find, when I got home, they forgot to add the chicken.  I'm giving two stars because they get it right about 40% of the time."
__label__2	The food and prices are average... But there are a lot of better options in the greater Nashville area. My real problem is not so much with the food, but rather with the service... most of the time it take forever to get your order taken once your are seated and a drink refill seems to be a miracle act. So if you are nearby and want a quick lunch this is a good place to grab a bite, however just do not go thirsty...
__label__2	Pizza has been very inconsistent. When it's good, it's great but last few times not so great. Place is not big enough for social distancing adequately but they cram people in anyway (employees and customers dining and waiting for carryout). Will not go back until after CoV.
__label__2	"owner very rude
dirty smelling bathroom
lunch special pizza was old tasting
dry 
will Never go back"
__label__2	"The food was decent, but the service sucked. The bathroom was also unclean.
Might come back for decent ice cream, but certainly not to sit in and eat. We felt rushed to eat, rushed to pay and rushed to leave.

Also, the staff wanted to know the tip before we were even done eating. Very annoying."
__label__2	Went to this location for the first time today. Was throughly disappointed with the quality of the food. I ordered the 14oz rib eye and I should have saved myself $25 and had just gone down the street to Outback. The quality for the price is not in alignment. Never had a chance to share my thoughts with anyone because no one bothered to ask how my food was once served, during the meal, or after. Don't think I will return. Eddie V's is way better.
__label__2	The food wasn't horrible, but it was horribly overpriced. We paid like 20 bucks for 3 tacos that were just boring taco's. Not enough options. Maybe I want an Enchilada, and at that price point, chips and salsa on the house.
__label__2	Straight ass. Food was okay but seating sucked. Potatoes were frozen. Brother known formerly as Sam Johnson had undercooked sausage. Service was rather poor. Would not recommend
__label__2	There buffet here does not have much variety, even though the price is decent, there should be better cooked food. The people there are much nicer than expected, but the food overall is not that great.
__label__2	The service here was terrible. We came in for dinner around 7:00 and were one of the only parties in the restaurant. Our waitress hardly checked on us and we had to wait over ten minutes to simply ask for a bottle of ketchup after our food came out. The food is simply mediocre, basic bar food. The live music was a nice touch.
__label__2	Tanning is horrible at Planet Fitness in Roxborough.  There are two tanning beds.  One of which has a face tanner that has been broken for weeks.  The staff can't give you an answer as to when it will be repaired.  The tanning rooms are grubby and need to be thoroughly cleaned.  Good luck finding a staff member when you want to tan early in the day.
__label__2	Lazy service. Took 45 minutes to get my food, and no checking on my water in that time. Meanwhile, some regulrs seated near us were doted on constantly. Food was decent, nothing spectacular. Ordered enchillada and taco combo.
__label__2	Really rude and uninviting wait staff. Poor bus girl was the only nice friendly person and seemed like she was running around doing all the work while her superior (a posh man with a mini mohawk) seemed to only be interested in his after work glass of wine. Beef was lacking flavor for 17$.have had some stellar dishes and some kinda ehh. Would still be 4 stars without the bad vibes
__label__2	It was okay in comparison to Pho places. Not a place that's really service oriented but they do have an expansive food menu. Not really any veggie options. They had ran out of tofu the night I went. The Pho is also okay but there meat options aren't bad.
__label__2	Foods pretty good,  however manager style is questionable.   The Sunday before labor day 9/4/2016 we went there at 8.30 pm and upon entering the door the manager said their closed/last call.  According to their sign/website their operating hours are until 9pm.  Note 1/2 hour before their advertised closing time.  So we walkout and saw a couple entering and we told them their closed (8.31pm).  What a disappointment.  I guess they don't need my business!  Going to Bonjung from now on.
__label__2	"I am so disappointed in this nail salon.  It used to be my favorite place.  Because they want to sell the more expensive pedicures they no longer seem to keep the complete price list at the pedicure station.  They only seem to want you to buy the $55.00.  If I ask for anything below the $40.00 pedicure they seem to get offended.  I feel pushed to purchase other services when all that I want is a pedicure.

The quality of the pedicure itself is also inconsistent.  Sometimes it is ok but more often then not recently it is not."
__label__2	Small portions of food well out of proportion to the high prices listed on the menu feature prominently here.  This is hipster and idealist central.  Three Boars Eatery is nice enough, but I think the value for money it offers is poor and I will not return for that reason alone.  It is a nice addition to the area; it is just not for me.
__label__2	"The good: the ladies behind the counter are really pleasant and the storefront looked clean.
Although its pricey, the portion is pretty large. 
The not so good: I ordered the loaded wedges and added the chicken bites. 
Am disappointed to say that I didn't enjoy it at all. There was no seasoning on the potatoes and the chicken bites were either chewy or too hard bite into and enjoy. Just all around bland. 

I'd try this place again for the waffles sometime but I'd forgo the wedges."
__label__2	"I *LOVE* to drink beer here, but I am not impressed with their food.  I have been here about a dozen times and every menu item I have had, besides the hummus, has been truly underwhelming.  

They really have to improve their menu or they will begin to lose customers...maybe not tomorrow, but nothing lasts forever..."
__label__2	Wow a $10 hotdog and service that STINKS. I do understand its not that fun to serve hot dogs but at least be nice. The hot dog tasted like any other hot dog........... Save your money/
__label__2	Our room was really nice and I loved the huge bathroom! They had a nice Kuerig coffee maker as well. Over all beautiful room, however one feature was off. The hotel doesn't have heat. I fumbled with the thermostat for 20 minutes before giving up and calling the front desk. I was then informed that the hotels ventilation system is older so the only feature available was AC. It has been 4 hours since then and I'm still currently laying in this bed-which is nice and comfy-cold.
__label__2	mediocre thai, you will find better at Thai Town in dunedin
__label__2	Called up an order after finding the online menu. My order was ready when I arrived. Paid with my charge card and I thought the price was a little higher than I saw when I ordered. Got home and checked the website and yes, I was over-charged (not by much but overcharged). So I called and their answer was it wasn't their website. Their phone number, their trademark, their address, not their website.  It's 2013 and that excuse doesn't cut it. The food? Better off elsewhere.
__label__2	Very sad to see that Andy isn't there anymore, luckily I found him at Casabella nails in the Costco shopping center!!!
__label__2	New nachos are terrible they need to go back to the old ones that were awesome. Hopefully they change back before March madness.
__label__2	I ate here with my family of four and everyone was disappointed in their meals. Food was bland and chicken was overcooked. My platter was supposed to come with rice and mixed vegetables and instead I got plain chicken and rice with a bowl of soup.
__label__2	"I've gotten oil changes and minor work done from them. During my last visit they did not keep proper records which caused some problems. 
I will check out some other local places."
__label__2	I give it two stars because it is a Mexican restaurant. I find no differences between these restaurants and I believe they get all of their food from the same sources. I recommend the veggie fajitas since they won't make you sick.
__label__2	Nice atmosphere and friendly staff.  The quality of the food was not so good.  The sushi was so so and so was the hot and spicy shrimp, but the chicken and broccoli was so bad that we had to send it back.  The quality of the chicken itself made me wonder where it came from.
__label__2	Tried to have dinner here a few weeks ago and the kitchen was already closed at 10pm. Weird for a bar. Also, walked by today and they are temporarily byo. Strange things are afoot at Kennett it seems.
__label__2	I've only been here once for lunch, but I would not recommend the meatballs. It was only 2 small meatballs in a mountain of gravy. My dad said his dish was ok. I might try it again one day.
__label__2	Took our cocker spaniel here and it took them three attempts to wash and give her a haircut needless to say poor thing was so scared when I got her back we opted to not bring her back.
__label__2	Stopped in the other day to grab a few cupcakes because my friend said she heard the cupcakes were good. They were small for the price and the cupcake fell apart like in half when I was eating it. It tasted alright, but it's not something I forsee myself going back for in the future.
__label__2	I came here with two friends on a Saturday night. We tried going to other restaurants, but they were all packed. Surprisingly, there was no one in this restaurant, so we decided to stop in. The interior was tiny, but cute. The service was friendly, but inattentive. She seemed more worried about takeout orders than our table. The food was average at best. Nothing special, except for their cheap prices. I probably won't be coming back unless I'm stuck with nowhere to go.
__label__2	Ever heard of the Soup Nazi from Seinfeld? Well, we just met the Pizza Nazi! We ordered ahead of time so as not to wait... 45 minutes later we were still waiting. To add insult to injury we had to listen to the Pizza Nazi screaming first at his daughter, then at his wife, then at his coworker!  By the time we left I felt like I had PTSD! I would have given this one star but husband thought the pizza was good. But he also said its not worth the trauma...we won't be back.
__label__2	When we swiped the hotel sheets dust came out. There was hair and black stuff in the shower, the chair in the room had rubber bands and crumbs in it . The only good thing they have here is customer service
__label__2	Very slow service.  Average food.  Good place to watch football. That's the only reason I gave it 2 stars vs 1 star.
__label__2	I feel this place is over priced for what you receive.  The technicians are lovely, but I don't feel you get your monies worth.  I've never had a pedicure where a bucket is filled w/ water nor a manicure where the technician must hold the ultraviolet light in her hands over my nails since the light is tempermental & won't work otherwise.  Very cramped space.  Not worth the money.
__label__2	Ok at best. Sole service. Food so so. Not going back. Yelp wants me to write more. So.  Food ok. Service slow
__label__2	I have been a regular since they opened, and on my last visit was so disappointed by the fries (which used to be the BEST in St Louis) that I sent most of them back to the kitchen. They tasted of being frozen and if not we're at least hard and cold. I LONG for the days when a plate of fries (with dipping sauces -- stated on the menu, though you still have to ask for them) was to DIE for ...
__label__2	This M.A.C. was super busy the whole day. They need to extend their hours or hire more people. People greeted us but no one was able to help us so we left to come back later, it was still busy but they closed the store down. Ughh frustrating and we wanted to spend money too. Shame.
__label__2	I will happily edit my reveiw at a later time, for now I'm highly aggravated. For the last week, both my husband and I have been calling and leaving messages to have our items delivered. Every number I find for the company,  no one answers and they all lead to the same general voicemail. I would just like to have my belongings, some very important items that no amount of money could replace!
__label__2	"Mahi Mahi dry and fishy--not salvaged by any sauce. ""Sushi"" grade Ahi tuna dry and grey (not fresh). Albariño was flat and uninspiring. Deserts were fair to middling. Service was terrific but didn't balance out the disappointedly lackluster food. Fish house should easily be able nail the fish."
__label__2	I would never recommend this place and never go again! The manicure was messy..the callus removal left me with a scratch on the inside of my foot.  an employee was watching a video with audio on that competed with a loud tv and radio.  I left with nasty looking nails and a massive headache
__label__2	"I used to be a regular at this wing stop and had some great wings  but my experience has gone downhill due to watching kitchen staff gross me out with how they prepared food  I had a head manager reach out to me and gave me a free meal for my next time and I came back to give them another try and ended up having a worse experience on the trip back 
I've decided to get my wings elsewhere"
__label__2	Excellent Pizza But Filthy place. Cannot believe they have not been shut down yet.  They must have rats and bugs because it is absolutely filthy.  I was in twice in a week and saw the same pizza dough that must have fallen still under the oven.    THE PLACE IS GROSS
__label__2	"Not bad but their regular pizza is ""Fake Pizza"" I have come to the conclusion that Boise residents have French fry taste buds, and I will no longer be enticed by 4&5 star reviews. That being said the dining area was nice also clean."
__label__2	"""VILE""

""It's like f'd up kool-aid you never want to drink again.""

""1 part water, 3 parts blue food colors, 1 part sugar."""
__label__2	It is so sad what the cafe has turned into.  There is NOTHING ever available for purchase besides soups.  They used to be full of delicious sandwiches, salads, yogurts etc for a quick grab and go.   The guy that works there is fabulous and the girl that works there is so nice.  Not sure  why they decided to stop selling food from the cafe.  Not everyone has the time for a sit down lunch.  They do still have their home made iced tea which I love but that seems to be it besides soups and pretzels in the morning.
__label__2	"Food was decent quality.  Portions ridiculously small.  Siu Mai was cold and fishy, but $15 for 5 pieces.  Wtf?  FOOD IS WAY OVERPRICED.
Terrible dessert options.  Wouldn't come again if you paid me.  Just go to Hong Kong diner across the street for better, cheaper food.

Only giving 2 stars because our server was great."
__label__2	I'm not certain how this place has so many great reviews. Yes, the service was quick and friendly, but the food had no flavor. I mean NO flavor. We ordered a variety of items including beef shawarma, spinach pie, beef kabob, and falafel. We were disappointed to say the least. If you are interested in some flavorful food, try the Halal Guys down the road.
__label__2	Not great tasting chicken, with the skin just peeling off while in the bucket before I could even grab my first piece. The sides were ok. Biscuits are always good. But something about their traditional recipes were off.
__label__2	I ordered the east nasty which fit it's name perfectly.  The biscuit was dry, the gravy had no flavor and the fried chicken was gristle filled and slimy. I was so excited to finally be able to eat here, instead I had food I didn't even eat more than two bites from and a waste of 10 dollars.  Maybe it was an off day, but that fried chicken was so bad it almost ruined chicken for me!!!
__label__2	This place is a real whatever, who gives. Who's writing all these rave reviews?
__label__2	I'd been looking forward to going here for quite some time. I was not impressed. The staff was ok, and the restaurant lovely, but the food was not worth the $180 the 3 of us paid. The $30(!!!) salmon was plain, the vegis had little spice, and I left their parched (no one filled our water). I had a lovely time with my friends but I won't be going back any time soon. I don't get the hype.
__label__2	"We came here for lunch.  We ordered a steak salad which was so bad that most of it went untouched.  We also ordered the grilled cheese burger to share.  This is definitely a case of ""sounds better than it is.""  It tasted pretty much like a burger with too much bread.  I think a regular burger would have been better, but it was grossly overcooked and the 1/ 2 I shared was still too much.  Service was ok, but nothing remarkable."
__label__2	Awful pizza. I was so disappointed when I called Queens and this restaurant had replaced it. Claiming your pizza is NY style should be a crime when it's NOT and it's this bad. I'll try some of their other food, but the pizza was so bad we threw it out.
__label__2	"Our friends and I went to Cosi for a Panini. Just happened to see a roach run across the counter. We quickly left, and never looked back. What really astonished me is how everyone else just stayed there and laughed at the incident; I guess infestation is funny. 

Another note, the Wifi is hardly working most of the time. I suggest Barnes and Nobles for study groups."
__label__2	"The parts department is horrible... It's not as simple as ordering and getting parts put on. Something always ""comes up"" with them."
__label__2	"This place is OK for what it is - typical home cooking buffet.  Very popular among the retired community.

Salad bar, dessert bar, tacos, nachos, salisbury steak, baked chicken, fried chicken, burger sliders, mac and cheese, chicken fettucine alfredo, corn, baked potatoes, fried fish, etc."
__label__2	Tried it for the first time this week. We ordered a cheesesteak and a pizza with toppings. The cheesesteak was awesome. Really really good cheesesteak. We would not get the pizza again. It really wasn't good and I'm sorry to say that. Nice place, nice people, and we would order from there again... just not the pizza.
__label__2	"The Nashville style wings are good and cheap. better than BWW standard wings.

However, DO NOT order their sandwiches and hoogies, they look so sad and ugly and bad tasting."
__label__2	"By far the SLOWEST service I've ever gotten. There was only six people in front of us when we walked in and we waited over 30 minutes just to get ice cream. Not to mention there was 4 workers ""working"" and it was still that slow. My ice cream was melted by the time I sat down. Cold stone? More like hot stone."
__label__2	Not impressed with this place!!! Don't even know why they feature it on tv really, that hungry for business. Not friendly at all first of all guess all the publicity gettin to their heads. The sandwich was greasy, cut of meat was horrible. The only thing I tasted was the cheez whiz cuddos to that which they don't make (store bought). I will pass on this one consider my $9 bucks a donation.
__label__2	"We were told to sit down while they got our table ready, in a pretty empty restaurant!

Then our table had two starter menus, no dinner menus, and only two water glasses for four of us.

On top of that, we had to call them over to provide us with proper menus and fill our two glasses of water.

Very disappointing service."
__label__2	Went there on a Saturday night. Seemed okay for a bit, Until... I watched a guy punch another guy in the face and break out all his teeth directly in the middle of the Bar. The people working didn't do anything about it or even notice the fight took place. So for about 10 or 15 minutes there was a guy walking around in a white tall-T covered in blood before EVENTUALLY being escorted out by bouncers that found him in the bathroom (Creepy). Institute a dress code!.. Felt a little unsafe there.
__label__2	"This place is terrible. I usually do not write reviews. I was very disappointed. The food has no flavor. Also the atmosphere at the restaurant is bad.

I had the tuna in lettuce cups...bland
boudin tamale, sounds amazing...bland
deviled eggs, again flavorless. 

There are so many other great places to go that have better service and better food. I would skip this one"
__label__2	Been waiting over an hour for our meal. Just found out there's a big party in the room next door that's why the kitchen is backed up. Manager said he would comp our entire meal.
__label__2	Everything was great until I found a hair in my plate. I informed my server and she did not seem pleased. Gave me snotty attitude and continued to do so for the rest of the dinner. Other than that, food was great and drinks are fantastic!
__label__2	Not good that you raised your prices. You're supposed to be on the cheaper more affordable side, so I was unpleasantly surprised when I saw your prices today. The tofu curry wrap did not carry the kick it used to about two years ago when the price was more justifiable and the taste better. Especially for take out, prices should reflect that. I'd rather order from a local deli than spend extra to eat a relatively meh wrap. Disappointed after going for a while. Stop by the various delis or bagels shoppes for well-affordable and tastier sammies.
__label__2	Really nice sales person. I came in to check out mattresses and I was just being sent around trying to be sold on a deal, the first one was the most expensive when all I wanted was to try out different mattresses at my own time. I had to run out when the sale person walked away from a moment. Frustrating experience, never coming back here unfortunately.
__label__2	Ordered for the first time & not very happy. We ordered the dinner for two with wonton soup. Beef stir fry had no flavour at all. & on top of that the fried rice had a hair in it! Completely ruined my appetite. When we brought the food upstairs there was a distinct smell of cigarette smoke from the food very unappetizing aswell.. the only reason I added a second star was because the wonton soup tasted amazing but it was also very small, definitely not enough for 2 people.
__label__2	Where do I start. The line was enough to let me know only minors and minors, they have two dudes working one bar (which if you work in the industry, know that's a no no). Most the crowd is 16-20 although they say it's an 18 and up bar. They offer free pizza to throw off the fact that real food isn't served and if you get too drunk don't worry they won't try to sober you up with any good treats.
__label__2	"I've been wanting to try this place after all the hype. The whole peacock thing is way over done and the decor overall would work in Miami. 

I had the cheeseburger, are you serious? It's like a cheeseburger slider. The taste was ok, i want a burger. I really don't see anything special about this place. 

Nice try"
__label__2	Been here 2x and the food was good but the service really sucks. That alone makes me not want to go again and I dont think I will. On the other hand, Ive been to the Pho restaurant on Hollister near Hope Ave and the food and service was great!!
__label__2	The ladies that did my Mani/pedi and my Brazilian wax. But to do my nails took very long time. I was there for 3hrs. Some of which I had my Brazilian wax. I as a cosmetologist know what wax works and should be used. The wrong wax was used because the owner is too cheap to buy the wax their esthetician actually wants.
__label__2	I don't get it. The crab cake was deep fried and flavorless. The slices of lamb loin were covered in a bbq sauce--the natural flavor of the lamb could not be tasted.
__label__2	My husband and I decided to have dinner there one night, we had the steak fajitas and it was nothing special.  The meat was really tough and not cut into strips like they should have been, they were big thick pieces and it was hard to eat.  The rice and beans we got with it were rather bland too.  I did enjoy the house margherita I ordered, but would have enjoyed Chili's fajitas a lot more
__label__2	"I must confess that I ate here on my last trip to town because it was across the street from my hotel and a rainy night.  Sadly this random choice was a disappointment.  I had the new orleans ""taste"" plate that included gumbo, jambalaya and etouffe.  The gumbo I have perfected at home had more flavor.  It was fast and the service was good but the food was average."
__label__2	Ordered a pizza and salad to go.  Pizza placed in a box and then I had to wait for a salad so the pizza got cold.  Pizza was under cooked, some cheese barely melted.  service was ok not a lot of personality here.
__label__2	Both service and food have gone down in the last few years. Not worth going back.
__label__2	"I have a feeling this place mostly operates on gimmick and trendiness, instead of actual food quality. It was busy when we went, so I took that into account when writing this review. When I order a breakfast skillet, I expect it to be hot, maybe even sizzling. Instead it was room temp, and cold after a few bites. It was also pretty bland. The coffee was also cold as soon as it was poured, and my first cup was the only cup, as I never received a refill. 

Overpriced, bland, cold food."
__label__2	Love the store, brands and prices but the girls who work here are really just awful. Ugh bitchy and not very nice. Probably will keep me from coming back.
__label__2	Have been going to Carrabba's in AZ and IL for a couple of years. Usually get the Chicken Bryan.  Have noticed it seems to have shrunk since I first started ordering it.  Also seems to have more cartilage.
__label__2	Food was pretty good, but the service at the to go counter left a lot to be desired.  Very slow with no sense of urgency or particular concern.
__label__2	"Not a fan, but it is exactly what you pay for. If you are looking for a cheap meal for a couple of dollars then this is your place. 

I ordered a beef item (forgot particularly what it was) and my fiancé ordered some chicken tacos. She said the tacos were tacos nothing special. My item just simply tasted weird. The meat quality you could tell wasn't the best ended up stopping after a couple bits and throwing it away. 

I wouldn't come back unless I wasn't sober perhaps lol."
__label__2	I ordered the Bulgoji, Tacos and 8 Garlic Wings. The Bulgoji was great. I liked that they doubled the soft taco to avoid sogginess. Those damn wings were horrible. They were old and dried out. I was so effin mad because two weeks ago the wings were slammin. I referred people based on the wings. I'm so very disappointed and will not order from them again.
__label__2	Over priced and bad quality of food. Came here when it first opened and didn't like it. I decided to try it again but still the same. I have made burrito bowls better in my own kitchen. Will not return.
__label__2	Slow service waited 20 minutes for a drink sat in a side room where I had to listen to a car alarm. Overpriced fried food
__label__2	This car wash used to be really good at the beginning, now I don't know if they got cheap but the last 6 times I have went over there I choose their most expensive wash and for some reason my car gets cleaned with dirty water , my car is left with a whole bunch of dirty water marks... I tried them one last time and I had to use a bottle of water to wipe down the vehicle and a baby wipe to clean the mirror .  Please don't go here
__label__2	"I have to be honest, my SO, her best friend and myself did not enjoy the food or restaurant. We ordered our food and it took 40 minutes for the food to come out. Two tables who came after us were served before we were and we didn't order much at all.

I had the Fried Shrimp Sandwich, the Shrimp was good but the bread almost broke my teeth when I bit into it. So I just ate the shrimp, fries and left the bread on the plate. The bananas from the Banana pudding was over cooked as well. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant."
__label__2	"We ordered a 12"" chicago style cheese pizza. Was told the wait would be 45 mins, got there in 46 and rushed back to the house to eat, didnt even bother checking the food. We got a 12"" pan style cheese pizza (still was charged for the chicago style) with undercooked dough and the pizza had cold spots throughout. The sauce was good but honestly, reading the reviews, I expected a lot more than what we got. I'm too antisocial to actually call and complain so this is the most I'll do, in case you were wondering."
__label__2	Women love superior. I'll crush the chips and salsa. But too damn pricey for mediocre at best food.
__label__2	"I was so excited when I realized that I signed a lease so close to an Aldi location, but after 2 trips there, I can't see myself coming back unless there's a really spectacular seasonal home item on sale.

The first time I was there, the cashier forgot to ring up one of my items that I literally spoke to her about while she was ringing me up they chased me back into store. The second time I was there, I literally spent 15 minutes in a line.

This is an unpleasant and disappointing location. It's a shame because the store looks great from its exterior."
__label__2	Sad...went for sushi lunch. Use to be good...fish was old. Rolls are tiny. Won't be back.
__label__2	Don't bother wasting your time! They are never on time with the food, and the quality is mediocre! I do Grubhub part time and every time I go in the orders are never ready and they are extremely RUDE and very unprofessional!
__label__2	"Stopped in here for the first time because it was close.  The ""breakfast special"" is cheap, so you get what you pay for.  It was very bland and not good.  The apple fritter i had was stale. My daughter had a regular glaze which was fine. The servers are very nice. They charge and extra fee for a CC transaction. I probably wont ever return."
__label__2	Went here the other day and they had no AC on one of the hottest days of the year.  They had no sign nor did they tell us during or after our order.  My daughter finally went to our car to cool down.  The food has gone down hill since they remodeled and so has the service.  We use to enjoy going here, now I do not think I will be going back.
__label__2	"Poor service, food average-server made an error on my order, then tried to charge me extra for the error. When I pointed out the issue, she hesitated and said, ""I'll see what I can do."""
__label__2	Stopped in for lunch a few days ago after hearing good things about this place. I ordered a burger with sweet potato fries and a fountain drink. My order cost $12 and change. One nice thing I can say is that the place is clean and the employees are very kind. Other than that, The food  was mediocre at best. The fries lacked taste and the burger needed better seasoning. I was not impressed and will not return.
__label__2	Competent arborists..billing and scheduling is messed up..looking for another company
__label__2	I've had local taco before via uber eats and always enjoyed it. However, going there in person was another story. Waited 4 minutes to be sat, even though multiple employees walked by, and then sat for 18 minutes without being asked for drinks or anything. This was after a server came up, asked to wipe our table off, then said he'd be back. He proceeded to clean a large table off while another server waited 2 tables ON EITHER SIDE OF US!!! We ended up walking out.
__label__2	Attempting to be fancy. The food wasn't horrible but was only fancy in plating and lacked complex flavors from what its atmosphere was attempting. Service was poor. If you want to try being fancy but don't normally go to high end restaurants then you will love it.
__label__2	Sushi was okay--Happy hour sushi. I wasn't thrilled with the service.  I believe I should never have to ask for a napkin while dining in a restaurant -- but had to ask and and twice for a glass of water.
__label__2	The server and management tried to compensate for very disappointing items. Way over priced for what you get for breakfast. You could run up $20 for coffee/tea and toast and juice --- and you would not be happy with the food.    It's a convenient location but there are better options a short walk away.
__label__2	So let me start by saying the only reason I went to this place was because I Saw it got a complete makeover staff and Resturant by Gordon Ramsey.  Well Gordon would be disappointed.  Staff was friendly with an edge if that makes any sense. They were pleasant to customers but walked away from tables and the kitchen mumbling and talking mess about one thing or another. We happen to be sitting near the kitchen by the bar, which had a container on it to catch the dripping rusty looking water that was falling from the ceiling. As for the food , it was just ok nothing special. Won't be returning !
__label__2	Went on Saturday night around five. Found service to be slow and had to wait for our check to long. I ordered the eggplant parm and spaghetti and the waiter asked if I wanted garlic bread which I said yes. I was charged five dollars for bread which I assumed was included with the meal. The entree came with bread which he didn't tell me. I have had dinner here before and had a pleasant experience.
__label__2	Ya. Not a lot of good to say about this place. I ordered a beer and it definitely came in a dirty glass so that was a great start. The burger I ordered was below the average Big Mac At $14. I would recommend going down to grounded for some food and grabbing a drink here. Just make sure it comes in a clean glass!!
__label__2	To hear good things about a place and then get what I received is .. disappointing to say the least. They must not care about their to-go people at all. Cold old coffee, raw hashbrowns & missing biscuits ANDDD overcooked eggs? Only thing that was good was the Turkey Sausage. Paid 30+ for food that was not cooked and left me Un-satisfied. Waffle House treats me better & is cheaper smh
__label__2	toilet leaking, someone else's hair on my pillow and shower, bad toilet-door configuration/layout... service was just ok -- not bad. they were charging the full 24hr fee eventhough we only had parked for 10 hours... try a different hotel...
__label__2	The food here is good but the service is horrible. Every time I have come it's taken about a half an hour to get a smoothie, which defeats the quick healthy product idea. Usually there's only one person working there and they are constantly checking for what's in my order and clarifying what I ordered 10 minutes after I ordered it. They either need to hire more people or give realistic wait times.
__label__2	All around I found Sabrina's Cafe disappointing.  After we were seated, we were left on our own for over 20 minutes without water or coffee.  My chilaquiles were essentially eggs on top of store-bought tortilla chips with a bit of salsa dribbled on the chips.  Hard to believe that whoever put this together has ever eaten real chilaquiles from Mexico. Won't be back.
__label__2	Below average food quality at above average prices. Friendly service but seriously...charging extra for ANY rice with an entree!
__label__2	So we headed this way to partake in some karaoke.  Amazingly everyone knew how to sing.  The prices on drinks were a little high for such a dive.  Overall, it is an okay stop to make, but you wouldn't want to spend a lot of time there.  Good people watching though.
__label__2	Airport Review at Tampa International. A nice setting and quick and friendly service but the food, at least the Tag Pic Pac was the worst pasta I have had in a long time. The noodles were gummy, sticking to themselves, the tomatoes and garlic simply quick simmered without seasoning. It's quiet frankly a bowl of unloved, uncooked and overcooked ingredient's. Our Meatball and Cheese was nearly as bad, bread balls on foccacia. We ordered more sauce on the side to make it partially edible.
__label__2	Over rated. The service was great but the food was lackluster for the price point. Left a lot to be imagined.
__label__2	I work right around the corner and used to eat here quite frequently. Last night ate here for dinner and was truly disappointed! Everything was off except for the tea. I had the veggie plate and partner had schwarma sandwich. Neither of us was happy. I had a stomach ache to boot later in the evening. Probably will not go back.
__label__2	Party of 6 was told a 40 minute wait for dinner.  50 minutes later, was told that there was at least one other party of 6 before us.  At 65 minutes, staff brought out a platter of pizza for the 30+ people waiting out front, and still one party of 6 before us.  Too little, too late.  Should be more communicative with customers about waiting.  So we said screw this, and went to Cantina instead...Cantina was no wait, bar seating, immediate service, and great food.
__label__2	Rained in our room every morning! Let staff know and it was completely over looked. The safe was broke in our room, was informed by staff we were one of 7 rooms to be fixed. The lock on our door was COMPLETELY missing. Asked front desk to switch rooms, they took my phone number and never got back to me. As for the gym, almost everything is broken and I'm sure high school gyms have more equipment then this place. I can't believe this is a 4 or 5 star hotel! What a joke!
__label__2	Customer service lacks in every area, this is by far the worst location I have been too. I try to avoid this location to be honest the staff usually seems annoyed and in a hurry, I don't know for what I pay per month I just don't feel like I get he quality, time, respect I deserve.
__label__2	Interesting place...lol....This bar was a little seedy for my taste.  The guys on the bar were decent but some were funky.  There were quite a few over 50, overweight bears fondling the dancers.  I felt like I needed a shower afterwards...
__label__2	"I placed my order at the front counter where the iPad lives. The young man who took it asked if I wanted anything to drink. I said I wanted some water. I took a seat on the opposite side of the wall from the grocery section. 

My beef stroganoff was served by a very nice woman. 

I was never served the water I had ordered when I placed my order and tipped. I was also never asked how my food was, even though I had wandered through the grocery section before I left the restaurant.

Meh."
__label__2	I think this is the most overrated restaurant in St. Louis.  I've been about five times and have never been impressed.  The small plates are unimaginative and far from tempting.  The prices are very questionable.  Why not go to Sidney Street?
__label__2	Beto's has great food for the price but the service is terrible and takes forever for my food. Even when I finally get through on the phone and place a to go order they are rude and slow! It is really too bad because it's so close to my work but really tired of the service:(
__label__2	Overpriced burger with a bland taste. Not impressed with the mayo either. I had better at Wendy's.
__label__2	I ordered a Margarita Pizza from the Yelp delivery app (GrubHub). Not a fan. The pizza was cold. The dough was chewy. There was large chunks of salt on the pizza. I didn't like that. The bottom was burnt and it taste burnt. I feel like it could've been good but it just wasn't. At all. Very disappointing.
__label__2	Bland chorizo, you could tell they used cheap slices of cheese for the nachos because you could still see the square
__label__2	We tried Szechuan Castle again about a month ago. The food hasn't improved at all. I'm surprised, as I was hoping the previous experience was a one-time thing.
__label__2	Went to the store expecting to spend my tax return. Arrived at said closing hour exactly on the dot. Was greeted by and unwelcoming staff who neglected to even answer a simple question I had about the business very unprofessional won't be coming here if I can avoid it.
__label__2	Nice place. Good location. Good selection. The bartender/owner (I think it was the owner) is kind of a dick. Would have been 4 stars and actually returned but havent since our first encounter. What a prick.
__label__2	"My trip to targets are usually pleasant, but today when I was in line checking out the cashier was having a full on social hour with another customer. Both the cashier and the customer were holding up the line. About 5-6 people left the line because of the long hold up.

Honestly, after this experience I would now prefer Walmart because at least the cashiers don't do stuff like this. I was in a big rush and this really held me up.  Target, I'm disappointed."
__label__2	What is it with this neighborhood and ethnic food that's different from everywhere else in the world? The palak paneer is awfully GREEN, like they didn't boil it quite long enough or something. And the tikka masala is awfully CREAMY, like too creamy. I dunno. Anyways every time they drop off a menu with a coupon I order some and they drop it off after and hour and the world is well.
__label__2	After reading reviews, gave this place a try on a Sunday morning at 8:30. No line. No other customers. Cases were half empty. Very typical choices - glazed, chocolate glazed, sprinkles. Nothing you haven't seen a hundred times at every other donut shop. Donuts were fine tasting but nothing special. Will keep looking for a donut shop a little more innovative.
__label__2	Stood in line for 10 minutes before they noticed us, then order was wrong, it's usually great here not sure what happened
__label__2	Tried to order breakfast but they were out of half of the options. They had the Mexican menu out and when I tried to order from there but they said they only had breakfast for 50 more minutes. No other to go food options. No healthy food options just friend pop corn chicken. I thought Whole Foods was suppose to have healthier options, I saw none.
__label__2	"This is my last night staying here. Unless I'm forced to stay here I won't be coming back. Toilets don't flush unless you hold the handle. The shower temperature takes a long time to change. No refrigerator in the room, at least not mine. 

A coworker who also stayed here had spiders in his room. Had a cockroach this morning. 

Tried to order room service three times one night. Once I never got an answer. Then the next two times the person answering didn't know what to do. Put me on hold and never came back."
__label__2	"This is my first time here. It could be a lot of fun if the ""DANCE POLICE"" didn't come around making you Sit Down if standing and moving to the music. 
They are a total BUZZ KILL!!!"
__label__2	Deke's use to be my favorite go to for wings, but something is not right about the quality of their poultry lately.  The last two orders were wings with thick, rubbery skin.  I will stick with their brisket from now on.
__label__2	Blah. The noodle soup was a little disappointing. And the featured noodles got a lil gummy. Wonk wonk.
__label__2	Sorry to say but this was one of the most bland pho I ever tasted. I had the pho at 11am on a Tuesday so there should've been enough time to get the broth up to flavor if anything. I will say though that the fried egg roll was delicious. Too bad the pho was a miss for me.
__label__2	Don't bother putting in a mobile order does no good if long drive through line. Still have to wait can't go in.
__label__2	"The food was disappointing all around. 
Gator tail, mozzarella sticks, gyro, boneless wings were subpar. My company didn't enjoy their food either. 

Now for the two stars, the service was phenomenal. Our server said she has been here for for 4 years (blonde girl with glasses). She provided us with really good and fast service. 


Sucks ! The food could of been so much better. Its a real let down."
__label__2	"Meh.
Decent staff helping us or trying to sell us a new phone.

Not gonna buy here, I don't think.

A decent selection of high priced phones."
__label__2	The front desk staff was not friendly.  We arrived at night and the gentleman working barely would even communicate with us. We asked questions and his words were brief and mumbled. Upon entering  the room the odor of mold or such came over us. In the morning theit was much noise do to the construction going on ....with thr renovation it sounded like a refrigerator or tv  would fall through the roof! I called to speak to the front desk she was short and curt and unapologetic. Offer no resolution.
__label__2	"The service was good. I got the Cobb entree salad with grilled chicken. The chicken was cold and dried out. It was most definitely not freshly made.
The floor in the restroom was sticky as was the menu."
__label__2	"OK, this is one of the oddest spots around.  The good news is that there's live music almost every night.  Sometimes it's really good.  The bad news is that it's a horrible venue for live music.   The sound sucks, the lighting is awful, the stage crammed.  Beyond that, the so-called ""service"" is indifferent at best.  Oh how I wish somebody with taste and some money would buy this place who actually respected the musicians."
__label__2	This is the worst Starbucks to ever come to. They are entirely too slow and there's always a long line. They barely ever have anything even early in the morning .. The only reason I gave it two stars is because it's close to my house. I try to avoid coming here and finding a different one on my travels if possible.
__label__2	"I can safely say I'm not the only one that thinks chef Jennifer Zavala is a marginal and uncreative chef, since she got voted off the first episode of Top Chef.  They all agreed that her dish (a chile relleno stuffed with seitan, which was supposed to represent her hot temper) was flat out not good at all, and that it was ""clunky.""  They were even more shocked that she admitted to using seitan all the time.  Maybe now that she left El Camino they will get someone who actually cooks meat and cooks it well."
__label__2	Servers are great. Food is not that good. Chicken and dumplings were disappointing. Chicken was dry. Corn bread and biscuit are a bit dense for my taste. Mac and cheese is made with real cheese. Sweet tea is perfect. There was a long line at the cashiers. Not sure if thats normal. But I went on a Tuesday night. Prices are great. A hearty meal for less than $10.
__label__2	"Wendy's is Wendy's. The only reason I am even reviewing this one is because of the spicy chicken sandwich (#6!). It is comfort food after a terrible & late night at work (hours are good here as well).

Staff is pretty much what you expect from a fast food place and I've had more than my share of weird experiences ordering from the drive thru - which is odd, because usually fast food is pretty much standardized."
__label__2	Overall Beef o Bradys makes good food. I only dined in once, and it was good service. Most of the times I just take out. The curly fries are amazing. The burgers can be a little sloppy/greasy but the quality is very good.
__label__2	Waiter was a little loony, 1/2 turkey&cheese sandwich was dry, TVs were fuzzy. Nice atmosphere overall.
__label__2	The service was outstanding, and the food was good, but nothing any different than Chevy's or the like. The guitarist was good.
__label__2	Pizza was just OK. A lil too doughy ( too much bread) for me. Sauce on pizza had a really good flavor and slices were generous also. Good hang over food.
__label__2	"Not a whole lot of direction when we entered - had to ask a lot of questions to get an answer on where we could sit. 

Whipped feta as an app was delish. Figs in bacon were nothing special and fairly small for the price. 

Pork Belly Gnocchi was under-seasoned and didn't have any pork belly flavor

The trout entree was good, but not the correct fish to serve whole (because of all the bones). It made eating a chore and wasn't appetizer. 

Staff was friendly. 

Undecided if we'll return."
__label__2	I just want to say that the staff is super sweet and super friendly. With that being said the food is terrible. Everything is greasy and cheap. They use fake eggs, fake butter, and my eggs and potatoes and old burnt pieces of food that was previously made on the grill. The bacon had a sweet flavor too it and looked like it had been sitting around for at least a day.
__label__2	I love Dunkin' Donuts. I'm a Dunkin' Donuts diehard. But man, this one location really bums me out. Every time I go to this location, the workers seem very annoyed to be taking my order even though there's never any line and not helpful. Today I just had to laugh because my experience was so bad. Dunkin' please help out this location!
__label__2	The software has good and bad. The best feature is the accounting. The accounting is intuitive from a property accounting and work flow perspective.  The worst feature is the maintenance and work order process. This is not intuitive. It is cumbersome and tedious. It takes too may steps and could be easily streamlined for a way better effective and efficient ease of use.
__label__2	Work was good. One vehicle stolen from there and one vehicle broken into. The first time it happened they were great. The second time it happened they were not great.
__label__2	"I love Niche and all of Gerard Craft's restaurants. The food always amazes me and the service is outstanding.  So why am I giving Niche only 2 stars? The noise level in the new space ruins the entire experience. I was at a work function with clients and no one at the table could here anyone else.  The food was still outstanding, but really one can't enjoy it due to the noise level.

Mr. Craft, please do something with the noise!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
__label__2	So after arriving in NOLA we hightailed it to Cafe Bamboo for a yummy dinner - or so we thought.  PULEEZ...the reviewers MUST be desperate for veggie/vegan fare around here.  I am from Austin and have been a vegan for 30 years - this IS NOT delicious vegan food.  It is overpriced, small portions, and mediocre.  What a disappointment.  The place was also just a bit too grunge for me - what a let down.  Now San Francisco - there is the city for delicious vegan food.
__label__2	Pretty average sausage po-boy with a dry as a bone roll. It would have been better if the bread hadn't seemed like it sat out all day under a heat lamp. The shrimp po-boy was loaded down with shrimp and the roll seemed more edible than the one for the sausage, but not great by any means. Great lavazzo coffee, though.
__label__2	Overpriced toys and clothes. Very expesive for independent owned store, but I guess we pay that price for having it in a good location?? Staff were decently nice and offered thier help but overall IT IS VERY EXPENSIVE.
__label__2	"Amazing cocktails, but the whole place smelled like dirty sponge and the bartender was the biggest dick ever. 

Pretentious, snarling and insufferable.   No amount of mixology can erase the stain of rude service."
__label__2	Dropped by on Thanksgiving afternoon for drinks expecting at least a few beautiful fall-like floral arrangements only to see a couple old beat up pumpkins at the front door Barkeeper acted as if they were doing us a favor with drinks. After going on deck only to find dried bird crap on the tables and chairs. Wow, huge disappointment, won't be returning, thx!
__label__2	I love the overall hustle and bustle of the restaurant, but carts are slow and unless you're sitting near the kitchen, the selection of food that makes it's way to the other side of the restaurant is meh.
__label__2	Wawa was good till they started slacking. Can't even make a sandwich right anymore. Booooooooooooooo
__label__2	This place is a dump.  Old, used and abused.  Stay somewhere else.  Weird layout, old games, dirty.
__label__2	We ordered from this restaurant because we both love Chinese food. After a long days work we were looking forward to our meal. However we were very disappointed. The food was tasteless. It's almost like they forgot to season the food. Then the sauces were bitter instead of sweet. I wish I could find something positive to say. Considering how expensive our food was, we won't be ordering from there again.
__label__2	"So excited to try a ""new"" pizza joint in the area. Unfort, won't probably be returning. 

The pepperoni pizza was SOAKING, DRIPPING with with grease. The garlic cheese bread was bland and unimpressive. The arancini was soggy and tasteless. 

The place is very clean. The staff is polite, but sadly.... not impressed with the food."
__label__2	There are much better choices than this restaurant. Fish and chips should be a signature dish in an Irish Pub themed restaurant, here they were poorly executed. A cold beer was the only bright spot.
__label__2	"This review is only about their gluten free pizza...if you are a celiac or have a real allergy you should definitely skip out. Sadly. 

It tastes great -  but I've had muscle/bone pain for days since eating it. It's not a surprise that there is kitchen contamination as they don't promise a GF kitchen -- but sometimes pizza places understand how to really do it right.

This isn't one of them. Wouldn't want anyone else to make the same mistake I did."
__label__2	"Where do I start?

I ordered 3 tacos (spicy chicken, fish and shrimp) and they lacked flavor and seasoning. The salsa they had on hand helped, but nothing could rescue the dry and bland/flavorless food that I received.  It was lunch, it was busy but yet my food was almost cold. How the heck does that happen?

This place is meant for folks who don't like food with flavor and for those that hate themselves.  Otherwise avoid if possible."
__label__2	Service is ridiculous.  Amazes me how popular this place is as food ok and service from bat to tables is terrible
__label__2	Huge disconnect between the Internet advertising and ordering and the local franchise... Takes a least 20 to 25 minutes to get the order right online... as far as I can tell you usually get a better deal online then you do at the local pizza place ...Food Quality has gone down hill. I'm going to pass for now mainly because of the lack of response from their corporate office
__label__2	We always wanted to try this Chinese restaurant. The only good things I have to say about the meal we had tonite was it was hot and the chicken fried rice was good. Cashew chicken was terrible very dry and no flavor. My wife said her sweet and sour chicken was the worst she had ever had dry and not a good flavor. Crab rangoons were dry. Egg drop soup no words it was nasty! Sorry will not be ordering there again.
__label__2	"Love the doctor - but the office management is awful? The wait times are disrespectful to patients - most of us have jobs and limited time . 
There is no acknowledgment by office staff of the long waits and routine 30-45 mins late appointments"
__label__2	The food is extremely mediocre.  It looks edible, yet it's still highly bland.  It went from hot to cold within 2 minutes, which means it's actually all microwaved.  Unfortunately I couldn't say I enjoyed it at all.
__label__2	We have been coming here for a good part of 10 years. The past two times we have gone were pretty bad. The quality has really been slipping. The pizza has been very underdone once and then very overdone the next time. For the prices that are charged, I would expect a much better pizza. If you are paying $40 for a pizza, it needs to be done well. It seems like the staff has changed or management has changed and then the quality went down.
__label__2	"Take a good look at the grass when u first time you drive in, because that's the last time you'll see any. Greens are decent, but tee boxes are HORRIBLE. Driving range is only thing worth going for, and even those
Aren't great. I hate saying bad things about the staff because the majority are great, but the Fat bald guy that works there's an Asshole, and makes me not want to support that shit hole. Rest of the staff is friendly and nice...but If fattys workin there turn around and go to Cobbs."
__label__2	Ordered medium on a burger and a steak, but  received  bloody rare on both.  Decided to go hungry and heat them up later.  So disappointed.
__label__2	The restaurant brewed beer was great - I recommend the amber bock.  Wish I could say the same about the food and service.  Food was mediocre.  A few of my companions got burgers and said that they were bland - nothing special.  Got the bread pudding for dessert and would not recommend it!  It had no flavor!  Server acted like the group was putting her out.  There are many better places in New Orleans and I would save your dinner money for somewhere better!
__label__2	We tried this restaurant for the first time and none of us were impressed.  We all said we'd take this one off of our list of restaurants to patronize.  The food was bland, the middle of my lasagna was cold, and the bread was not a good Italian restaurant bread at all.  For the price we will take a pass.
__label__2	It's OK. New York style pizza which, admittedly, is not my first choice. But it's a nice addition to the Bywater and so glad to see it's doing well. But pizza, like burgers, is not this city's forte.
__label__2	I'm surprise the Intelligencer is still in business in the internal age.  The size of the paper has dwindled significantly.  The lost my business for good when I went to cancel and the constantly called me.  Tip:  Play along and give them your updated phone # to contact you at.  The only way I was able to get them to stop.
__label__2	"After we arrived we were told that we could not place our orders for food for another 45 minutes due to kitchen staff shortage. Really? Isn't that their job to have enough staff? 
The place was so loud that we could not converse without yelling.
We have been here before. Decent food. Nothing special.
If you go - sit outside."
__label__2	"The staff members are normally overworked, so you'll have to forgive them if they appear to be a bit brusque or if they don't go in for the ritual exchange of pleasantries that you might expect.  Anyway, they do their best.  Despite this, there are problems.

For instance, the fries that I've been served are overcooked and/or cold every single time I've eaten at this particular location.  That isn't ideal for a McD's.  Meh."
__label__2	Disappointed.  Eggs for omelet were inadequately scrambled, omelet was flat and undercooked with minimal ingredients.  Coffee was pedestrian.  The service was prompt and pleasant.  Overall, price for value was bad.  Would not return.  I was debating between here and Hobb's.  But I was swayed by 4.7 on Yelp.  That number is way too high.
__label__2	Not what i expected from service. Interesting management team. Great server, can't say the same About their hierarchy.
__label__2	I honestly dont know what happened to this place. It used to be my favorite place to eat in town but it has seriously gone downhill. It was dirty inside and full of flies. Our server was nice but not very attentive. The food was cold and tasteless. It looked like a microwave dinner. The ice cream is still good but everything else was just bad. The only good food I had was a bite of the chicken quesadilla, which was full of flavor.
__label__2	wow coming from san francisco.. this dim sum is really not up to par... size of the har gaw was really small and little... it had little to no shrimps in them.... and the rice wrap was soggy.. really gross. Yes there is a lot of variety of dim sum here but everything looked really unappetizing to me as the carts were going around.... Unsure about the other food here... but I wont come back here for dim sum..
__label__2	I walked past here the other day after hours and thought the shop looked so cute that I had to come back and try it out! Very tiny shop but beautifully decorated. I love that they keep the cupcakes displayed in a glass cabinet. They were all so beautiful looking that it was hard to choose. I went with the banana rama. I would say they were average in size, but was shocked to find out they cost $4 a piece. Not worth the money!
__label__2	Went for haircut and highlights.  Liked the highlights, hated the haircut.  The stylist (different from the person who did my highlights) didn't even bother to ask me what kind of haircut I wanted.  They just did a quick trim and didn't listen to how I was repeatedly asking them to cut my hair.  Not happy and Not worth the money.  Won't be going back..
__label__2	"Burgers are sub par to average at best.. Looks like Florida is just use to this level of average. Nothing special about the place.  Manager was nice, but it's about the food isn't it? Food is average that's it. Better off making your own on a grill.  Oh, but they do have a seating area ON THE PARKING LOT! 
Ugh"
__label__2	"It's a hole in the wall.   Emphasis on the hole.

Beer was on the pricey side, music was absolutely dreadful.  They did have some interesting brews on tap, which is their one saving grace."
__label__2	Sorry for the two star rating. I'm sure your food is good here, but we wouldn't know. We randomly found this place while driving through Carpinteria. It looked inviting, saw a few families eating there so we decided to stop. As we walked up a busboy flipped over the open sign to close. It was 8:28pm. Really? Having worked in food service myself I know how frustrating it is to have a couple of people walk in at the last moment. Suggest you change your hours to 930 considering you're a restaurant off a main thorough way.
__label__2	Friendly server. Food was honestly terrible- not sure how this place gets any good reviews for the food. It was all cheddar-jack on a tortilla. Definitely not Mexican food- pretty darn nasty, actually.
__label__2	"$19 for steak fajitas that included 6 small pieces of steak, and then tons of onions and peppers. No rice or black beans, although there were some other tiny sides. There was nothing special about the fajitas, I could have been at any cheap Mexican restaurant and would have expected about the same.

Verdict: very poor value, and nothing special."
__label__2	Bought a chair last November, less than a year old. More expensive model with fabric protection. The chair squeaks like crazy. Called them and they want me to pay 79 bucks to have someone come out and look at it. Pay attention to the warranty in writing and NOT what the salesman tells you!! Not worth the money.
__label__2	"Ordered from here a few times. Delivery is always excellent but the food is just so so. What really irks me is that they use drumettes (the very small chicken wings) rather than normal wings and charge a true premium. 

12 bucks for a dozen baby sized wings is absurd. I worked long enough in kitchens to know that scam and I'm sure there's gonna be a comment about how they shrink when you cook them but that simply isn't accurate. 

Everything else I've ordered has been just ok."
__label__2	Got the green mint and it was pretty much food coloring and syrup. Was not expecting it to be so sweet. Probably should have just gotten a milk tea instead.
__label__2	Really disappointing experience, burgers were super greasy and messy. The pop music they were playing was way too loud. For 2 burgers, 1 order of fries and 2 milkshakes, the check was well over $40 after tip. Not worth it!
__label__2	Was a little bit disappointed with my Percy Street experience! I went with my dad a few weeks back and was really looking forward to it! We waited almost an hour to be served, and nearly 20 minutes just to get our drinks! I think the manager could see that we were frustrated, so he came and apologized, which I really appreciated. But the food was underwhelming. I'm bummed, but glad I gave it a try! The environment is very cool.
__label__2	If I were to have written this review 2 years again it should sounds a lot different.  Unfortunately, the quality of the food has sank, and the prices are enough to make you go belly up.  What used to taste like fresh, well-crafted sushi, now tastes like mushy, previously frozen bait hidden by sauces, soy, and wasabi.  I know I should not be too picky about sushi in a land-locked city, but if this is my only option, I think I will just keep swimming.
__label__2	Came here twice...one time dinner...had the most saltiest fries and wings Ever! It was nasty. Second time I stopped by for lunch and it was just okay...gonna have to take a lot of convincing to get me back in...
__label__2	Kinda expensive for rather dry crunchy cookie. I dont mind the crunch if it's thin and badass but it was pretty thick and didnt have much flavor. Happy I tried but won't be returning.
__label__2	Bad value. $10 for a turkey sandwich with lettuce. If you order a sandwich, expect to pay extra for basics like tomato and onion. Or better yet, skip this place altogether!
__label__2	Honestly, the food here was pretty bad. I had the calamari, and it was more breading than seafood, and had pretty much no flavor- I think there was absolutely no salt. After that, it took forever until our main course came out even though there really weren't many other tables. I had the salmon and spicy mashed potatoes- the menu never said the mashed potatoes would be sweet potatoes, and the seasoning was really weird. The maple on the salmon was wayyyyy too sweet.
__label__2	Rude staff, pretentious bouncers with black clothing, velvet rope = nonsense.  This place is actually pretty shabby (for a mansion), the layout is weird, and the drinks are weak and overpriced.  The music is really bad, and the place just reeks of everything I used to hate about Rittenhouse nightclubs.
__label__2	"The prices are outrageous!!!! It's so hard for me to even pick up a few things out of convenience here. It's so close to my apartment but I can't stand paying way more than things are worth. 

I give the staff mixed reviews. I've had a few people be very helpful in finding things...but there are some grumpy cashiers that really take away from the experience.

I go here only as an absolute last resort."
__label__2	I've dined here about 4 times, and only once have I had a good meal.  Service is good and the ambiance of the place is nice, but the food is just lacking.  I have had one of my worst meals ever at this place, a spice cajun chicken fettucini that was just a sticky blob of lukewarm pasta and dry chicken.  I stopped going about a year ago.  Maybe it has gotten better since then.
__label__2	Great location. Nice atmosphere.   Those are the best things I can say. The overworked waitress was also the bartender. Red beans and rice was okay. Burger was overcooked because they forgot to put cheese on it and threw it back on the grill. Fries were great but How do you cook the flavor out of bacon?
__label__2	"It pains me to leave such a poor review. But seriously who is running this Dunkin Donuts?  I'm from the North East and never would the stuff that happens here happen at any other Dunkin. Which makes me sad bc it is a really poor representation of a terrific brand.  

Someone really needs to wake up. The coffee is not fresh. They are out of ice coffee on plenty of occasions.  And the donut racks where a complete mess. No one is trying here. It's sad."
__label__2	My biggest disappointment is that Chick-Fil-A left the food court.  It was the only one anywhere near where we live.  A lot of stores have closed up and left.
__label__2	"All I can say is where has all of the good people gone? There use to be friendly people who would get enjoyment out of pleasing others with their charm but not anymore, now there's rude people anymore who also don't want to work. NOT everyone I will ""emphasize"" but this place is dirty, foods $$, and just needs to make changes and then I believe they would have full lines again and won't be short on staff."
__label__2	This place tries... but fails. I've been a MB local for years and if I'm craving a Big Mac I pass this place and go to the McD's on Seminole Blvd. Much hotter and fresher. Of the dozens of times I've been here I've had maybe one or two positive experiences. Ice cream machine has been broken way more than any other location, plus they're just slow. The location and eating area is nice, only reason I'll give it 2 stars.
__label__2	"The staff was friendly enough, and it's the only convenient beer store in downtown Malvern, but... 


-Very high prices (a mix case of Shock Top, a 12 pack of Sierra Nevada Pale cans, and a 12 pack Saranac mix cans came to over $70; this shouldn't be more than $50)
-Only a mediocre selection
-Moldy and foul smelling cooler

Pass Harlan Beverage up if you've got time to go a mile away."
__label__2	I felt like my lashes fell off very fast. I had some fall off the day I got them done. Now not even two weeks later one of my eyes is almost bare and the other is lopsided.
__label__2	Neon lights of blue and pink, the same color of the chicken we ordered. The plated food clicked our tables faster than the selfies of the tweens that lined the storefront. Many restaurants are going with an aesthetic gimmick to bring tribes of young people to their lack luster restaurant, but I thought an establishment in downtown Philly would muster more substance and grit.
__label__2	What a dump. Mop bucket and wet vac left in customer area. No hand soap, dryer or paper towels in what I guess you'd call the restroom. At least the soap vending machine accepted Apple/Google Pay, and the machines themselves worked.
__label__2	"Party of 5. Very small table and uncomfortable chairs. 3 of us ordered tri tip sandwiches and no one finished them. Served on a hoagie stiff bun that made it hard to enjoy the tri tip. Meatloaf and mashed potatoes epic fail. Potatoes soupy and meatloaf tasted
Like frozen dinner. The salad was the worst soggy and tasteless. Best part of meal was the garlic bread. Will not return"
__label__2	Quality is definitely declining at this joint! I really hate the paper bowls they give you now....the liquids leak through the bottom. Who's lame brain idea was this?
__label__2	Average food slow service not too friendly. I ordered chicken chow mein asked for celery they said they have none asked for bean sprouts they said they had none what Chinese restaurant have you ever been to that has no celery or bean sprouts?No inside dining I suggest another restaurant.
__label__2	"Too loud .
It was like trying to eat inside a large echo chamber. 

I tried to eat outside but the wait to eat outside was longer than inside .

I had a headache so I can't give a honest review of the food.
 I would return if they sound proof this place !"
__label__2	I was really disappointed in this place. Pros are an excellent rooftop bar and hip vibe. My gnocchi with smoked chicken was also really delicious. Presentation was beautiful. However, my old fashioned cocktail was okay, and my other food (ceasar salad and gelato dessert) was really subpar. I feel like for the price, I should walk away thinking everything was delicious, but unfortunately, I just didn't.
__label__2	I long considered this as the best pizza in Tampa bay. Not anymore. They've gone downhill to a point that I can't eat this pizza anymore. The eggplant and ricotta pizza was the best around. Now it taste bad and sends you to the toliette.
__label__2	Used to be great. Been here a few times since new ownership and service has gone way down. Don't accommodate for substitutions anymore and not as friendly as they used to be. Hate to see places no longer value top level customer service
__label__2	Slow slow service. I attribute to not enough oyster shuckers at happy hours, which are 4 to 8. The oysters are not clean, with endless grit. The food is ok otherwise, but with so many choices, why settle. I'll hunt out other ouster options next time. Red Fish Grill maybe.
__label__2	I cook for a living so I know a little about restaurants, and I know that it doesn't take an hour to deliver a 12 inch pizza...
__label__2	This use to be go to. Pretty disappointed tonight. Maybe they had a off night . Service was horrible, shrimp was small with little taste . I had the chargrilled oysters, usually money .. they were still a raw with very little garlic , butter , no crackers , no bread . Disappointing guys .
__label__2	"'Ribs' is in their name - but don't be fooled. Just go to Jack's across the street. These ribs were dry. They were bland. They weren't very meaty. And the overly sweet sauce tasted like something off the shelf from Kroger. Ditto for the side dishes.
On this Monday night, the cover bands were OK.  The service was OK. The whole place was generally disheveled.
I won't be back."
__label__2	"Two stars and why do they get that? Because aside from their cute clothes and jewelry their exchanging damaged item policy is a JOKE!

They want you to provide original receipt and tags with anything o exchange it even if it is damaged.  I will not go back based on their return policies alone."
__label__2	Order take out orange chicken tasted more like a bad sweet and sour chicken. Literally no orange in the dish. Garlic chicken was off as well, overall food looked okay but had little to no flavor.
__label__2	Some friends and I were passing through Nashville on a Road trip and found the Urban Cookhouse on Yelp. Great menu selection and reasonable prices. I ordered online through Yelp BUT unfortunately our order was never processed and we had to order and wait on our food upon arrival. Fun environment and a good outdoor patio area. I ordered the Cookhouse wrap. Great food!
__label__2	"Fish tacos stink- 2 tacos, no toppings, soggy fries.

grilled cheese comes on rye- all crust.

Chicken sandwich- thinnest meat in existence, all bun, don't bother 

Its dark as hell in here. They caught me on a nice day which is why they're getting 2 stars instead of 1."
__label__2	Long waits on hold for phone. Depending on the day the staff is okay. If it's busy and they have a call out it's a rough one. Clearly pharmacy is understaffed. There are a few I can accurately describe but that wouldn't be fair to them. body language is a dead give away. Either cvs doesn't pay well or these people are truly mad at the way their lives are sometimes.  Specifically the pharmacy. God forbid the phone rings....  you literally watch them look at eachh other to see who will answer it when standing in line
__label__2	This place just sucks. Let's see, one time the waitress spilled soda on one of the people in our group. Just a sorry. Every time service took forever. Pricing is just too high for the quality of food you get. Only been back a couple times just to have a beer with the guys. So, 1 star for getting a beer order right,and 1 star because they might have a hot rod in work.
__label__2	I had the pancakes and they were not the best. They were hard to cut and were not the most eye appealing. The bottoms was holey. Like it had a bunch of holes at the bottom that made me not want to eat it. And our server was also not quite polite as well. The last thing is that it smelled like a hotbox in there.
__label__2	The food is great, but we waited over 40 minutes just to get a to-go order. Will not be ordering from here again anytime soon.
__label__2	"I came here for a gel pedi. The pedi from start to finish was terrible. My nails were shaped oddly, the tech didn't bother trimming my cuticles and the ""massage"" was more of a hand sliding up and down my leg several times as she stared out into the parking lot and the polish was sloppy. I recommend this place only if you see Ken. He is a perfectionist and amazing at what he does. All the other techs I've tried have been disappointing."
__label__2	"Fast service but one dinner forgotten. Spring rolls cold. Egg drop soup very greasy flavor. 
Not worth price ordered. 
We did delivery through HubStub. First time using this app and eatery. Not impressed at all !!
Not cheap either."
__label__2	If you have tables that are visible empty how can you tell patrons it will be a 1-1.5 hour wait.  Let's be honest it's raw fish...not a lot of cooking required. The hostess attitude was a bit pompous also. In a dying segment of st.louis known as Westport make a reservation before trying to get a table for two at 8pm on a Sunday.
__label__2	Difficult to get a call back. Elsa couldn't get it together. Someone did come to look at what I needed but Elsa said they don't do quotes? I decided to go someone else.
__label__2	"If you are looking for any kind of assistance or help regarding a retail purchase, forget it. The front desk staff are extremely rude, unhelpful and have that ""holier than thou"" pretentious air about them. Every time I go in there, I leave with an awful taste in my mouth and no product to boot. 
I've had my piercings done here, they do great work and I've never had any issues with healing or placement or anything like that, but they certainly could use a better support team. PLEASE HIRE NICER PEOPLE! THANKS!"
__label__2	Hmmm. Where to begin? My neighborhood Shop 'n Save. Just know going in you will see individuals cut past you and the cashier in line without paying. The line you have been waiting in for 20 minutes.
__label__2	Went here for the second time, ever.  Tried the catfish this time.  Barely had any meat on the filets. Mostly just breading. Do not get the catfish!
__label__2	"My Mother-in-law stay there a couple of weeks ago, the staff was great, room was ok til we saw ants in the sink and around the baseboard of the wall..Told the maid but I do not think she told anybody..

We will have to rethink her next visit where she is going to stay."
__label__2	I ordered the chicken schwarma plate, the food was hot but the hummus was a little tangy, i have been to other places and tested hummus but was not ever familiar with it tasting tangy. Over all the food was OK. One thing that was really a disappointment was that the nan that they served was NOT home made, so lacked character. I also ordered the Lebanese tea and was good, tasted like Lipton instant tea with rosewater.
__label__2	Not worth the wait at all, very underwhelming and bland. The beignets are the only good thing on the menu. The fried chicken and waffles were terrible! Poorly seasoned and unappetizing. If you want a good breakfast, Jeanine's is far better!
__label__2	Not a top Popeye's location. My several visits over the past four years revealed sluggish and often incorrect service, frequent substitutions, and difficult to get in and out of due to poor placement. I generally avoid them  unless I really want Popeyes.
__label__2	Not clean. I went in this afternoon to get take out and it was dark, every surface was dirty including the rug, tables, the bathroom. It made me nervous to eat the food. Downtown location seems a little cleaner but don't think I'll try this place ever again.
__label__2	This was my first Sushi experience in Tucson, as a transplant from CT, It was recommended to me by the locals so I figured I would give it a try. I went during lunch and was less than impressed. all the sushi tasted the same, their rolls seemed to be non standard with odd ingredients and I don't think I would come back again, Maybe I was to hopeful for good sushi in the desert, maybe you can only get good sushi on the coast, but I will keep looking for something better.
__label__2	With such a large variety of good sounding choices, I've expected Marathon to be better.  But everytime I've gone, the food is less than flavorful.  Fries lack flavor, the seared tuna salad had very little tuna.
__label__2	Ordered chicken & waffles, got waffles and 1.5 chicken tenders. Music was oppressive loud despite four people being in the establishment. Coincidence?
__label__2	"Smallish LaFitness with equipment in various states of disrepair. Locker rooms are small and FILTHY. There are only 4 showers in the womens locker room and they are moldy, covered in hair (it even clings to the walls)  and they are tiny (about the size of a cruise ship shower).

Were this not super close to my work and Norristown Farm Park (so I can take a shower after my evening runs), I'd stay away. Yes, it's that filthy"
__label__2	"I've only had the pizza. A few times sadly (because it was the only option)...

and my god.

I dont know what ingredients they use, but it's all wrong. The cheese falls right off. It's loose, watery, and not very flavorful. The bread/crush taste amateur. 

I dont know who is in charge of the Pizza there, but it seriously is lacking. If they just improved their Pizza recipe , I'm sure the place would thrive."
__label__2	Service is good but the food is NOT ! The pasta was over cooked, the sauces ( marinara & Alfredo ) were out of a can and the calamari was very chewy ( previously frozen ). Definitely nothing is fresh or homemade:(
__label__2	In terms of a Cracker Barrel experience, this was the worst I've ever had. We were given food without silverware. They literally brought out the top of a tomato. Then it took forever to get ahold of someone to get more syrup. When I went to pay I was made fun of because my card wasn't working immediately. Crackle Barrel is one of my favorite places to eat, but I will never return to this location.
__label__2	Food was flavorful but I won't return. Midway through my meal I found a hair on my roll, and there was something near the bottom of my water glass (like on the wall of the glass) that I did not initially notice.
__label__2	"I was really craving hibachi so we attempted a Saturday night dinner. I hate giving restaurants bad reviews but they just missed the mark on nearly everything. 

Service was abominably slow. I wasn't sure if the restaurant was understaffed but other waiters had no apparent trouble, while ours took nearly 40 minutes from being seated to get us drinks. 

The hibachi chefs dropped nearly everything they tossed in the air. 

The food was nothing special, everything tasted the same. 

I won't be going back."
__label__2	Largest seafood selection.  Everything else is fairly expensive.  The meat section is not attractive in quality and price.  Most of the dried noodles has no expiration dates.  Beware.  Large selection of veggies, and descend prices.  Look for promotional sale for sauces in display.  Good deal.  Zero customer service.  The cashier is all you got if you need any help.
__label__2	This place has really let it's quality slide. One person had a Frisco melt, and the grease was dripping from the already drenched bread, and they could only eat a couple bites in fear of regurgitating the next bite. I had a chili dog with fries. The hot dog was so rubbery it was difficult to chew it, and it barely had any chili or cheese on it. The only plus was that half of the fries were edible- 2 stars
__label__2	The service here is awful! I appreciate the store and what they have to offer as far as products as well as pricing, but sometimes the service literally makes me question whether or not it's worth it. The guys working there have gotten my measurements wrong at least twice, and when I go to retrieve the fitted clothes, they act like its my fault!
__label__2	Was So excited to try this place so for our 5th anniversary I made a reservation and off we went.. Where did it all go wrong well that would have been the moment we got seated and waited and waited and yes you guessed it waited some more for the server. The service was horribly slow from beginning to the end. The food Bland form the appetizers (sliders) to the entrees..The Portion size was the only plus but that dose nothing if the food is not that good.
__label__2	It's your standard buffet but I do like the hibachi grill options, such as prawns, tuna, and steak, all seared to your liking.  Everything else is the typical fare.  The staff are pretty friendly.  I haven't eaten here but do grab a takeout box every so often ($3.99/lb for lunch).
__label__2	Typically This place is a real shot in the arm! Today after the visit with the doctor I was sent to the lab section for a blood draw. After waiting 30 minutes I approached the desk to question why and was told I was next, 20 minutes later I was informed I was not in the system and they could not help me. Return to Dr who says I am in the system. I end up leaving and may or may not return on Saturday to get test done.
__label__2	Greek salad with Chicken was ok, but the portion and quality of protein were poor and salad size were very small for $9.00.. wouldn't go back as chicken was chopped up lunchmeat..
__label__2	Decided to eat inside....15 minutes later we finally have our food. Tacos r less than tasty and sorta stale. Fries r cold but chicken was *fresh* i guess. Usually i go thru drive thru but i wasnt alone today and she wanted to go inside.
__label__2	First we ordered 4 appetizers, first one came which was delicious then we waited 20 minutes for the others. For entree we order whole fish, salad which came with fish was superb, but sea bass was fried to long and dried. When it comes to service, nobody was cleaning our table. At the end we enjoyed the cocktails.
__label__2	When we got there it was a wait. No big deal. Even though we waited 30 min that doesn't bother me, what bothers me is that I asked how much longer the wait was going to be as I seen several groups get seated before us who showed up after... turned out they had crossed out our group off the waiting list so we were waiting for nothing. Only reason I gave it 2 stars was because the food was decent and we didn't wait long after being seated to get our food
__label__2	Went expecting delicious cookies...showed up to find what resembled Subway cookies. Didn't end up buying anything.
__label__2	I ate lunch here with a friend after the MS walk.  Our handsome host basically walked us to our table and I literally past him on the way to my table.  So, in other words he didn't seat us he merely put our menus on the table and walked away.  I was put off by this.  Our waitress was great.  Our meal was meh...I have had five occasions where the meal has been meh.  The host sealed the deal on my ever returning..
__label__2	"Cracker Barrel has large portions, not appetizing, the drinks were meh, with a cute old country store.  If you don't have an established pallet, you'll love this place.  

The paper menus were soiled (YUCK!)."
__label__2	Went near open and stood at the register for awhile without anyone coming over. The bartender was there and just doing side work and made eye contact but didn't say anything. 2 stars because the menu looked good!
__label__2	"I reeeeeaaallly wanted to love this place!! My mom loved it here , God rest her soul
 5 stars for ambiance and jazz music!! Staff is friendly too! Food was meh. that's what the 2 stars are for from me. $30 for the buffet!?!!? WAY overpriced! Who can eat $30 of food anyway? Lol. Of course you are paying just to be here ."
__label__2	"Seated quickly and given water.
Server was quick to take our drink order.  Second round of drinks took 15 minutes to appear. 
Food is interesting but way way  too overly salted.- all meals. Mentioned this to our server and he just chuckled.
Korean chicken sandwich over cooked- almost black. 
Burger decent but small and priced high at $15 considering you are eating on a picnic table.
Won't return"
__label__2	ALERT: new owners!  This is no longer our cherished La Pasadita.  Don't bother, its really not very good.
__label__2	"It had rained, mind the word HAD, and I went to eat solo and enjoy the patio with my pup and they refused to seat me because the seat was wet. I asked if I could wipe it down. She went and asked and came back with a NO. 
I paid for a cab to get there so I'm highly irritated that I spent money just to get there and then was never served. 
Why a two rating ? From what I saw atmosphere kicked ass."
__label__2	I was looking at all the 5 star reviews and thought I had found a great place.  I was disappointed in some of the items.  I got the grilled salmon, it was tasty.  I would say average, nothing special.  Green beans tasted like they were out of the can with maybe some onion...not good.  Greens were fair, Mississippi Belle's are MUCH better.  Mac and cheese was pretty good.  Definitely homemade.  Key lime pie was just ok, crust tasted old.  Serving sizes are small.  I would not go back.
__label__2	Huge slices that are vibrant with a very thin crust. They weren't heated up very well and felt a too soggy and floppy for me. Two slices filled me up nicely, though. BBQ Chicken was too sweet, however. I want to explore menu more. Cash only. Across the street from my pediatrician, so I'll visit again most likely.
__label__2	I saw poop all over the walls and I heard a Rat noise in the bathroom.You McChicken tastes dry and crusty.
__label__2	Visited again and food was good but service was non exhistant. Waited over an hour to be served after orders were placed. Tables all around us received their food but we just sat. No apologies, we were just ignored like we were not there. So we walked. Probably weren't even missed. Probably forgot to hand in order. Did not see waitress again. Maybe shift was over. Good by.
__label__2	I have always like Crushed Red but the last few times the salads are just sub par. To much lettuce stalk and not enough lettuce. Salad was kinda watery and the Caesar dressing needs an upgrade. They also need a way for you to get everything to your table with out making two or three trips from the counter. If you get a soup, salad and a drink you can't carry that all at once.
__label__2	I still need to find a great Chinese restaurant in Santa Barbara. The food was not terrible but it was just ok. It's a little bit more on the sweet side for me and a little too oily.
__label__2	"Mediocre pizza priced fairly high ($14 for a 16"" one topping) and several large slices only had 1 or 2 pieces of pepperoni. 

A few weeks ago, we had to wait 45 minutes after a pizza was supposed to be ready. On this spring break weekend night, apparently the manager was so cheap he only allowed one oven to be turned on.

The only reason we've gone there again is because my wife likes their  (pricey) GF dough."
__label__2	"It was OK but not what I expected.  Excellent service and the place was clean.  But Philly Magazine rating it as ""Best"" was not deserved."
__label__2	Visited last weekend.   Very unimpressed.   Wanted to order food but the server never came back!  Flat beer and lousy service.   I'll pass next time and try the brewpub nearby.
__label__2	"Theres really nothing nice about this theater.  First, its in a sketchy area and the shood step up security like the Sanger did. Instead, their own staff seems questionable.  The door man chatting it up with his buddies smoking a cigarette.  The stage is small and the theater doesnt have any charm.

Overall, unless its something you really want to see, I'd pass on going here."
__label__2	"The whole ""bottomless"" fries concept turned into an ironic joke when I received 10 steak fries on my original plate and the waiter disappeared until I had finished my burger. After flagging our waiter down we asked for a couple more orders of fries for our table (and refills on drinks). We received one order of fries after everyone at our table was already done eating. Despite their heavily marketed bottomless fries, we ate less fries here than we would have at a different restaurant, all due to cost cutting in the kitchen and poor service."
__label__2	Wait time is too long. They only care about counter sales. We waited 20 minutes for order our food but nobody came to our table. It seems like their priority is regular customers. If you are outsider , good luck getting the service.
__label__2	Not a good place for good. Disappointed with the quality of food. Oil was floating in the chicken nachos. Wings were not spicy at all. I ordered for a bottle of wine and she bought it open. The only good part was the dessert. It was overloaded with chocolate and topped with vanilla ice cream.
__label__2	This place's service has really declined. I raved about this place when I first ate here, but my last 2 visits the service was below average. The wait for food was very long. I ordered the Crispy Calamari and it was chewy and tough. My sushi was good. Any waitress ( she looked 12) was very inattentive and seemed preoccupied. Had to be asked to refill our beverages a fews times. It's really a shame.
__label__2	"food is OK. pizza usually undercooked even when you asked for it well done.
do not get the buff chix pizza it was inedible. but food is OK quick delivery"
__label__2	"From the outside looking in, it looked promising. The  employees were pleasant, however the food wasn't. We walked in thinking that the food was going to be ""authentic"" but the ingredients seemed like they all came from a can. The meat was rubbery & unseasoned. The queso reminded me of movie theatre cheese. Overall, the food didn't seem fresh. The ice cream samples were actually good though. Maybe they should just stick to ice cream."
__label__2	"I guess I just don't get the frenzy over this place. I love fried chicken. I know fried chicken. I know southern sides. None of this made me say wow except finally getting a seat after standing in line for 25 minutes. 

This place is busy, be ready to wait. Prices are okay. The sides are nothing fantastic and to be honest were all pretty bland. Chicken sizes are fairly small. 

There are surely better places to get hot chicken in the area that are not touristy if you look. We should have."
__label__2	Called for an appointment asked if they could do 1:15 they took the appointment and there's 5 other people waiting for their cut when I show up. Why not just say it's going to be 30 minute wait no matter when you show up? They don't respect your time at this establishment.
__label__2	"- Burnt hash browns. By burnt I don't mean crispy. They were nearly all charred.
- My meal didn't have avocado but it was supposed to come with it.
- The poached egg yolks were overcooked and hard
- Underripe, rubbery tomato slices. Really really bad. 

+ Nice server
+ A lot of seating

I called to tell the manager about my experience but he was busy and he didn't call me back."
__label__2	Great view of downtown St. Louis, but the drinks are way too expensive. Even for a rooftop bar at a Hilton.
__label__2	Really didn't enjoy at all.  They need to improve the management side. Not clean at all. Plates were so dirty. Restaurant was not packed but didn't give tables to people. Not organized.  Server was so slow. She didn't come to check us . We even didn't get straws with drinks so had to wait another 5 mins to get straws. Pizza was not even warm. Looks like food was ready but server was so busy with chatting with other staff didn't bring it to the table. Will not go back
__label__2	"First timers and last timers. The restaurant seemed very ""snooty"" and our waiter (while good) pretty much hovered over us like a vulture. My wife had the filet which was ok, but nothing to write home about. I had the porterhouse. It did have good flavor but also had tons of fat in it. I'm sure there are plenty of better (and cheaper) steakhouses in St Louis. Go to one of those."
__label__2	"Since they are still doing work on Love Park, it is actually downright dangerous to walk around parts of the village this year, especially on days where there are large crowds. There are partial open access covers, random handrails that jut out, sandbags, etc.
They should have kept the Village over at City Hall, even if it couldn't have been as big, than try to jam everything in like they did this year. Again, not a reflection on the vendors but on the organization of the event."
__label__2	The server was very friendly and nice but the food was just very subpar. Probably a good place to have beers but if you're looking for good food I would steer you somewhere else
__label__2	"Hubby and I were visiting Nashville and spotted this place close to our hotel. We love Thai so we wanted to give this place a try.  The sketchiness didn't bother us, we just wanted some Thai! 

Service: HORRIBLE. The lady that waited on us seemed like she had an attitude like we were an inconvenience to her."
__label__2	"Awful service and awful food, and ""home"" to the Awful Awful Burger. I was there to watch the championships on Sunday and was very disappointed. The service was terrible, and the table next to me was being very offensive to the women my friends and I were with. There wasn't a manager present to complain to. My burger was crawling off of my plate. My beers took so long to get to my table. If you want a real ""Awful Awful"" burger, skip this place and head downtown."
__label__2	"We walked in to the room with Cheetos all over the ground from the prior guests. The pool was closed all day even with beautiful weather. The toilet didn't work and they made us plunge it with no apology just a ""should have told us sooner"". The customer service was not good. Just spend the extra $30 for a different hotel, it'll be worth it."
__label__2	Sorry I just don't get this place. Food was okay (sauage lentil soup, ham & cheese sandwich plus potato salad that I paid extra for), but extremely simple and uninspired. The atmosphere good old boy cheap. What can I say it can be another 8 years before I come back.
__label__2	This place was recommended, when I was looking for a good NY style pizza. After some errors with the ordering system, we called in the order. Ordered a hand tossed, and a NY style. The hand tossed was just ok, not worth the extra distance for pickup. The NY style, very disappointed sauce was very sweet, and the pizza was not close to NY style.  Domino's does a better job with their Brooklyn (and that's not saying much)
__label__2	The pick your own fruit is a mess with rude staff that are ready to charge you more in a heartbeat.  Also, they make you feel like a criminal if you have stuffed your box with berries...no seriously.  Prepare to go pay more. Picking out in the field....guess what you don't have to pay labor for the hour so take that into account.  Will be back but anticipate the stupidity.
__label__2	Had delivery from here. NOT IMPRESSED. Food was cold and chicken was DRY. My chicken loving kids would not eat it, and my husband and brother could barely choke their down. The only reason for a second star was that the wrap I got was not bad, although I had to drown it in Chalet sauce because the chicken was so dry.
__label__2	The ambiance is really nice and the drinks are good. But the food, however, is way too expensive for the quality. If you want to impress someone (ahem), then go on ahead but otherwise, you'd better of with Mizu for just sushi.
__label__2	"Service was great but for the food, I've definitely had better. I found the meats too overcooked, as I like my beef medium to medium rare. 

The fried rice was way too salty. It felt as if it was drowned in soy sauce. However, the salmon was tasty. I'd recommend to get the salmon or chicken if you end up coming here to dine. 

Overall, I still enjoyed my time here with my family as they make it interactive while they are cooking the food in front of you. However, I do not think it's worth coming back for."
__label__2	Located too far from the strip   Free shuttle runs 2-10pm only.  Swimming pool access sucks.  Have to walk down three flights of stairs to get to pool area.  No convenient access for disabled.  Only thing close by is Chevron and Denny's 4 blocks away. Room was clean.  Small casino adjacent, but won't  be staying here again
__label__2	Competent, friendly staff. Outrageous prices. I'd rather get cancer than pay what I did for such a minor removal. Vote socialist today, vote single payer, and let's get rid of health care as 'industry'.
__label__2	Friday 7 pm slow service time, my food was sitting in service window getting cold. Staff standing around yacking. Had to send back for re heat.
__label__2	"How to sum up my late night experience at Little Pete's....? If you're stopping in after midnight, you're bound to find an eclectic crowd of party kids, club goers, wanna-be socialites, and anyone else who has been drinking since sundown. You will probably be called ""Hun"" by the waitstaff. They have an actual cigarette machine. Great vanilla milkshake but the huge, starchy steak fries leave a lot to be desired. Cash only."
__label__2	The food delicious. Atmosphere nice except for the rude bartenders. Shame. Not friendly not helpful.
__label__2	"This is probably my favorite play area. The kids loved it, and it's cheap! The staff were helpful and friendly. If a game wasn't working they immediately came to help.  
The two stars I am giving is due to the staff working in the food court. I wish I have a better word to describe them other than GARBAGE!"
__label__2	I ordered a California AVOCADO salad with grilled shrimp (additional $2.50) through UberEATS.  I received a salad with no avocado and 1 piece of shrimp.  They earned an extra star because my one quarter sized piece of shrimp was pretty tasty and UberEATS customer service processed a full refund.  Can't tell you if the whole salad was good or not because I didn't eat it.  Definitely not worth $11 for 1 Salad and definitely will not order from them again.
__label__2	No phone support. Go figure. When you go inside and finally do find someone to answer your questions, its something you don't want to hear. Extremely overpriced.
__label__2	It's unfortunate. Steamed vegetable was raw, brown rice was hard, chicken was tasteless. But staffs were friendly.
__label__2	"Experience was mediocre to the point that I won't go back:

The restaurant is extremely! packed and all the diners are crowded into two small rooms.

Hard to get the attention of the servers - on top of that, they are pretty rude.

Food is decent, but I'll choose to go to larger, more hospitable BYOs where the food is just as good or better."
__label__2	Very disappointing tonight. We waited 35 minutes before our appetizer came out, then our dinners were right behind it. All dinners were room tempature. The manager came out and took care of our bill.
__label__2	Horrible service. The guy making my food had the worst attitude smh, last thing you want when you looking for freaking yogurt.
__label__2	Good service although we felt a bit rushed. the Blue Tuna appetizer was good and we enjoyed the bread and homemade hummus. however, our meals were slightly warm when they came out and not worth the price.
__label__2	I ordered the crab sandwich. It was meh. I would pay $5 at most. Waitress was very attentive. Would I go back.. No.
__label__2	I feel bad for posting this, but I really don't know what the hype is about this place. It's cute and clean inside, but the food is not Vietnamese. This is extremely Americanized and the pho they serve here is not how pho actually tastes. Miss Saigon on Charlotte Pike is how real Vietnamese food should taste like.
__label__2	Ordered takeout T-bone Steak, Fries, and steamed Broccoli. I received 5 tiny and burnt flecks of Broccoli hidden under my French Fries. If you ran out of Broccoli, you could have given me a substitution!
__label__2	It is what it is....It's a diner, a greasy spoon a local hangout? The food is less than ok except for the bacon. The bacon was the worst I've ever had! The scrambled eggs were over cooked and obviously not attended to because they looked like a failed omelet. The toast was burnt. The bright spot was the hash browns, but then again how can you screw up hash browns??? The waitresses are polite and fast. The place is dirty and has terrible decoration. If I come back it will be for a carry out burger.
__label__2	This was my first food truck experience and it was not good. I had flour tortillas with chicken and pork with 'fried' cheese. It was so burnt that I had to have them remake it. Still not the best. Friends said that food is usually better, but none of us finished what we ordered due to the quality. Food was served hot and service was somewhat fast, but unfortunately I will not be eating from their truck again.
__label__2	Bad experience. Had coffee & pastrys outside brought all plates & trash in and cashier told me I placed items in the wrong place that I needed to put them in the bin on a cart. Meanwhile she was standing there not busy and I tipped her earlier. So she basically told me to bus my own table, I should have gotten my tip back from the jar!
__label__2	The doctors are good.  Only if the staff would answer the phone... Got answering machine and then dropped off without speaking to anyone,. Left voice message and don't get call back...
__label__2	With so many amazing sushi restaurants in Nashville, this was a huge disappointment.  We came here while staying in the area, the tables were sticky and,  generally, it didn't seem to be clean throughout.  This made eating the sushi and rolls beyond challenging.  Very  unappetizing.  If you want truly inspired sushi and Asian dishes, go to Virago downtown!!
__label__2	Totally don't understand the reviews of this place. We went based on yelp, which is generally a good idea.  Portions were good, but dishes were mediocre and not worth the money.  I would prefer Morimoto, Alma de Cuba, Fogo de Cho..
__label__2	Like others, I want to love this place but the prices are high and the donuts didn't impress me.  No where to sit and eat your donuts, so they have to be for takeout.
__label__2	Really didn't like it. Me or my mom. Got a hash and an omelette - rubbery and bland. Not gonna come back.
__label__2	This restaurant can have great food, however you never get it in a timely manner and it may be cold. When the restaurant first opened it was appropriately staffed , enough cooks , enough servers great food. It is obvious that The managers or owners aren't paying attention any longer. I believe the food could still be great if they were not always so understaffed. It is too bad it's a place I loved to frequent in the past
__label__2	Tried this place with my Groupon. Im always happy to try new places! Sunday late afternoon it was pretty quiet. A few people inside watching tv seemed like regulars and were pretty cool to chat with. The place looks a little run down and older, lots of webs and dust especially on the video game area. Staff was friendly, food came out fast, pizza was good.
__label__2	I have been here to look at the space to rent it for a large scale event as well as a spectator for Roller Derby. It looks so nice on the outside and the halls around the center are nice as well, but the inside where you are viewing your event... or concert is just OK to me. Nothing special.
__label__2	I expected a little more. $22 or whatever it was for a buffet isn't bad in retrospect, but the food tasted like microwaveable pre-made frozen meals. Other than some steamed vegetables, it wasn't too good. Pretty bland for my taste, and my chicken was pink. I've had better school cafeteria food. A decent selection I guess, but I'm sure you can find a better buffet literally anywhere else. At least the water was good :-)
__label__2	The Wifi never worked, wasted about 30 minutes trying to login. Worker downstairs was new, didn't know how to login either. Room was ok, for that price one should not expect too much. My room was right in front of the elevator. Why? Who knows. There was a lot of noise but fortunately when it got late it got quieter.
__label__2	Service was great. Restaurant was like dining at any American restaurant. Food tasted pretty good ....until it came backup. Got really bad food poisoning after dining here Jan 1 2020. Came to check reviews and saw someone else posted they also got food poisoning. Someone needs to sanitize the kitchen or check their food.
__label__2	Not my first choice of places to eat in the first place but my boys like playing the games on the tablets.  Our server was extremely impersonal and less than thrilled to help. My drink sat empty for quite a long time while waiting for our order. Our tablet was dead when we got to the table and when I went to pay with it the order was wrong. Food was par for Chilis but nothing great.
__label__2	We have been here a few times in the past few years. I have to say the quality, quantity and service have all declined. There is a waiter there always seem stressed even he only has a few tables to serve. He gives short answers to questions and never say welcome, hi or thank you. The pho is way too salty and the bean sprouts are not fresh. We will stop going there.
__label__2	"Food was pretty good, service was horrible. 

The restaurant wasn't very full, there was a large party of us and had the buffet. 
It took 20 minutes to bring my first drink. We had to track service down and I asked for water 3 times before getting any! 

They could have easily sold us all 2 more drinks each, making a ton of money plus tips but they lost out."
__label__2	A truly ordinary experience for me and my better half.  The turkey and dressing was pricey ($14) had too much sage and did not include cranberry sauce (!). The bison burger was overcooked and a trifle gamey for my taste.  The onion rings were not greasy (a positive) but also did not have much flavor (too much breading). Our server was pleasant and reasonably efficient.  For a total of fifty bucks for lunch (tip included), it was an underwhelming experience.  We will not return to Ted's Montana Grill.
__label__2	Multiple visits over the past few months.  Service has been polite but extraordinarily slow.  Beverage quality is consistent with other Starbucks locations but turn around on orders needs to be greatly improved.  Not the best place to stop when in a rush.
__label__2	This was my first time going and I have been looking forward to coming here for quite some time. I loved the atmosphere and the service was good. The steaks were not. I ordered the ribeye and had to make several passes through it with the knife. It was tough and so was my wife's filet. The potatoes au gratin were so so, not great but not bad just there. The bread served with the meal was actually the highlight of the meal.
__label__2	"whooole lotta nothing.  employees seem to have absolutely zero interest in doinh business.. really stuck up their own butts.  the OWNER acted like i was sprouting a second head out of my shoulder when, after looking through the entire rock / pop, country, and folk sections i asked him where i should look for townes van zandt.. proceeded to suggest i check under ""V"".. or ""Z""... -_-  prices are also set to the same level as they were like 30 years ago."
__label__2	"Mad Mex truly caters to the college scene with their happy hour specials (especially the Big Azz Margaritas).  I recall many a days where I have regretted getting more than one.  Their giant vats of a frozen margarita mix is pretty disgusting but will give you a buzz (and hangover) for cheap.  

Go for the half off wings happy hour.  Their sauces will get your mouth burning.

We all may be drunk off of the margaritas but did anyone notice that it's really called ""Mad 4 Mex""?"
__label__2	"Typical bad diner food. Over fried and dried out... Not to mention over priced. 
Kids meals are a good deal though...$6.50 for the drink, meal and desert. 
Waiter was nice... Only reason I gave a 2 star not a 1 star."
__label__2	"Although Quiznos is a franchise and their meal standards are to the same across the board I wouldn't bet on getting your favorite kind if sub at this location. 

The staff was not polite, they did not talk at a volume at which you could hear them behind the counter, nor did they even greet me when I came in. 

My sub tasted okay but it certainly didn't have anything extra to it... Nor was it handled with care. 


Thumbs down to the staff at this location."
__label__2	We called in an order. And still had to wait 20 minutes after we waited the time we said.  They were out of several menu items. And several different types of soda. Along with crew members arguing and semi threatening each other's.
__label__2	Honestly this place used to be fantastic,,Years ago.   But their pastas with fish and shellfish all taste the same like they opened a can of tomato soup and tried to call it a sauce .  So many other places have better food.  There menu used to be fantastic but it's just not anymore.
__label__2	Very cool location and I've never had an issue with the service.  The food is bland and very average, they also serve unreasonably small portions. The sides come in the small black plastic cups that restaurants give extra ketchup in. Overall the food is overpriced and underwhelming, but it is a nice venue.
__label__2	"As a 35-year customer of Village Inn I was very disappointing to find out that you suddenly stopped giving free pie Wednesdays to take out customers.
We typically  spend more on take out than we do when we eat in the restaurant. Yours is  a very competitive business and we're considering going elsewhere even after all these years.  Hope you change your policy"
__label__2	If someone turns on the shower it sounds like your shower is on. Walls/ceiling are paper thin.
__label__2	Very Very disappointing!!! I am still in shock because this used to be one of my favorite restaurants.     Customer service is very poor, the spare  ribs was over cooked and dry, the mashed potatoes and Broccoli was cold, I asked for sprite and told the waitress I didn't want ice but she still give me ice and the place is extremely loud!!!    So sad!!!!
__label__2	Shady place wanted to fix all my problems I trusted them. Then blamed me that I did not fix all the problems because they suggested I buy new tires.
__label__2	Prices that are advertised are not what you pay!  I ordered a spicy chicken sandwich.  Advertised as $5.59 for sandwich only and it was actually $6.39 with tax, total was $6.81!  Fix your pricing on your menu or give it to the customer for the advertised rate!  They also forgot to put lettuce and tomato at minimum on the sandwich even after I asked for it!  I had to go back in to have them fix it!  Seriously!  Put what's advertised on the sandwich unless done asks that you leave it off!!!
__label__2	"Went there during restaurant week and had an overall negative experience. Not only was our order brought out wrong twice but middle of the way through dinner there was a Mouse running around the table. When brought up to the waitress she seemed indifferent and took no action. 

Two stars for the great food, but everything else was extremely sub par"
__label__2	Cold fries with cold melted cheese on top. Small, over fried portobello mushroom burger- $12.17-not worth it. Took about ten minutes to receive too.
__label__2	"Today a liw mark for a very unnoticeable sign to indicate that one item wasn't working. 
The other reason. It's more of a bathhouse than a gym."
__label__2	"Bad morning for them. Not terribly busy when we entered but took almost 40 minutes for two breakfast orders that were served wrong.
Asked for eggs sunny side up and have no idea what I got, looked like two poached that they fried to cover up the mistake. They and the plate were soaking wet and rubbery beyond being edible. Same with a side of French toast, maybe thirty seconds on the grill? No where near cooked. Asked for manager and she politely agreed and comped the entire order.

I then had to go get breakfast somewhere else..."
__label__2	Been to Stout Burgers twice, we were really excited to get a burger place in the Brentwood area. The burgers were fine but the service is what killed it both times. Very inattentive, got orders incorrect both times. Cool little space.
__label__2	I am rather disappointed, I wasn't even able to finish my breakfast. I had asked for my bagels toasted, which did not happen. Also, there was very little cream cheese on my bagel. In the end, I suffered through one and a half dry and chewy bagels.
__label__2	I had a coupon for a free sandwich. I ordered  pulled pork and the sauce that the employee recommended.   It had a good taste but it was so small! Almost like a slider.   I would have def felt a little ripped off if I purchased it.
__label__2	We had never tried this place before and while the food was good the service was very unprofessional. We had our server rush us through our orders even when we weren't certain what is was we wanted. Huge turn off. Service is an important part of the experience; the staff needs better training in customer service skills. May or may not return.
__label__2	Stopped here traveling back home from a road trip and I wasn't impressed. It was super crowded and the place is the size of a box. I got the chicken cheesesteak (maybe I should've got the beef). It had no flavor when I got home I had to try and dress it up. That still didn't do it...they owe me gas money for wasting my time. I gave them two stars because I'm a nice person
__label__2	Did not care for the quality of meat used on this philly, which was disappointing! Fries are also different from what was pictured but were pretty good. Reminds me of a larger version of Checkers fries without the seasoning.
__label__2	Disappointed in carpet choices at this location. Looking for wine themed 4x6. Guess I'll try another location.
__label__2	"$5 for cold fries and not sure what's going on with the product but was the worst cheesesteak I've had at Pats and one of the worst anywhere. Is it because it's 11am? Not sure but bread was not fresh, meat grisly and fat running off the sandwich. 
Big Misteak (to use the words of Pats) today!"
__label__2	"Meh. I remember going to them years ago and they were pretty good, was happy to have one open close by...

Walked away with a very different experience this time, food was very disappointing. I had a chicken dinner that reminded me of a large chicken nugget, was able to cut with the side of my fork rather than needing a knife.

The people in my party also were not impressed with their hamburgers. The fries were ok...

Not visiting again, there are too many choices that serve real chicken for the same price or less..."
__label__2	"This is my most uncomfortable post. I have been eating at CAKE for over six years. For breakfast I have favorites, for lunch I had to go to's;  So imagine my shock when the other day while enjoying my magical lunch, I watched a woman of color be actively ignored while three white women who came in after her, were helped at the bakery counter. 
Thanks for the great meals, CAKE but I will no longer be coming back in; my appetite magically disappeared."
__label__2	Mediocre job. Asked for the simple wash interior and exterior. Ended up paying $35 for some reason with a $5 charge for detail? Didn't even have the energy to argue. Won't be coming back
__label__2	"i wanted to love coop's...especially for the jambalaya that i've heard so much of...

however, it just wasn't good based on many normal things to be expected from food in general.  the jambalaya was cold, dry, and pasty.  i was so excited to try it too, i read so many internet reviews about this place.  left disappointed.  

very good cajun fried chicken though."
__label__2	"Dirty, have not maintained anything, and unaccomodating. The pillows, if you can call them that, feel like 10 pieces of construction paper. Cracks in tiles, holes in shower grout, hard mattresses, bugs. The stove is from 1973. Market is cash only.

We asked for a late checkout and they could only allow an extra 30 minutes. There were 6 cars in the parking lot. And somehow I doubt they have a sold-out random Wednesday ahead. 

Will never stay here again."
__label__2	"I think the lack of customer service is apparent in this shop. I think it's unfortunate that this was the case-and not only by some of the 'welcome' staff but also by the management-Michelle.
My consultant was very sweet, helpful and knowledgable-Patricia. 
But I would rather pay a little more for a dress and get all around customer service."
__label__2	The fish and chips are not good.  Not even a little bit good. They don't understand the basics of deep frying and it's just not good.  It doesn't matter if they feel like they have it figured out because of their name.  I'm sure some like it, I sure don't.
__label__2	Good looking place, most of the employees are very friendly but the prices are outrageous ! Quality is very good but look around for better pricing from out of the way Italian bakery's. The name and the dumb following's praises have gone to the owners heads.
__label__2	Trains - My Cousin Vinny! Right next to train tracks. Train whistles late at night and early morning hours before sunrise. Room floor doesn't matter.
__label__2	As a person who had never heard of this place before I visited the Philadelphia area. I'm so glad they don't have these where I'm from. The food had no taste and everything was over priced. I'm still dumbfounded on this place is so popular.
__label__2	"This place used to be so much better, but after the 2nd time eating here within the year I am just giving it 2 stars.  The place needs up dating, and so does the food.
I was surprised to find sugared cashews in my shrimp dish, which really did much to up the taste, but overall the whole thing was............um  tasteless."
__label__2	We did not like most of the food we ordered (we went group of eight). Soups and stews were not good, fresh oysters not so fresh. Crab cakes are fine, bear is good. Scallops are ok.
__label__2	Designer Marybeth needs to have better people skills.  Told job would be done first week of December.  room not done until the first week of the new year with issues on first inspection.  Chris and Mary beth  both Have told flat out lies to me and the older home owners daughter.  Beware of J and m
__label__2	Very poor service, sat there for 15 minutes, not even a signal of the fact that you were there. Others came in and got waited on. I can understand how that can happen, but they seem to be quite unorganized.
__label__2	"They really try to go for a fancy/European vibe, but to be honest it was a breakfast buffet and felt very much like a breakfast buffet place (but pricier) ):

Got a bagel with cream cheese which was meh, but the buffet didn't look super appetizing so me and my friend skipped on that.

One plus is that the waiter was extremely nice!"
__label__2	"Met a friend there to""over indulge"" on Fat Tuesday..my wild mushroom hamburger was much more a sloppy cheese burger than wild mushroom. I could barely taste the mushrooms as I hurriedly ate my burger before the cheese slipped right out off the bun! The Kahlua cocoa coffee cheesecake made up for the burger but then I looked down & saw a small roach crawl from our table to another on the floor! Yuck!"
__label__2	Excited to try this place for Chinese New Year but the take out had a couple pieces of meat and then all fried onion in the Mongolian beef. I just through out a massive pile of all onion! The Beef and broccoli was the same few bits of beef at top then all broccoli. We were very disappointed with these meals. The general tsos and orange chicken was fine in the see through containers but in the white boxes it's rather deceiving. So sad.
__label__2	Food was good. Kitchen VERY SLOW! Waiter was friendly. Five different people were bringing out the food and not knowing which table it belonged too. We were four in our party and there was 5 minutes between each of our entrees delivered. Will not go back.
__label__2	Large accommodating range but employees are not the greatest. Range wasn't very clean either.
__label__2	This is my first time visit to New Orleans, apparently when it rain here our hotel get flooded, currently the elevators are not working ( had to walk up to the 16th floor), there is no running water ( can't take a shower) & the AC isn't fully running! I'm sure this place would be amazing if everything was working properly but it's not. I hope y'all get things fixed soon because I still have another night here.
__label__2	$19 for a no polish manicure that wasn't even good. I used to go here because it's close by and open on Sunday's. But I won't be back. $19 is ridiculous. They also have a cash only policy for services under $20 which I hate. Tax evasion, anyone?
__label__2	I've always enjoyed this restaurant but tonight, it was awful. I ordered the Artic Char. The fish was way over done, the potatoes were literally burnt to a black crisp and the entire meal was so unbelievably salty. Salt was the only flavor in the whole dish. Disappointing Kingfisher.
__label__2	I was disappointed this time around. Went with J for a beer and on her way back from the restroom, she mentioned that it smelled like sewage. I though she was exaggerating. A few minutes later, I realized that it did smell like sewage. We asked for outdoor seating but there was none, then asked to sit by the bar, which was at the far end from the bathroom. J and I Just had a beer and left after completely losing our appetites. On the plus side, the beer was good.
__label__2	Coffee was very weak.  Might try again but perhaps would not order their coffee.  Also, no customer experience or interaction.  Not even a hello.
__label__2	This place used to be go-to. The last two manicures have been terrible. I came Saturday with my mother and my daughter for mani-pedis. I had made a 5:30 appointment, not knowing they close at 6 on Saturdays. We were rushed through from beginning to end. 24 hours later my shellac manicure was already lifting on 6 of my nails. One is almost completely off. The pedicure, while rushed, was ok. I'm afraid they have lost our business.
__label__2	I got the veggie burrito and it wasn't good. Inside it had frozen vegetables from Kroger's seasoned microwave vegetables. I know because I buy it all the time. The margaritas tasted very strange... I don't think they use tequila. My friend ordered shrimp tacos and she was very disappointed.
__label__2	"My in-laws did at first time claimed this to be the best roasted beef they've ever had, it was probably the great deal and one-time wonder that made them very happy. My trial went totally southwards, all the dishes are ridiculously oily, and I usually enjoy juicy even oily food, however here I am sick of it. The roasted beef is also not very appetizing, too much fat and too rare. 

Do feel bad for ranking them low, they are really nice and give a lot of discounts, however I am not craving for them at all."
__label__2	Ok, I'm giving Pod a higher rating now after having gone here for a fun celebration (accidentally) with friends for my birthday of all days. The orange martinis are good. Stick to those.
__label__2	Best pizza in town, but if you order a pizza and ask for ranch, they forget the ranch every f@#%ing time and its annoying as hell
__label__2	Service was very poor, waitress didn't seem to know anything about the food and she seemed like she had no interest in being there. Had the chicken burger with fries and it was on the low end of typical pub food. Atmosphere was blah and the only patrons were 60++ or sketchy gambling types. The price is cheap but you get what you pay for. Left very unsatisfied.
__label__2	My husband and I have been regular customers of the restaurant for several years.  It has a great atmosphere and wonderful wait staff, however, just recently they have decreased their portion size and their prices have either remained the same or increased. When I shared my concerns with management, I was told they were sorry I had a bad experience however, they believe they are on the right path forward.  I believe their response was more disappointing than the small portion sizes.
__label__2	All I will say is double check the receipt. Mine went from $67 to what it should've actually been, $43.
__label__2	I've really enjoyed Noodles&Co at other locations, so this was a surprising punch to the Johnson, as they say. It was really busy when I went there for lunch, so I wasn't surprised to wait a while. It took about 25 minutes after ordering to get my food, which was annoying but I could see the cooks were busting ass to keep up, so okay no big deal. But the food sucked! It was like 95% penne and a few slivers of onion and tomatoes. No flavor. Bummer.
__label__2	I will give it a try again and order a bowl or salad....they did look good...but this trip I  got the oliver burger, so bland, I mean no flavor at all, and way to much stuff on it, just too big and messy....I never use salt but I did tonight.   Not a good burger place
__label__2	The service was better than the review indicate, but the food was too expensive for what it was. Besides the smallness of the dishes, the food seemed hastily prepared. Additionally, the five dishes ordered all came out within 10 minutes. While the food was okay and the atmosphere was nice, the prices were ridiculous compared to the rushed-tasting food.
__label__2	"Everyone always raves about this restaurant. 
I really did not enjoy the food at all. I ordered the turkey pesto sand which and tortilla soup and I thought the food was very bland, my mother ordered a grilled cheese and broccoli cheese soup and it tasted like nothing. There was no flavor at all. I would not recommend."
__label__2	Good food but not great; especially for waiting for 90 minutes. Not sure why there are so many good reviews. But all that can be overlooked if the service wasn't so horrible. Total apathy. Just do yourself a favor and pick one of the hundreds of other awesome restaurants in NOLA.
__label__2	Complicated ordering process. Pastries here. Hot line there. Menu items at the cashier (who was making salads and not available for several minutes).  Greasiest bacon I've seen in quite some time. Two people with nothing special, regular coffees, $26. Too much $ for too little service and quality. Used to be much better back in the day.
__label__2	I've been here 3x over the years. Big orders and small. Overall score with my staff, 50-50. But yesterday was not so good. They put hot peppers on w/o my asking. The cheese was paltry, they strain it into pieces and call it provalone. Very bad. The broccolirabe was in lumps, too peppery and too salty. Stay simple. Not the sandwich I've come to enjoy.
__label__2	This place sucks as a karaoke bar. Waited one hour to sing......drank 5 beers. This DJ sang more than anyone else. It should be a karaoke bar...not..let's hear the DJ sing. FN waste of time.
__label__2	Great atmosphere but my friend and I felt the food lacked a lot of flavor. It was just ok. The service was good.
__label__2	Fish tacos were fishy...  Tasted like the fish tacos you get far away from the ocean, probably frozen and maybe a little old.  Really no excuse for fishy here.  I've been here in the area for about a year and this is my first time getting bad fish tacos anywhere.  This place has the potential to be so great.  Service is getting better.  First couple times I was here, it was not great.  I guess people come for the music and drinks, not the food.  My advice to them is to fix the food, they are sitting on a gold mine.
__label__2	I recently ordered takeout from this restaurant. The chicken was extremely overcooked and dry. I have to say that when I walked into the restaurant to pick up my water everything in the restaurant looked really really good and smelled amazing. I will most likely give them a second chance. But for now I am not impressed.
__label__2	So I have had this bank for about a week and I am already extremely disappointed. I have yet to be able to make an payments with any company using my debit card. I have had an issue with the ATM both times I tried to use it. I had to open this bank due to my car loan being through them. If you pay your auto loan without having an account with them they charge a 3.5% fee.
__label__2	"I recently ordered the pork chops and was very disappointed with the meal.  There was more fat on the plate than meat.  The flavor was fine, but not very appetizing with all the fat left on the meat.  
My wife ordered a veggie pita and not much flavor.  
We were there a few weeks earlier and ordered the lamb kebob dinner and thought it was too spicy and just didn't like the flavor.
I'm not sure if we'll go back, but running out of Greek places in the area."
__label__2	The blonde barista with short hair was incredibly rude and confrontational. We are from out of town and didn't know where to put our dirty dishes ( the dirty dish bins were hidden out of our sight.) She loudly called me out and asked that I turn around and go get my dirty dishes and put them away. Very embarrassing for patrons.  She was rude with several other people in my party as well. The rest of the servers were pleasant.
__label__2	Bad service at bar. Food was just ok and overpriced. Crudo was more grapefruit than fish.  So many better options in Nashville...don't waste your time.
__label__2	Not happy with the 1 hour plus wait times back in a office. Most of the time longer. Leave patients in the waiting room instead. There is at least a television and a change of scenery in the lobby.
__label__2	This place is perfect to meet friends and have a few cocktails and appetizers. Service was slow on a Thursday evening. Never were we offered drink refills. Sushi rolls are smaller than in most Japanese restaurants in the area.
__label__2	staff needs more training, rude and incompetent. food was good but overpriced
__label__2	First time...husband's duck was very dry and over cooked. My food tasted really good, but cold. Literally the broccolini seemed like it just came out of the fridge.
__label__2	We had an okay experience at The Ruby Slipper. The dining room was loud and cold. The stuffed French toast and candied bacon were great, the florentine omelette was fine, and the chicken sausage was hard as a rock. The servers (we ate at the bar) did a fine job. The food, in general was overpriced, so we won't be back. There are dozens of other options in the CBD and FQ.
__label__2	I am extremely disappointed in tonight's service. Server, not great. Food, very wrong. Didn't come out together. Steaks totally wrong temp. No acknowledgement by server, no manager came to table. Highly recommended to my family traveling from Bahrain for my daughter's wedding and it was not a memorable experience to say the least. Lobster bites, hush puppies were awesome and blue crab stuffed hogfish was delish (we know blue crab, live on Chesapeake bay!)
__label__2	Called the Cafe at 1:52 to see if I could come over to eat lunch and was informed that their kitchen was already closed !! Probably not a good way to win over customers. Closed before your published hours. As a new business on Hernando Beach you might want to serve folks who come into your Cafe prior to the published closing. Didn't even get an opportunity to sample their food.
__label__2	Beware of hidden fees, costs etc - Sales Mgr does games with discussin monthly payments & not actual costs. Don't make a mistake by just signing IF they agreed to a bottom line number - FYI its not the bottom line.  I didn't read fine print - go elswhere they don't care and its all about the money for them
__label__2	I tried to love this place but their vegetarian dishes are TERRIBLE. I've tried the ital stew and the spinach and groundnut stew so far. They are both incredibly bland. The veggies in the ital stew were mushy and overdone.  When I told the waitress that the ital stew was bland, she said that it was because it's vegetarian. *pause* what? I've had plenty of vegetarian Jamaican food that was flavorful. Avoid this place if you're looking for vegetarian dishes and walk down to Caribbean Delight. They do a much better job.
__label__2	Horrible service, good prices, great portions. BYOB. You need to be willing to wait and wait and wait.
__label__2	SLOW -- drive thru always had 9-10 cars , decided to go in to the dining area and was immediately greeted by a smell of urine coming from the bathrooms , and then decided to promptly leave. Another occasion I decided to wait it out in the dining area and it took 15 minutes for the one item I ordered
__label__2	"Not a fan. Surprised this is a Hilton property at all. Stayed in RM 308 which is in need of updating and fresh paint. The rug needs vacumning and there was someone else's left overs in the refrigerator. The bathroom light was so dim, I asked for new bulb. Then the light fixture broke. The black hairdryer bag had white stains all over it. 
I think the pictures show it best."
__label__2	"The store is fine until you ask the very young crew for a request for your sandwich.  It is met with a bit of like you should not ask.  Also, they have that new team structure, where no is in charge, and so there is no one to go to issue a complaint.  Fairly good, but was better in previous years.
Go for the cookies and grab a soda.  Sandwiches are mediocre."
__label__2	Great to have a place focused on being meat-free, plant-based, vege but everything's made of standard vege brands that you get in the grocery store. They don't really branch out into actual 'chef' territory. Unfortunately the owner even said they weren't ready for it. Hopefully this will improve.
__label__2	The food is pretty good however the place just seems understaffed. 15 minutes waiting in line for their single order taker to take my order and 30 minutes waiting for my to-go order of 2 tacos and a side of pico.  And they forgot my hot sauce. Perhaps they prioritize dine-in orders but this has been my experience for my last several visits. Unless you have a lot of time, there are other places to eat.
__label__2	Good luck during covid. Customer service from the waiters is non existent. We waited forever for just water and then waited forever again for my beer. Overpriced meals in my opinion: $33 for a steam pot that was extremely overcooked and missing all flavor. Beers were barely cold at best. Bathrooms were in need of service.
__label__2	Ugly and dirty. No crown room in concourse C...boo. Not much of a food select once you go through security. Easy to get in and out off and it's near the big sleazy. That's my two points
__label__2	omg the food is horrible,  the service is in need of help. i would rate this resturant as a low number two. please be caution when dinning at this resturant you will be disappointed.
__label__2	"Do yourself a favor, go somewhere else if you want a steak, but I know you will go cause of the hype. So get one try it out and if you have any sense of what good food is you won't be back.

P.S. 
For what's its worth Pat's steaks is a little bit better in my opinion, but still not recommended"
__label__2	Overheard some workers talking, and apparently they don't know what MDMA is. Also one of them said he quit smoking weed but then he forgot my order so...
__label__2	Chicken Cali sandwich used to taste good a few years ago. Now the chicken has no flavor , small size for an $6 price point, and the guacamole isn't that good. This used to be served with sliced avocado. I'll just go to chick fil-a up the road for a better chicken sandwich.
__label__2	The burger is hard like a microwave patty and the fries are bland. Only good part was the drink and salad.
__label__2	Unfortunately we had very mediocre take-out last night. Our wings were so burnt that they were black, Cuban sandwich and french fries were soggy, and we asked for dressing on the side with our salad, dressing came on.  Salad was also made with iceberg lettuce which is just not acceptable. Overall food was extremely mediocre and we will not be returning.
__label__2	The only reason that I am giving this 2 stars and not one is that they do have lovely pieces. The customer service and the ordering process; however, is one of the most frustrating that I have ever experienced. I ordered a lamp and waited for over a month to get it when I was told that it would take 10-14 days to be delievered. When I called to inquire as to the cause of the delay, I was told that the item was delayed in transit. I received no notification of this. Their refund policy is also atrocious.
__label__2	"$9 Caesar salad shouldn't taste like mayonnaise.
Bad customer service to make me pay after expressing my distaste."
__label__2	The sushi was good but the service is awful. Didn't get drinks for 15 minutes, never got the soup that was included in the special, lost what was left of my appetite when my friends had to kill the roach crawling across the top of the table.
__label__2	Felt let down by our visit here. Started with bruschetta, and found the tomatoes definitely soggy and old. This was on a Sunday evening, but I would expect fresh tomatoes regardless. Bruschetta is so simple and delicious, this was really unappetizing. I ordered the pizza, can't remember which toppings but it came with very few toppings anyway. My partner got meatballs and spaghetti and they were average. Beautiful space and lovely staff, but the food will not bring us back.
__label__2	We did the 5 in 1 tour, It was ok... a lot of quiet walking. I really thought it would be more informational and or entertaining. I learned a lot about my tour guide and not so much about New Orleans.
__label__2	Unfortunately, this place has faded badly. It was once the kind of place I would gladly take clients. Not anymore. The chairs are stained, the menu is sparse, the food available is mediocre. I asked for a glass of water twice before concluding it wasn't going to appear. I'll check back in a year to see if it has improved.
__label__2	The entire place smelled like an old bar rag or dirty dish towel, and the carpet looked like it has never been cleaned since the original Friendly's opened in 1935. We left and had bug bites on our ankles and were itching, immediately stripped down and put our clothes in the wash when we got home. Whole staff looked like they were plucked out of the sewers of Kensington. Burger was a 10/10 though, and our sever was really nice, though her pupils were the size of dinner plates! Will go back to a friendlys again one day probably, but def not that one.
__label__2	Bartenders took 15 minutes to make our drinks, for the waitress to serve, eventhough it wasnt a busy day. Burger was slightly overcooked and the portions for the side was small.
__label__2	This place is consistently poor.  I go here every now and then because its close to a friend's house.  The service is soooo slow, this time they were out of many of the beers and vodka.  The staff has always been nice, but don't seem to be well trained.
__label__2	"Service is God awful.  The Boys invite friends in and they curse too much to bring my family in.  The burgers are so so, maybe a notch above fast food.  Not sure if i can say it's worth a try - when there's so much better out there.

This Will NOT make my burger best list.
--RibChamp"
__label__2	11/27/06. Either I'm getting more picky, or this branch of the chain has gone downhill. A couple of years ago, I was thrilled with the chicken piccata. But a couple of days ago, it was cold and insipid. The previously delicious bread was stale. Olive oil for dipping was hard to come by. The restaurant was half empty at what should have been a busy time. What happened?
__label__2	Very poor value for your hard earned money. Small portions, above average prices and the food is not even authentic Korean food.
__label__2	"Eh.
Went to this place after seeing it on Guy's show.  Three of us ordered different meals.  I tasted each one.  The food was quite bland, and the atmosphere lacking.  But the bill total was that of a fine dining experience.
It's not horrible, but not great either."
__label__2	"We drove almost 20 miles after seeing the reviews, but it's not worth the drive. Only one waiter taking the orders for all tables. Sushi was OK. Dynamite Alaska was horrible, never ate such tempura sushi. Which was bought to us after lying there on sushi bar for 10 mins.
Chicken appetizer was not good.
Two stars are only for Rocky , which was really good and honoring 10% yelp discount."
__label__2	Cocktails good. Ambiance good. However my favorite is Prime Rib, and for the second time it was tough, and tasteless! My companions all enjoyed filets, so guess that answer don't order the prime rib!  Unfortunately I'm used to House of Prime Rib in San Francisco. So I'll just have to drive 5 hours for mine!'
__label__2	"EVERY SINGLE TIME I have placed a order to pickup, or delivery on Doordash, IT IS MISSING SOMETHING, or it is completely the wrong thing.  Happened again today. I am BEYOND over this place.  It is a shame, food is amazing but I do not want to ""roll the dice"" when I order something."
__label__2	I'll just say it - this place is weird.  I like the classic feel but not the modern pricing.  The food simply doesn't live up to it.  I had the pork chop, it was ok, not anything special.  We had multiple servers, multiple people stop by and ask us if everything was ok (before food arrived), even gentleman wearing dishwashing aprons came by to interrupt our conversation.  I get it, this place is new.  But I don't know, just an awkward dining experience overall that will prevent me from returning.
__label__2	The food quality is OK, but it is very overpriced for a diner. I'd highly recommend traveling a couple more miles to Apanay.
__label__2	"Rather disappointing. All the reviews I read about this place made it seem top notch. Food was average at best. Hot chicken biscuit wasn't all that good. The home made tots are bland tasting. Not sure if it's how they make them, or if they're suppose to be mushy inside. Only good call out, they have Big Red as a fountain drink!! I'm a big fan of Blake, but go to Aldean's, it's better.

PS. Service was horribly slow!"
__label__2	Walked down from bourbon st. Looking for a place for a quick bite that didn't have that permeating party street odor.  Ordered the gumbo. It was long on roux and short on shrimp, sausage and crab but not terrible. Walked past kitchen side on way out and noticed a delivery being carried in including Zatarain's gumbo mix which was a disappointment.  Band was nice but I could have done better gumbo wise with some Yelp research.
__label__2	"Lemongrass used to be my favorite-the Panang curry is great! However my to go order has been incorrect now THREE times in a row. Went back to get the correct order after waiting 15 minutes as they asked, and had to wait close to 40 more minutes before it was actually ready. My order really is not that complicated...just disappointed. Would have been nice to get an apology as well any of these times but I was made to feel more like a burden. 

Still would give the food a 4."
__label__2	Wandered into Crabby Bills and should've wandered right out. Smelled like old grease. Terrible onion rings. Boring shrimp salad. Go to Oyster Shucker instead! First time in St Pete Beach and have been there twice.
__label__2	Average (ish).  Sangria's are WEAK..... Yuk! I had a sirloin steaks/Asiago (ok). Salad Bar (ok), Sweet Potato Fries (perfect)
__label__2	I've had better sushi at a Chinese buffet. It worries me to see an automatic sushi slicer in a sushi 'restaurant'. And rice crispy sprinkled on top of sushi and have it called 'tempura crunch'. And it was overpriced.
__label__2	This food was very bland. Pepper steak with onion was just big chunks of raw onion with a few small pieces of meat. It was pretty much inedible. Wonton soup had no flavor and the wontons were mush. Lo mein was dry and bland. The crab rangoon was good. Chicken with broccoli was ok. Sorry Ching Garden but I will be going to Long River from now on!
__label__2	The food was OK, but the rolls were unusually small?! I've only had sushi a hand full of times but they were never that small. And the wasabi portion witch I expected to be small was unexpectedly smaller then I was even figuring to be.. :(
__label__2	Coffee is good, service is awful. I have never had a worse morning experience.
__label__2	Went their for lunch after a meeting... Very slow service and inattentive. Never got refills because they said they were out of glasses. Mac and cheese and fried chicken are its only saving grace
__label__2	Pizza by the slice was served cold.  Probably pretty good if fresh but hesitate to return.  Must be the only pizza place in town, or being run by newbies.
__label__2	Good sandwiches.  Not worth fighting your way through all of the homeless taking up the outdoor seating or begging/fighting/drinking in front of you.
__label__2	Meh. Went here for a late lunch / early dinner on a Saturday and waited a good 10 minutes for a table despite their being plenty of open & clean tables. I wasn't too impressed with the food and the prices were a little high but hey, they say this place is pretty hip and cool! Prices are a little more than I'd like to pay though
__label__2	Went in today and was disappointed in my server. I had a gift card and used it, then I was trying to ask him how I can tip him cause I have no cash. I would have ordered a desert and paid with my credit card but he was so upset that I didn't have cash that he ripped my gift card out of the book and took off so fast that I couldn't. Since he acted so ridiculous I guess I'll just assume he'll spend my $2 on the gift card later. WHATEVER
__label__2	"Took my hubby for a little treat. Disappointing service, cold soup )both bowls) inattentive server. 

I don't think I'll return."
__label__2	The food was really good, however the customer service was lacking and not the best. Our waiter didn't have much of a personality and seemed a bit annoyed when we had questions regarding the menu. I wouldn't go back as good customer service is high on my list of going back to a restaurant.
__label__2	i ordered the com bo luc lac and it was the WORST I have ever had. Food was only slightly warm and the beef was a gray color with a slight foul taste.
__label__2	What can I say this is you run of the mill bar, nothing to spectacular however it reminds me vaguely of the pub from how I met your mother. The bar itself is usually empty even on expectantly busy nights such a New Years. I used to think this place was the absolute bomb in my late teens but since experiencing more of the Edmonton night life I have to say I have experience better. One very positive comment though, the food and boose are dirt cheap but delicious, great for the college student or stringent spender.
__label__2	$73 shellac manicure took almost two hours and was improperly applied. The polish started pulling from the edges immediately, and it peeled off in less than a week. Not recommended!
__label__2	Stopped in for lunch today. Been there a couple times and was highly satisfied. This time the place was disgusting. We got there about half an hour after opening and floors from night before hadnt been swept. Food debris was all over tables. On the way out we noticed a note taped to the front door. It said they were permanently closing on the 12th (today). So, not sure what is going on with them.
__label__2	We really want to like this place, the staff is really nice and it's conveniently located. Bottom like is it's just too expensive for less than stellar drinks or food. Neat recipes, but we have been underwhelmed by the coffee and tea, particularly for the price.
__label__2	"Smells weird in here. Food was bland. The fried chicken Benedict was not good.
The cinnamon pancake was mushy and undercooked!
The bartenders made our experience great despite the terrible food.
They were informative and very polite and have amazing customer service. They gave a 5 star experiences. But the food was just blah"
__label__2	I hate to say it. I used to love Milanos 5-6 years ago, But recently the quality has gone down on my current pictures as you can see the pizza is very very soggy and sometimes when we do big orders The topping quality is so inconsistent I don't know what happened but I'll be honest the guy that's doing the cashier is a very good guy
__label__2	It was ok. I asked for medium well burger and I got more like medium rare to medium. But the few bites I could take were very good! If we go back I'll ask for well done!
__label__2	Six months later, feeling rather disappointed. Produce selection is insufficient - heaps of winter crops in the summer, several experiences buying moldy berries and mislabeled organic/conventional goods. Bell peppers are routinely labeled as eggplant. Deli staff are always friendly but, again the selection is subpar and they usually close thirty minutes early. Butcher staff are also friendly but, most of their selection is grade one (five being the best). Still grateful this market is open. Hope WF takes the initiative to address these issues.
__label__2	Car (Dodge Journey) was falsely advertised as a 7 passenger with room for 5 suitcases. 7 dwarfs with purses, maybe. Had to return and get a minivan. Price quoted at check-in was $400 higher than quote in reservation. They fixed it when I pointed it out. The car was dirty and tired, and the tank was not quite full.  Staff was helpful enough, but overall, not a good experience, especially for a Gold Member.
__label__2	Just went for the first time, and they had changed their menu, so maybe that was part of our less-than-stellar experience. It took a long time for the food to come out, and steaks were overdone. Price a little high for overall experience. Entertainment was a singing duo that was just too loud to be comfortable. Probably will not go back.
__label__2	Not the best set I have received, the shape of my nails did not match, I didn't get the color I asked for and I was told and paid the amount I was told and was called after I had walked out of the door and one of the employees shouted at me to pay another 10$ I was not aware of. The employees were very kind and the establishment was beautiful, however I would not return.
__label__2	Haven't been to claim jumper in years. It is nothing like I remember it. The steak was over cooked and the macaroni was very plain tasting. The only pleasant part of our meal was our waiter.
__label__2	I do not love their coffee. I drink my coffee black but do appreciate a good speciality drink once in a  blue moon. Their coffee doesn't have a unique taste to me, it's just okay. I just have never enjoyed their speciality drinks either, in my opinion they are way to milky and sugary.
__label__2	The wife and I had brunch here. The service by Kristi was atrocious and the food average.  I would not go back.
__label__2	Great salads and very thin crust pizza. Ordered the cinnamon bread sticks for desert but they put salt instead of sugar on them! I almost choked! They gave us a$10 gift card and were very apologetic.
__label__2	I wanted to buy some syringes, they said they couldn't sell them to me without a prescription because someone supposedly od'd in the restroom that week.. I think they were profiling me because I have a bunch of tattoos and weird hair.  And clean syringes promote health among the community.. shouldn't a company want that?
__label__2	This was disappointing.  Staff was great, trainers knowledgable, just...no wow factor.  Expected more value for the price.
__label__2	Worst delivery of pizza I have ever had. Pizza was cold, not even luke warm. Also ordered the arancini balls and they were terrible. It tasted like a grocery store bought frozen version. Will not be ordering from them again.
__label__2	The service was pretty bad, but their frozen yogurt was pretty decent. Lots of toppings to choose from & the store was pretty clean.
__label__2	If you have never been there before it is confusing. There are no signs explaining that you place your order at the counter then go find a seat . I got salad and ravioli.  For a cob salad it was a good mix . The ravioli was undercooked. Very doughy. It was the same for the person I was with. I did not eat all of mine. I was disappointed . Our food was brought out quickly but also I'm not a fan of eating out of carry out containers. I have no reason to go back.
__label__2	We rented a kayak and it was $18 an hour and we were told we had to stay in the harbor and not kayak to the left. Ummmm to the left is where all the beautiful scenery is. I don't want to rent a kayak and not be allowed to paddle anywhere. I was pretty disappointed.
__label__2	"Taking parents to Indy 500 means I will get to try most of the Indian buffets around the state! 

This was our second buffet out of the 3 we had all weekend and can't say I was a fan, but it wasn't too bad. Compared to Indian food in Chicago, I'd give it a 2-star maybe, but compared to other Indian food experiences in Indiana, it probably earns 3 of them."
__label__2	"This Taco Bell is no longer closed. It has been remodeled and reopen. Kudos to them for trying to make this location more ""modern"" looking but they definitely need to work on cleanliness. The entire dining room is an absolute disgusting mess and it makes me not want to eat here. There are numerous dirty tables and food and debris all over the floor. Perhaps they should work on that."
__label__2	I really wanted to like this place but I had a pretty terrible experience. I ordered take out and the burger was completely raw inside. I did receive a refund but I probably won't try this place again for take out. Maybe I will try again when dining in opens again.
__label__2	Cold Americano, server seemed confused when I ordered a simple coffee. Won't return.
__label__2	Didnt care for this for breakfast at all.  I eat healthy anyway and still didn't like it particularly. Apparently I'm in the minority as it was mobbed.  No idea what the but deal is.  Food was just ok.
__label__2	Tried the smoked salmon and cream cheese bagel with scrambled egg. The salmon was too darn salty. I literally could not finish the the plate because I thought that I would have had a stroke from my blood pressure skyrocketing from the salt. Kidding but no really it was extremely salty, not too clean either. Pretty cool that you can add a cupcake to your meal for $1 and it was worth it!  I tried the wedding cake flavor and it taste homemade and the almond flavor buttercream icing was good too.
__label__2	I love this bar. We have been here several times. The bartender you had here on 12/04/21 at night was terrible. He got engrossed with one customer and forgot others for long periods. It was frustrating.
__label__2	Soaked my feet in ice water. Asked 7 times to raise temp. I not only want this for comfort, but have contamination concerns as well. Prices are not posted which is a red flag in any nail salon. At 28 dollars this is pretty high priced for getting lukewarm water and even colder customer service.
__label__2	I'm so sick of the new lady working the morning drive through I believe her name is Ginny. no matter how many questions she asks about my coffee it still turns out fucked up. And the lines are much longer than usual because of her. PLEASE put her back on night shift.
__label__2	I had a coupon for a free 4 oz (I think) of yogurt. They didn't give me 4 oz for free, like the coupon said. They gave me a percent off each ounce. False advertising! Orange Leaf is a million times better. Much better flavors and staff.
__label__2	The owner and his family were eating in the corner and the amount of smacking that went on at that table was enough to drive anyone crazy! The food was alright, they were kind of stingy with bean sprouts and lime for the pho. I probably wouldn't go back .
__label__2	Tried this location because the other one was freezing and because it's a nice area. Surprisingly, this one was colder and the customer was bad.  Did the all you can eat which is nice but they took a long time getting the first order of meat out. They probably do this so you fill up on the kimchi first so you eat less meat.  Overall it was flat out miserable inside due to the lack of central heating. If you looking for a true third world experience this might be for you.
__label__2	Waited over 4 hours to check into our room and they were completely under staffed. Only compensated with 2 drink tickets for beer or soda. View was nice which is why i gave it 2 stars. Not much to do on site. Pool was wall to wall kids not enjoyable at all. Best thing was the food from the bar was delicious. Would not go back.
__label__2	"Since this store opened things have gone downhill. Not only is the parking lot a DISASTER every single morning, but I just found out, after waiting in line for so long, that they don't carry BISCUITS anymore. Biscuits! I mean, that's a very basic breakfast staple that Dunkin has carried since basically the beginning of time.

Bring back the biscuits and I might tolerate the clusterfuck of a parking lot to spend my money with you again.

Oh, and they stopped carrying onion bagels. WTF?!?!?!"
__label__2	We waited for like 25 minutes to even speak to a server- then we just left:/ shame, we really wanted wings
__label__2	This place food was not the worst, yes it tasted good Because we were hungry but other then that it had so flavor. Nothing was seasoned. They ran out of some drinks we wanted which was very strange and that's me upset. The wait time was short and waiter was good but everything else was very poor
__label__2	I was told that ever since the Covid mandate has been in effect, shopping here has gotten worse. And I can attest to that last part, there are literally no registers open in the evening. The line to the Self check out is both long and awful. Louisiana WalMarts are busy places, but they flow well when they have the right resources. Come back after Covid is my advice.
__label__2	Tried to shew us out of the store before close and closed early. Didn't offer to help with finding anything
__label__2	They only take CASH...NO debit cards. Bummer! Needless to sau, had to turn right around and leave. Next time I will have cash
__label__2	Typical tourist steak joint.  People from Philadelphia do not eat here unless they are drunk at 3 a.m.
__label__2	Didn't really enjoy anything. It's in the mall which is fitting because it is mall food quality. The sandwiches are the most serviceable thing we had. Should be better for the money.  This is not a destination. It's just a place to eat an overpriced salad while shopping.
__label__2	This spot must be possessed to produce mediocre places. I ordered the Korean tacos, but wasn't too impressed that I would come back.  As one would expect, you get two tacos for $8.  I think for 5-6 bucks, I would come back and try something else as I was still hungry after trying this for lunch.
__label__2	"Dropped in for mommas pancakes because I needed them lol
Taking a huge COVID risk because the place was packed and zero
Distancing
In the gift shop area
People crawling all over one another with 20 minute wait

Amway they burnt my pancakes but I wanted to get out of there alive so I ate them anyway

Bye

Anyone let me know of another blueberry pancakes spit please"
__label__2	Have been to the Chopped Leaf in the West end and it is far superior. They always cook the protein as it is ordered, so it is fresh. I ordered the southwest wrap with chicken and the chicken was cold and very chewy. I removed the chicken and ate the rest of the wrap, but won't be going back.
__label__2	Update: came back here with my sister for brunch and it was not good. We arrived a few minutes after opening and they weren't ready so we sat for a bit to give them time to set up. Once they were ready, we explored the buffet and the food was STILL COLD. The mimosas, which were once included in the price of brunch, were charged separately. We decided just not to say anything because we were so annoyed with the terrible service. I would strongly consider going elsewhere if someone recommends this restaurant.
__label__2	"First time here. Went to pick colors for hands and toes. Polishes looked horrible, dull, separated in layers, muddy. Difficult to find any that looked decent. Finally picked two, chose an OPI product for fingernails. Ben did pedi work, Ivy did painting. Then Ivy did manicure. It was ok. She tried to up sell me on two cosmetic products priced at $40 and $70. 
Next day, polish started to come off at fingertips. Day after that I had to take it off, even more polish had come off. This supposedly was the OPI product. 
Will not return."
__label__2	"You ain't foolin' nobody, Timmah!   Putting generic funcky tasting ketchup in premium catchup bottles.  I will not stand for it!

The bar is still the best on the Riverfront if you want to avoid snobbery and idiocy, but I wouldn't recommend eating here.  The food used to be decent, but it's pretty obvious they are just focusing on the alcohol now."
__label__2	The place was almost dead for a Monday night football game. Perhaps it was too cold for some. Had the Pub Chips which were lousy. Nothing but steak fries with nacho cheese. Had the Fish n Chips. Fish good not great. Service was good but waitress knew nothing about downtown Indy.  Would not go back.
__label__2	Horrible experience! Staff was rude and unwilling to cooperate with us and our promotional coupon. Too many restrictions to the promotional coupon that were not listed in the rules. Will not be visiting again.  The food was OK, but the service from the manager, waiters and bartender was horrible.
__label__2	Worst of the Berns empire.  I thought the food was unimaginative and overpriced.  Selection was poor, cocktails were mediocre.  The service was great as could be expected fo m any Berns restaurant.
__label__2	Came in very late at night so couldn't expect much..... But the chicken we ordered was undercooked & the oysters were too funky to be served on any menu. 4% surcharge on cards is whack too.
__label__2	"I was a bit hesitant about the overall concept, but I decided to try something new.  
I thought I was making a reservation on their website but it turns out I was on a 3rd party website.  Unfortunately there were some added fees that literally almost doubled my rate.  The manager couldn't do much about it either.  Doubt I'll use them again."
__label__2	"Not my favorite store to go to - I only use it as a last resort to look for items I wish to purchase. 

Every time I've been here the lines were slow, shelves weren't well stocked, and floor was just messy/unorganized looking"
__label__2	"Clean rooms great poker room but depending what part of the hotel/casino you are at there are different rules regarding face mask enforcement. I wanted clarification so I went to the front desk and asked a heavy set lady using a cane who I should talk to she stated ""the Governor of Nevada"" with a very rude tone. I know the pandemic is tough on everybody but we can still  be professional and civil. I use to always stay at the Legacy but going forward Atlantis will be my new spot."
__label__2	I had horrible service for breakfast with a group of 8.  The food was good, but the service was atrocious.
__label__2	Just keeps going down hill. Flat taps, terrible cooking. Used to love this place 5 years ago. The company got bigger. Margins got thinner. Tale as old time.
__label__2	I come here once a month and Im done with it, the machine always malfunction, its over price, and theres no staff that can override the machine.
__label__2	Back again in Boise and my car isn't ready.  we did tell them what time my plane would land . I don't know what game the rental car corporations are playing at this airport but the only car that is here is the new one on display for sale.
__label__2	The Pad Thai was awful! The noodles were dry with no sauce. For the price, not worth eating.
__label__2	Across from ocean but view severely beloved view . $28 valet simply ridiculous.  Rooms nothing better than holiday inn. No movie channels you pay for and only basic cable. Not everyone wants to go out every night. I will never stay here again. Shocked it's Hyatt. Not worth it . The little local places are way better.
__label__2	Really good double chocolate chip cookies 10/10 recommend BUT the fries are not salty at all let me tell you I am unsatisfied!!!!!!! I liked the chicken tenders though oh and the service was so freakin annoying ok the lady was like WhAt ElSe Do YoU wAnT when we were STILL ordering like scuse me ma'am can your ham and what in the frick frack patty wack is in their coke!!?!?!?! It tastes like full on cinnamon
__label__2	"Customer service was pretty bad at this location. Most of the employees are young kids and try to scam you every second they can. Make sure you do your research prior to arriving at this T-Mobile, because they will always try to add expenses onto your account. As a matter of fact, I specifically told them not to add insurance on the phones or this other ""protection"" plan, and I found out they added BOTH when I went into my account later that evening. The employees are a lot better at other locations"
__label__2	Two stars, 1 for the clean bathrooms, 1 for the touchitunes juke box. Place has no exhaust vents so if you enjoy feeling and smelling like an ashtray this place is for you. The cook looked like he needed to shower and try clean cloths, couldn't pay me to eat here. Draft coors light had floaties..... Nuff said
__label__2	Called and the girl on the phone was really nice talking the order. I ordered a full calzone with fresh garlic and onion with two sides of sauce $17 and change. What I got was essentially a pizza folded in half and baked to the point of being burnt. It's thin, halfmoon and the bottom is black. Flavor sucks - I can't find the fresh garlic at all and its just bland. Really dissatisfied. Not coming here again.
__label__2	Worst latte I ever had. Tasted like water, not coffee. Couldn't finish it.  Frittata was dry, & tasteless. Couldn't finish it either.  Won't be back.
__label__2	Chicken batter not as pictured on their menu. French fires are good. Salad good and the grilled chicken was good as well ( average ). Steak uhhhhh not worth the price. Restroom dirty. Just picked this place cause parking lot was next to the building and I didn't have proper shoe wear to be walking around .
__label__2	"A disappointment.  I know it was Mothers' Day, but an hour and 25 minutes is extreme.  Suspect it was due to their call ahead policy, which was not acknowledged when we asked for the ""anticipated"" wait time.  We were told 30 minutes.  Upon checking at the 35 minute wait, there were only two parties in front of us.  We watched as 6-8 parties were called, following that check-in.  AND the food was adequate, nothing to rave about..oh well, live and learn.  Back to Baja Cafe"
__label__2	Their staff is always friendly and kind, but the food is a hit or miss. Sometimes, their pho (delivered) has been fantastic. Other times, they noodles are cold and dry, and many of the necessary pho accoutrements like basil, Sriracha and jalapeño are missing. Their chicken curry is loaded but was kind of bland. Spring rolls have always been great though!
__label__2	If you are looking to purchase a computer and need sarcasm or very little help, see Microcenter.  I've purchase laptops in the past at this location and have always been bothered by the attitude of the guys working there.  In 27 years supporting people in the IT industry, I would never have an attitude with a customer and talk with this type of subtle sarcasm.  Also, I stood in the laptop area for 15 minutes and not one sales person ask me if I needed help.  I was going to purchase a laptop but will see what Staples or other stores have available.
__label__2	Filthy, crowded, cramped crappy gel manicure. I will say everyone was friendly though. Wouldn't recommend.
__label__2	The gym itself is great and I love the variety of equipment, but the staff is just not helpful. Every time I had with management they showed a lack of care, had to call various times to be able to talk to someone who could help me. For the price they charge this is unacceptable I glad I cancelled my membership.
__label__2	We went on Fathers Day and the only good part was the music. Service , hostess, and food were all lacking. Especially the quality of the food. My waffle was soggy and chicken had no flavor. My husbands was mediocre. Sweet potato pancakes - umm the burnt pecans were the best part.  It's as if they pre cooked and put under a heat lamp.  Music was spectacular.
__label__2	Ok selection. Ok staff. Rude people and not good prices; which I find odd since its a chain?! Again, crappy clothing selection
__label__2	This place has decent reviews on both Google and here, so I was looking forward to trying it.  Definitely the worst Mexican food I've had in Philly.  Maybe they had an off night, but, if so, our entire table of 6 people experienced it.  We ordered queso and they brought our room temperature, bright yellow nacho cheese.  That should have been the sign to get up and leave.  Wayyyy too many good places to eat to give this another try.
__label__2	We got there at 7:00pm they were out of ribs, pork and brisket!  So disappointed, came all the way from Pittsburgh because we heard from family how great their barbecue was.  My husband and son got the catfish which they said was great and I got chicken.  Very tender but still just chicken.  Staff very friendly and service great.  Would give higher stars if we were able to taste a variety!
__label__2	Decent but lacking a quality that one would require for the price. The service was great, college cafe atmosphere but food was meh! The Impossible burger was not even a notch above the Burger King offering: dry, thin and over cooked. Their falafel fries were blackened by some serious frying negligence. The pretzel bun was, well just a regular bun.
__label__2	The staff was extremely rude and pretentious about their beer. I understand being proud of your work but this is different.  Most of all most of the taps were not cleaned recently. Would not recommend.
__label__2	The food is over salted like wayyy over salted where we kinda got dehydrated from it. It was rough. The foods that were not over salted were actually pretty good. The sides and rolls were the best part.
__label__2	Very slow service department. Made an appointment at 1 and they didn't start looking at my car until almost two hours later. It's been three and a half hours and they are just beginning the actual work on the car.
__label__2	"Terrible customer care. I was first person into store to pickup new pre-ordered iPhone 11.  Told they could not setup because I did not have an iCloud backup of my IPhone 10.  Told go home and setup new phone yourself.  

Totally wrong. Apple via phone was able to have me transfer iPhone 10 data to iPhone 11. I was Told store should have done this as normal customer service.  I guess Apple Willow Grove staff find customers inconvenient.  There sure was an army of them just standing around doing nothing. 

Apple Willow Grove is the worst Apple store I have visited."
__label__2	I liked the old District 611. I have been here a handful of times since its reopening and i have to say each time we have come back the food is just okay.  Nothing that i would go out of my way for.
__label__2	Below average food and service. The tacos had no real flavor, soggy and falling apart.  The queso was like dipping chips in lukewarm milk, and the margaritas tasted like the mixer with no alcohol. Dirty glasses all over the bar, and a tacky crowd. The kind of atmosphere of a college hangout where quality is a afterthought.  Happy hour looks to be a good deal though.  I'll go back for that with friends if no one cares how the food and drink tastes.
__label__2	Waiting staff had a attitude couldn't get our drinks he was slow then begged for a good review
__label__2	Drink here, don't eat, everything is cured in 30lbs of salt. First time chicken has ever been salted more than a dry aged steak.
__label__2	The food here is pretty darn good but the people here just dont care at all. I went in and placed a large order, barely any interaction with the staff. They have guacamole out to serve yourself but they were out. I asked if they had any more, I was told a side would be 3 dollars. Even though its something they have out. Bad customer service.
__label__2	"Totally overrated.  What's the hype about this place?  I just don't get it.

The steak they use is nothing but cheap, and you can tell.  The cheese doesn't properly melt.  And those are the worst sauteed onions I've had in a long time.

Sad to say it, I think Steak Escape at the mall is tastier than this place.  And cheaper, too. 

2 stars because at least the fries were tasty."
__label__2	"I came in on 5-7-16 @ 5pm  I asked for a beer and water, never got my water.   I ordered a burger and fries to be cooked well , well done . The man broght my food and I said those fried  are not done enough..  the waitresses asked if everything was cooked fine  and I said no but I'll eat bcs I'm not waiting for it to be re cooked. 
I will never come back to this place! !  
Poor quality and not as made right the first time."
__label__2	"Lunch there last year. Food is very high priced and unusually small portions. I tiny fish sandwich with a sprig of a veg at an outrageous price. 

Obviously living on an undeserved reputation. Some people like to say they spent a lot of money on lunch or dinner. If you're one of those, by all means, go there."
__label__2	Well. The hour long wait was excessive but expected on a Saturday night. We get seated at a table that is basically just a long table for several people but sectioned off. So we basically ate dinner with strangers in earshot. Zero privacy. The food was mediocre at best and my steak was way over cooked and let's not talk about the prices  but I am giving them two stars because our server was sweet.
__label__2	"This afternoon, Wifey & I had lunch, I ordered Crab Wonton & Shrimp Lo Mein & wifey had Shrimp Pad Thai. two soda's...

My Lo Mein should had been Garlic Lo Mein.  I love garlic, But this was unbelievable...... I  had two 2-3 bites and gave up.  Wifey ate about 6-8 bites and gave up.. Very disappointing, We ate here before and it was good."
__label__2	The drop off was easy but once we returned, we waited over 20 minutes for a shuttle to arrive. Once we returned to the lot, our car was waiting, turned on and we were told to have a good night. Couldn't leave the lot though because not one employee mentioned that our payment hadn't been processed. No one told us this or came out to let us know. Just watched us through the window trying to figure out what to do now. I'm a customer service based person, so on customer service alone, I will not be using them again.
__label__2	Honestly I think this is one of the most over rated places going. Pizza is mediocre and the prices are a little steep. We've been a couple of times and like most chain restaurants it ends up being disappointing. Don't see myself returning.
__label__2	Rashawn was straight up rude! I was there with MY  boyfriend and she blatantly hit on him in front of me. The food and everything was amazing but she was the reason I would never return and recommend no one else does either. She treated me with zero respect and therefore, they lost my business
__label__2	Long wait for a table.  Then a long wait for the waiter/waitress.  Best item:  breadsticks.
__label__2	Food wasn't good at all, and after twenty minutes of eating my Chicken Lo Mein, I had a stomach ache. Not necessarily cheap, but not expensive.
__label__2	"Cheesesteak: great, good quality meat. They get your food to you quickly. 

The two star rating is for the cheese fries. Picture attached. I opened this and said, ""you've got to be shitting me."" There couldn't have been more than 20 fries in here. They were good, don't get me wrong, but that's just ridiculous to charge $4.50 plus tax for the fries."
__label__2	As the other posts have stated, the food is decent, if over-priced, and the staff isn't up to the task.  I couldn't log-in to their internet (I went to Black Crow Coffee to write this review), because their router wouldn't assign my Windows 8.1 an IP address.  I asked them to try to affect a solution by resetting their router.  The dumb bunnies behind the counter gave me an answer to the effect that, because there was music streaming live over the web, there was nothing wrong with the router.  Kids!
__label__2	We were excited to finally try this place and we each got the Hawaiian smoothie. They were both basically inedible because they were completely packed with pineapple skin (rind?). We had to spit out every single sip until we eventually trashed them. And no, I'm not talking about pulp. It was the tough, prickly pineapple skin. Clearly someone didn't slice the pineapple correctly before putting it in the blender. Absolutely disgusting.
__label__2	I've had better sushi at the Rouses next door....
__label__2	3 people here. I had to flag down the bartender every time i wanted a beer. Tacos are gross. I was hoping for a lot more.
__label__2	Never ever go to this Walmart after 8pm they usually only have 2 lanes open which run back to the aisles with products and a scan yourself which half of them do not work and when my box wasn't ringing up the guy standing there said you have to go to a register so that was another 20 minute wait at the back of the line again! I love walmarts prices and products but the employees that don't smile or say a word to you makes it hard to return to that store
__label__2	Toppings were stale and there was no fresh fruit offered in the designated bins. Also, some of the flavors did not work. Employee behind the counter was also very unhelpful. Would not recommend this froyo to a friend.
__label__2	Great selection of beer, but wayyyy overpriced. The live music is too loud to hear one another talk, so it's not a great place to chill and have a drink. Unless your thing is to over pay for drinks and leave with a hearing aid.
__label__2	"First, the guy that took my order was super nice and friendly, great customer service. 
But the food was not good. Lacking flavor, tasted like frozen Chinese. Over priced for what you receive. Will not be eating here again."
__label__2	Nice and professional, but exhorbitant prices. For example, to spay our dog they wanted $500+. We had it done by another very good area vet for $99.
__label__2	"Didn't expect a letdown from Zara's.  Ordered ham/roast beef/Swiss from the sandwich counter.
Upon opening it there was ham and roast beef only, and barely any at that.  I checked the receipt as I recalled paying like fourteen something for everything.  Yeah, $8.99 for a poboy with less meat than a chain shop..."
__label__2	For the second time, and this is a Monday night, over an hour to receive food.  Absolutely ridiculous.  It's not as if the food is that great, typical chain steak and fare.  The children's food came out, finished, and became agitated before our food hit the table.  Never again.
__label__2	Super salty sauces.  Meats are poor quality.  I like veggies and the ability to customize but the price point is too high.  My bowl came out overcooked and soggy.  I like the concept but I've seen much better execution at mom and pop places for this style of food.
__label__2	I heard a lot of great things about mellow mushroom so I decided to finally try it. Very disappointing. I went with my kids and we sat for 15-20 minutes before finally having to flag someone down to wait on me. When the pizza came out, the kids pizza was cooked too long and way too crispy.  My pizza was really good though. I was looking for a place that would be fast to eat at since I did have my kids but it was way too long of a lunch.
__label__2	Ok we stopped here on a Thursday the day the Bolts were playing in the playoffs. The service was horrible and the food was equally bad. Enough said try another spot close by!
__label__2	It was an alright choice for a team outing after a basketball game. Service was actually good but not perfect. The food however was pretty mediocre. We ordered double fries for 2 two sides and only received a single side. The taste was nothing to write about...pretty bland and the meat was very fatty. Fries were plain and disappointing. Was expecting a BBQ joint to at least put in work to deliver tasty fries. With all the other options on Oracle I'd say pick a different spot to enjoy yourself.
__label__2	"Ahhh bagels my comfort food!  Daughter took me here for breakfast on my birthday unfortunately we were disappointed.  

The best part of eating a bagel is the cream cheese that goes on top.  My mother used to say that she liked a little bagel with her cream cheese.  Well, that's certainly not the case here.  I have never had a bagel with so little cream cheese on it.  Spread thinner than butter and didn't even cover the bagel.  Prices are not cheap for these bagels and there is no excuse for such stinginess."
__label__2	Cutting a celery stick in four thin slices is cheap azz. Spicing the chicken up with sauce instead cooking it in spice is cheap azz.
__label__2	I ordered the small bowl and couldn't believe how much açaí was in my bowl. It was such a small layer and half my bowl was granola. Added on extra strawberries and counted 4 slices at the most. Taste was great but I wouldn't come back again.
__label__2	Don't go late... After 7:00pm all donuts are hard like a brick. Heat the donuts if you don't want to loose a teeth.
__label__2	First time having boston market in years...now I know why. Sides were all greasy and not that good. Chicken was mediocre and pricy. Wouldn't go here again.
__label__2	This was my favorite Wine and Spirits store until late in the week I went in only to discover the staff were not wearing masks, and they did not ask patron to wear them either. We are still under a mask mandate and the casual disregard is not a good business decision. I'll be shopping elsewhere.
__label__2	"UPDATE: the Monday PM manager is combative and rude.  Morning Call NEEDS to up-grade on customer service if they hope to build upon the ambiance of the City Park Location.

An AMAZING and historic addition to City Park, especially for the walking set.  Enjoy a plate of Bignets, then take your coffee to stroll through the K & B sculpture garden.

Great spot late at night, after prom or evening out."
__label__2	Not a great sandwich if you know anything about what a philly hoagie should taste like
__label__2	Eh, I could take it or leave it. Service was OK (not slow), food was OK. It was just OK. I looooved the patio though and it was very dog friendly. So maybe I could add another star on behalf of my baby-er-I mean dog.
__label__2	"I was there 2 Sundays ago and traveled down from Reading and as soon as I pulled into the back parking lot, a staff member told me that they were closed for a private party. I 
was bummed  because they could have kept the front part open as the party was in the back dining room. I checked it out as I thought I was being punked!"
__label__2	We wanted to be support local businesses with our remodel but we won't be using this one again.
__label__2	Service was five stars at this place but my kale caesar salad hardly had kale and was mostly romaine. There was also supposed to be brussel sprout shavings and there were none. The shrimp was cooked perfectly but was overly salty. Not to mention, they brought me the wrong salad to begin with. $16 for a romaine caesar? No thanks, I can get that at Panera! My husband had the Nashville chicken, which he liked. However, it was two pieces of chicken with a few pickles and sweet potato pancakes for $17. Overpriced all together.
__label__2	Interesting spin on most menu items, but not tasty enough for me to make a specific trip back. Fries were ho-hum and while the pickle bar and condiments were boutique, nothing wowed me
__label__2	Over priced hipster place that tourists love. The taco was a joke. A smidgen of meat and lots of lettuce or something green. The reveled eggs were good but the fried pork rind on top in NOT a cracklings. Go once. Take a picture and then go to Parkway or R&O's for really great sandwiches!
__label__2	I was expecting much more.  The place is a nice old building a bit tight the bartender was friendly which is the reason for the extra star.  I ordered the Roast Beef sandwich that was rather dry and seemed like it was just thick cut lunch meat that was served.  I don't think I will be back when there are so many other great places in the area.
__label__2	The service was great. But the food has changed.  The quality and flavor has diminished drastically from the past. There were 6 of us and we all agreed. I use to love going there,  but unless the food gets better,  we will be going elsewhere.  You could tell the food was not prepared with pride or love. Too bad. We could have gone anywhere we wanted,   but decided to give square one another chance.   It was just as inadequate as the last time. I doubt we will give it a third chance.
__label__2	Good food, but pretty bad service. My boyfriend and I came here for dinner one night, each ordered 3 rolls, and were there for an hour and a half.
__label__2	Hmmmm...I think this is the first time that I have pretty drastically disagreed with most other reviewers. I wasn't impressed with this place at all. For the price we paid we could have gone to Five Guys and gotten a much tastier burger and much better fries. Even the shakes were nothing special. Ordered guacamole to be on the burger for something different, but it was forgotten. They also seemed confused by their own numbering system and tried to bring us someone else's food multiple times. Definitely not going back.
__label__2	Website says that they are open Monday through Friday for walkins, no appointment needed. Supposedly, they open at 10 AM. I showed up at 10:40 after A 30 minute plus drive to find them closed. There is no sign saying when or if they will reopen. Nothing posted on the website or on their phone message. My advice would be to call before coming to make sure they are actually open. This was a complete waste of a morning.
__label__2	In desperate need of an update.  The ceiling leaks in the main weight room area when it rains.  The front desk staff is the worst.  Zero customer service from them at check in, your luck if they bother to look up from their cell phone to swipe your card.  Decent amount of weight equipment thought.
__label__2	We tried mocha and chai the 1st time we came here it was super good . the next time we ordered the somethings but there were different servers who made our order , it was disappointing
__label__2	If it wasn't for the nice driver who eventually picked me up and is really friendly, Barbara, this would've been a 1 star review. Still last time I use this dump as walking is better. The other drivers are all rude and racing and just nasty nasty people. When calling the help-line the person answering the phone states that I was wrong as I should stand at baggage claim 3, which doesn't exist.  The parking lot itself is okay, price is good but one gets what one pays for... so maybe you're lucky and get Barbara as driver
__label__2	bland, boring, not coming back! Certainly not a real sushi house little to no. fish, & no flavor! How do you consider yourself a sushi house when you don't put hardly any fish on the rolls (like a razor thin slice). I won't be going back like EVER!
__label__2	The Ale house has definitely seen better days.  The foods edible but nothing special.  I had a philly which is supposedly one of their signature dishes and was not impressed at all.  Stay away from their draft beer unless its Bud Light or Miller Light.  The tap system is definitely not cleaned regularly as I ordered a Sierra Nevada and it tasted more like Milwaukee's Best.  I suggest the Ale House for some light beer after work or a game but skip the food.
__label__2	This is hands down the worst Philly I have ever had. There was barely any meat, not enough cheese to taste, and enough grease to almost drown with each bite. To be fair though, the menu here has great variety. It's a shame a place with pretty decent bread has to have such downfalls in filling it up.
__label__2	Nice people, but it takes entirely too long to get out of this place with a car. Also a problem for cashless tolls, as Enterprise does not provide an EZPass. NY 9A requires EZPass or they mail a bill. Enterprise then charged me for the toll plus a $10 admin fee.
__label__2	Staff are friendly, the beignets are made fresh while you wait, so why only 2 stars? Mostly the lighting: ceiling fans in front of lights gives the entire place a strobe light feeling that is anything but relaxing. The constant TV volume doesn't help relax me either. If you can't sit outside, don't bother!
__label__2	Service was not very good and not impressed with the plates I've ate their twice just to be sure I didn't like it and yeah not missing out on anything on the menu and the plates aren't very big or filling the only thing I do like is their drinks at the bar but again I can get those made anywhere.
__label__2	Love the wings, love Haddonfield PJs, cherry hill needs some help! Bartenders do not know how to make drinks, three olives, red bull was so watered down that he took me to 267.00 to not feel buzzed. Won't be going back to Cherry Hill PJs again!
__label__2	Ehhh..... honestly it was a little boring. Zombie paintball wasn't worth it. You get 10 to 15 shots at a mounted gun at maybe 3 or 4 outposts. The maze was so-so. The hayride was cheesy.
__label__2	I came here with my son when he was 3 and had a terrible experience. For one, there were an overbearing amount of restrictions that sucked the fun out of the experience. The staff was not friendly or helpful. I would not go back.
__label__2	"The place was nice and clean and used the plastic basin covers for the pedicure station which i like. I think it depends who you get. The youngish female
Yesterday with  shoulder length hair tried to leave my toes with a tiny sloppy bit in the middle and didnt paint the whole nail. I asked her to fix it and it was a mess. Even my husband said they didnt look neat. Id say make an appt with someone you know is good, the woman's nails next to me looked great."
__label__2	"Waaaaay too over-hyped and expensive for what's on offer. Prices are on the order of LA vegan bakeries, without the taste or selection. The ""filled"" cakes do not consistently contain a good amount of filling. After tasting a dozen different varieties, I'm done. Not returning."
__label__2	i order some buffalo chick with celery sticks and the celery stick were not good they were bad and dirty! not to mention that the wing taste like they were frozen. i called for my order  to be correct and the store is still taking forever to come and im beginning to think that the order isnt even coming. very unsatisfied.
__label__2	"Not what it used to be. Menu seems stale and food wasn't as tasty as we recalled.  Maybe they lost their original chef and the new one can't keep up with the menu. 

Probably dropped off our must visit in SB list."
__label__2	Called up for two take out pizzas. (1st time) Not happy, For a Pizza I paid over $22.00 for, it was missing the taste.  I have ordered the Holy Shiitaki before when we ate at the Mushroom and it was awesome.  This one, was less then stellar.
__label__2	Apparently you can SMOKE on planes now. On my flight back to the US there were two men sitting in front of me and they were smoking AN E-cigarette or something of that sort. Although there were many other things wrong with that flight, this was the one thing that I could not be left unsaid . If you have a policy, then you should always fulfill that policy. I was just overall  disappointed with the airline. I think this is an issue that needs to be resolved quickly.
__label__2	Overrated. Ordered a dozen bagels to go and most of them were stale.  Sucks. I would have returned them  but not worth the hassle. Lost a customer.
__label__2	"Great service. 

But very disappointed with the food. I don't know what everyone is raving about or I don't know if we just picked a bad day. We were three of us for dinner and had the dinner buffet and none of us liked even a single dish. We had a bad stomach immediately after. Will not be going back"
__label__2	"Not my favorite, but good.  Service is incredibly slow- call ahead. Make sure you don't get screwed out of a decent sized piece of cake- many friends of mine have paid close to 6 bucks for tiny slices- their portions are inconsistent.

I like:

1) Chicken cheese steak- no peppers- soy cheese and extra veganaise with the pepper steak gravy on a spinach wrap
2) Mongolian Tofu wrap
3) Pistachio vegan ice cream
4) Cinnamon Buns
5) FRIED SHRIMP"
__label__2	This was my first trip to STL and I had high hopes for this place, but was disappointed of the lack of flavor of their ribs.  It was like there was no seasoning at all and I was just eating poor quality cooked meat. Some of the employees were rude when asking them about the menu and recommendations, which only made the experience worse.  Reading the other reviews, I may have caught them on an off day; but I won't be coming back due to my experience.
__label__2	"Plus factors: Interior appearance, friendly wait staff, nice tableware, great looking lounge area.

Minus factors: Seating to the left as you enter the dining area - every time the front door opened, there was an arctic blast; too long to get food to the table (25 minutes for a shrimp po' boy and fries); food not hot; food bland.

I will try again in a couple of weeks."
__label__2	Ordered Szechuan chicken: chicken was over-cooked, vegetables were under-cooked and had basically a entire bowl of undercooked veggies with minimal (over-cooked) chicken pieces. Just really really poor.
__label__2	Fantastic outdoor location! Fantastic staff, unless you care about grandma that is. Come here to get your drink and a quick dose of COVID-19. Why go anywhere else! Get the virus, I mean appetizers, while it's hot!
__label__2	"Huge place.  The carpet is old and smelly.
Bar foods.  This place got stuck in a time warp between an adult, or kids entertainment video Game Center.  
The video horse racing game is a joke.  It's an Asian race track, not American.  Where the horses running in reverse direction.  No one plays it, and taken up space."
__label__2	Cute items, but extremely overpriced. Reese seems to be a well-aware and empowering woman, and yet all of the products in this store are made overseas and the prices are very jacked up. I was disappointed to see this.
__label__2	Too noisy with all the Air polluting planes flying way too low in a Park Area. I feel bad for the people who live there. They used to fly father out over the river until the FAA and the Philadelphia Airport decided National Park was not worthy of a care.
__label__2	Okay-ish for Mexican food at the airport. Chips were subpar at best... the chicken fajitas weren't like you could get in Texas, but they were not dry and the chicken and flavor were decent. One thing that was different (not a bad different, just different-differwnt) is that the rice had corn in it. Something new I hadn't had before.
__label__2	The female stylist was on the phone talking and texting..  I called two days after because I could not see my highlights and they suggested a gloss treatment. Very poor experience and they did not seem to want to make it right. For the money I better notice that I had my hair cut and highlights put in!!! I really liked the lady that did my brows.  I will not be returning and it's unfortunate for them because I am a great tipper!!!
__label__2	I usually don't have big requirements for hotels, I am an anything goes kinda guy. But this hotel is an absolute ripoff. We were out all day until 3:30, and when we came back, the hallway smelled of stale food because they hadn't cleared the room service food from the night before. Additionally, our room had not been serviced, and we needed fresh towels to get ready for a wedding. Not professional for the price.
__label__2	Web says open until 1030, voice mail (called 3 times) says open until 1030.  Walk over at 10:07....no we're closed, summer hours, we just found out.
__label__2	We were able to get here when the market opened, so I'm sure we beat the crowds that would otherwise be attacking this place.  Even got seats for two!  We ordered the obligatory roast pork sandwich, and a sausage sandwich.  Personally, I don't see the hype of the roast pork.  It was juicy, but bland.  The sharp provolone overpowered everything and didn't go with the rest of the sandwich.  My favorite part was probably the broccoli rabe.  I definitely liked the sausage sandwich more, but it was a standard sausage on a roll.
__label__2	"Yet another STL chain store which treats customers at certain locations like garbage. Slow checkouts, bad produce, limited stock, grungy. How is it even legal for Schnucks treat the customers here like this, compared to customers at other Schnucks locations in south/west county. Is our money not as good as theirs?

The policeman here is nice, and seems to know some of the regular customers."
__label__2	They have great selections of Turkish food but it's very overpriced. The food is also over priced. The lamachun used to be good but I'm not sure what happened. Now it's paper thin and mostly burned and has affected my stomach a lot. I won't be going back.
__label__2	It might be a good place to hangout. Their beer was average to me and the food was very mediocre and a little overpriced. The staff were friendly.
__label__2	Terrible service. Bartender was more interested in flirting with women at the bar than serving.
__label__2	Cute place & friendly staff. End of positive right there. Prices aren't listed for donuts. 2 dozen yeast & a mocha latte was $54, and that was AFTER a 15% discount!! Not only was the latte not hot, it was not good AT ALL. The donuts were dry & bland, the glaze was crumbly & dry. I'm actually pissed about having spent that much money on such a low quality product.
__label__2	Heard so much about this place we had to try it.  It was ok.    I'm from Tucson and could see this as a place people from out of town would like. The service was good but the food was bland. No heat at all.  The beans had very little flavor.  I eat all over Tucson and different places have their own version. But I just can't recommend this place
__label__2	Being in the Fry's Signature Shopping Center....walk-in's are welcome! Need a fast pedi, this is the place for you. Brow wax, mani or a set of nails.....ditto. It is close and accessible. Business prefers tip in cash verses adding in credit card transaction. Depends on who you get to do your pedicure and how much attention to detail they provide.
__label__2	The burger itself is just okay, but my sesame bun lacked the substance to carry the sandwich. It simply fell apart and wandered all over the plate and me with every bite, and it had this worse than Wonder Bread consistency. I came here on a gift card. Hey it's free, but I would go to Five Guys instead, just down the street from the mall. More burger for your buck without the nonsense of a hostess, seating, anticipation, and Angus let down.
__label__2	"Rude employee that got annoyed when asked what could be put on the cheesesteak (first time here) and rushed the ordering process when it wasn't even busy in there. Front area is very small and cannot even comfortably fit three people waiting on their orders. 
This cheesecake tasted exactly like, if not more underwhelming than, one I could get at home in Upstate NY, so nothing special. Ended up buying taco bell sauce at a store to give it some flavor. We don't understand what the hype was about for this place. 
Will not be back."
__label__2	Food is wonderful, but the service could improve. My gf had to pick up an emergency phone call. Not having a chance to even talk, one of the employee there rudely interrupted her and stated that we had to answer our call in the lobby. I've been to some of the most fancy restaurants and they don't even require this. Due to this bad experience, we were not able to truly enjoy the food. Tip: As long as your customer is not loud and interrupting other people, leave your customer alone. They are there for the experience, not policed.
__label__2	Me and my husband had food poisoning here, the truck was outside cigar city and we have both been vomitting all night.
__label__2	"Had bad experience!
Got to Tampa from NY for few days and went to Whole Foods Market to get some lunch. Unfortunately, food in salad and hot bar looks really bad and far from fresh, same with other ready to eat and cooked food. Anyway, I decided to try.. I wish I will just leave after looking at it. It taste horrible.. Piece of salmon was like wood and guacamole had nothing close to fresh avocado. I would not recommend to eat cooked food there."
__label__2	"My review for their bagels are skewed and bias: I moved to Nashville from Brooklyn 2 weeks ago.

The cream cheese was thick and flavorless. The bagel was chewy and barely toasted. Wouldn't go again."
__label__2	Small lounge in the center of Silver Legacy with waitress service. Cool little spot to take a break from gambling or to pregame for the night!!
__label__2	I waited at the order speaker for almost 5 minutes before I was even greeted. Sat out the window for 5 minutes to pay without being greeted. No apology for the wait although he did thank me for coming in. This is not up to the standards that I am used to from Los betos
__label__2	Overpriced.  My sweet potato was sad--it was about the size of a boiled egg (true story).  Our server (Josh) was exceptional, and he is the reason this isn't a one star.  Unfortunately, his excellent service couldn't mask the inadequacy of the food quality to price ratio. If your looking for good service - yes, but if your looking for great food - no.
__label__2	This place used to be good food quality went down drastically.. Workers playing on their phones in dining area in front of customers.. Much better Vietnamese restaurants within the area.. Good reviews of this place from people that haven't had better is an obvious reason for their rating.. Gave it a chance, not coming back
__label__2	It's kind of a regular Chinese take-out place - big on quantity, small on quality. Sugary-but-bland sauces douse the fried, flabby bits of meat and vegetables. The rice has probably been sitting under a heat lamp for hours - maybe since yesterday. The denizens of downtown Wilmington seem to like it, and they stop in to feed on reasonably priced victuals...it's kind of like the fast-food of Asian cookery.
__label__2	Food way over priced and not that good.  My shrimp dish was loaded with onions and bell pepper and the shrimp we just average.  The mushu chicken only had flavor if covered in plum sauce.  Rarely eat Chinese but I usually love it.  I will not be back here.
__label__2	I ordered the Salsiccia pizza. I really wanted to love it, but the crust was soggy. :( (and I ate it in the restaurant). Maybe it's just me, but I like a pizza crust that can handle its toppings.
__label__2	I went in with several shirts, dresses, and pants for dry cleaning. They were prompt and helpful with respect to taking my order and returning my clothes on time,  but one of my pants came back very discolored and unfortunately is no longer usable. Otherwise a good experience...but I wouldn't risk going back, unfortunately.
__label__2	I've come here many times in the past 6 months for psuedo healthy alternatives since my daughter started UCSB, but today I should have saved my money. It wasn't even busy and the cashier took my order down wrong. I asked them to fix it, the manager came to assist and they still brought it out wrong three times after I paid the difference for the mistake -And ultimately the order was still wrong and the flavors completely off as the Ahi Tuna was mushy and greasy. Do what you want, but I won't be back.
__label__2	I go here every Sunday with my family, not by choice really. I have a different opinion and think the prices are a little high, for the rather average quality of food. This is obviously a South County staple. I can't say I would choose it on my own, without my family. I'd say C+ at best. Try IHOP.
__label__2	Big improvement from Annette's!!! Def a local pub. Good selection of beers and ppl all friendly. Entering the bar through the maze of smokers huddled out front is bit of a turn off n trashy. Was shocked not to see any female bartenders. Guys were all cool. They paid Little more attention paid to regulars. Food is nothing special typical bar food. Bartender twice gave us wrong . The smoking and mistakes by bartender resulted in 2 stars. Could be 3 maybe 4. Will give another shot
__label__2	Was hoping to get a nice glass of wine here, but no luck. Limited wine list. Service is very slow, so don't go if you are in a hurry to catch a flight. I ordered the cheesy chips and salsa as a mid day snack and it was mainly chip crumbs with a little bit of melted cheese, a bed of lettuce with about 4 tablespoons of guacamole and a small cup of salsa out of a jar. The server was very pleasant- just a bit slow.
__label__2	This place is hit or miss and more miss than hit. Undercooked pizza most of the time. Its like they get busy and just pull it out too early.  Nice people..  and there really isn't much better anywhere :)
__label__2	Ordered a cheesesteak and mozarella sticks and 2 drinks at 6:19pm. I live only 12 minutes away from the restaurant. It is now 8:08pm and still no food. I have called them 3 times and each time she said she is gonna call the driver then the phone hangs up. Terrible service. I am giving a two in hopes of my food arriving at some point
__label__2	I checked out Tuk Tuk Real because of a recommendation by my boss and a friend. Unfortunately, I wasn't thrilled by the food at this place. Honestly the food seemed like it was for people who don't season their food or like bland food. I had a quesadilla and a chicken tamale. They were just ok. Other than that the service was good and it was a BYOB. I don't think I'd come back but maybe to try the wings and lamb nachos which I heard were a hit.
__label__2	Don't understand what the hypes about. Came here once. Steak wasn't seasoned or chopped. Was dry. Came with a bunch of friends. We were all like...  1. Jim's 2. Chubby's 3. Amato's up in Fairless Hills. They're killing Steve's. Oh & don't get the chocolate soda. I know it sounds like a good idea.
__label__2	I read some of the reviews for this location prior to visiting and I thought it might be a little sketchy.  We arrived at about 9 last FRI night and there wasnt really anyone there.  It seems like a perfectly normal dive gay bar.  My bf ordered a dirty martini and I had a beer.  Both were priced fairly ($4.50 and $7) and we hopped to the next bar.  Nothing to write home about but fun.
__label__2	Great sandwiches!! The service @ the counter stinks! 2 girls gabbing about what's went on last week..like I care. No biggie! Just get my order right! When I drive over the bridge & pay a $5 dollar toll & a $14 parking fee just & $3.25 tip!! I expect to get a simple order correct! Thanks for nothing GABBY GIRLS!!!
__label__2	We were very excited to try this restaurant but ended up being very disappointed. The sauce served with the calamari was not good at all. It was almost like donair sauce. The alfredo was absolutely flavourless and the noodles were too thick. The only positive thing about the meal was the bread. Overall very sad and will not be back.
__label__2	It's fine, but the beef doesnt have as good flavor and texture compared to Seoul Taco down the road. The cook treats you like crap too. On the upside you save a buck compared to Seoul.
__label__2	Way over priced.  Measuring contents for a $12 margarita is crazy/embarrassing.
__label__2	Went to noble crust with high expectations however the service was below par. The speed of service was very slow. My boyfriends meatball lunch came with one lousy meatball. When asked about it, the waitress had no answer and didn't try to please the guests. Will not go back. Overrated.
__label__2	"I read the reviews ... but still decided to make a go of it.  I ordered the bifteki sandwich and instead got the platter.  The beef was way over cooked, the Athens' fries were dry and tasteless.  The grape leaves weren't very good at all.

Food was ok.
Service was slow.
and
It was not worth what we paid.

Sorry that it wasn't better.  I don't think we will be back!"
__label__2	"""Meh"" seems to some up this place. Been there 3 times and have bought 3 different items. While the bagels seem fresh the bagels sandwiches aren't very good....especially for ~$6."
__label__2	pizza's average.. not the worst but definitely not the best. somehow, they always charge me a different price whenever i go in for a couple slices. i always order the same two slices (because i'm constrained to only two different types there since i'm a vegetarian) but they literally charge me different totals every single time.. i guess the managers like to spontaneously change up their prices depending on their moods...?
__label__2	"We are locals and have been here previously but the menu has changed and not for the better.  Increased prices and decreased quality!! Fish and chips for $14.99 with two little pieces of fried fish... Caesar salads that were not good...birds bathing in the little pond in the middle of the restaurant and spraying nasty water everywhere and flying over your food on top of spending $90 and eating with plastic silverware.... We frequent johns pass but will not be eating again at ""The Hut"""
__label__2	Extremely rude, I will never bother to visit again. The young woman at the fro t desk needs to learn some manners.
__label__2	My son has to have specific shoes and kinda only like this place, or I would NEVER shop here. Very hard to get anyone's attention. I spent $125.00 on my Nikes and $225.00 on his shoes. They ring I all up and coral you in a fence and barely a thank you from anyone. Just a sad loud place for kids to go and spend mommy and daddies hard earned bucks.
__label__2	We should have read the reviews, but we learned the hard way this is not a good place to stay. The room was not particularly clean and they are using covid as an excuse not to provide breakfast although they are still advertising it.
__label__2	Worst ever. I used to love this place. I had misorderes and charges for food sent to me incorrectly that I was allergic to but yet charged for. Never got return calls from management. I PREFER JERSEY MIKE'S. They listen, they don't home deliver yet but do deliver on their products!
__label__2	Tanya was wonderful. Mary was rude, dismissive, offensive and condescending.
__label__2	The Melting Pot provides a nice, unique meal, but it is not worth the high prices... my visit this past weekend was a once and done.
__label__2	Ridiculous outrageous prices.  $14 fir a friggin philly cheese sub.  $2.49 fir a 20 oz soda.  Never going there again RIPOFF. GREEDY SCUMBAGS
__label__2	Food was pretty good, pico de gallo very fresh but the place is a total wreck. No clean tables, filthy floors with food all over them, and the ladies bathroom trash bin was overflowing with sanitary products. Glad I ate before I went in there, would have been a total appetite suppressant.
__label__2	"Great outdoor sitting area! We were able to meet and chat with travelers while sitting and relaxing there. The bar itself has a cool vibe to it. 

However, the bartender seemed slightly standoffish. I could be wrong though, sometimes people come off a certain way. Who knows. I didn't think the drink was very good, nor worth the cost though. It was however, a very pretty purple color! 

I think it just comes down to personal preference here. I didn't enjoy it as much, but maybe others will like it. It does have good reviews!"
__label__2	Been here many times. Not the same as the ones at home in BC. Tonight must of been an off night. Over an hour to get our food, which was just 2 burgers. A table beside us came in 30 minutes after we did and received their food 2 minutes after us. Waitress seemed a bit frazzled. Refills were slow. Generally when I go here service and food are much better.
__label__2	Really expensive, even for airport food. Very small portions. Slow service. Also outside security, which made it a pain to get to. Bottom line -- this place clearly exists to rip off tourists.
__label__2	Ordered wings and Philly cheesesteak. Their pizza is usually good but the wings and Philly cheesesteak were  not good at all. Wings were bland and not crispy and seems like it was parboiled and the cheesesteak was a disappointment
__label__2	This is in a convenient location, to where I can stop by while out and about for other things.  Much like some of its neighboring businesses, it is understaffed and damn near impossible to get an employee to help you on the floor.  After walking around the store three full times without finding an employee, I got in the register line to ask a question, just to get misdirected, then have to wait all over again in the register line in order to pay.
__label__2	First time here to try the all-u-can-eat sushi. It was ok but I am very upset that they don't have tempura   Or inari! This is Japanese sushi bar and yet no tempura !! WHF !!  No mochi! Not coming back anymore!!!! Not satisfied, but Great service
__label__2	Ugh, so wanted to like this place. We ordered the humus plate to start. It was basic humus, and a few skimpy veggies. Also ordered a thin crust spinachini to split. A few uncooked tomatoes, raw spinach, and whole pieces of garlic, but zero flavor. Once our server took our order we never saw her again until after we requested our check from someone else. I have no idea what all of the fuss is about. We left there wishing we had stopped by Costco for a slice of pizza.
__label__2	Food was way over priced I liked the food but I'll never in my life will pay that much for a taco again that was crazy. $50 was just too much for 4 tacos 2 drinks and I'm not an ass so I left a tip, hopefully they change their prices soon. Good food though.
__label__2	For me Fogo de Chao was a disappointment.  After having experienced Texas de Brazil in Orlando, Palm Beach, Chicago, Pittsburgh and New York Fogo simply is not up to it.  The service was just ok and the food was very bland.  Fogo appeared to be understaffed and the staff simply did not seem to care.  We were two couple and between food, drinks and desert we left over $400.00.  After our meal discussing the experience the drinks were the highlight.  Again Texas de Brazil is less expensive and in every one we have eaten at we have never been disappointed.
__label__2	We were so excited for this, but you definitely pay for the spectacle of eating on an old boat. Food prices were high for how small the portions were, let alone quality not amazing in taste. All in all, not worth it. If we're paying $50 a steak, I want to be full and satisfied. We were far from it.
__label__2	Good food, OK wine list, horrid service; will give one more try...
__label__2	I've eaten there twice, I won't go back. My experience both times was bland food and poor service. Friendly though. But nothing terrible happened. Except we watched a young couple walk in, sit down (sign said Seat Yourself), 20 minutes later nobody had waited on them so they left. I predict they won't be in business long - in a few years you can ridicule me if they are.
__label__2	It's smoky like a maternity ward and juicy like NPR.  If you add enough hot sauce, the sweetness of the house sauce is tamed enough to tackle.
__label__2	Love Ross but this Ross would be way better if they employees that work there would be nicer and more courteous. Most of them rarely smile or acknowledge you. Also the lines are almost always very long there unless you go right when they open. On the plus side...this is one of the cleaner Rosses...
__label__2	This location used to be great but now it seems like their chicken is gotten to such a tiny size the service is extremely slow food comes out cold shakes melted and this is been my past five visits here now are used to go there all the Tom I will never visit this location anymore they have hired new employees and these employees do not care
__label__2	After we sent our first pitcher of margaritas back for being sickeningly sweet and lacking tequila, the second pitcher wasn't much better.  The food was average, at best.  They need to take a lesson from El Vez or El Rey in CC.  Will not be going back.
__label__2	Even among CBs, this one is distinguished for its poor service and worse food. Tonight they ran out of turkey and dressing -- the only good entree they serve. I also was given a dirty fork. There is no manager in sight and it shows.  Nobody who works here cares a damn.
__label__2	So I wanted something a little light so I ordered a cherry cider. the sign stated the price as $6 for a pint but I wanted a half pint. Got my half pint and was charged $6. I asked about it and was told the sign was wrong and the cider should be $6/half pint. $6 for 8 oz seems like a lot which I mentioned. Seems like they could have done the gracious thing and not charged me the full price.
__label__2	The food is WAY overrated!!! Mediocre at best. I've eaten my share of Mediterranean cuisine & this place ranks quite low on the quality, presentation & flavor Greek food should have. Our server, Peggy was a DOLL!!! Literally she made the meal for me! Mostly for her recommendation for the baklava cheesecake! It was AMAZING!!! Literally perfect! So- don't fall for the Tarpon Spring tourist trap...but do have the baklava cheesecake.
__label__2	By far the worst quick serve Mexican around.  I really don't know how these franchises stay in business.  The rice is disgusting and when thats your base for a burrito there is a huge problem.  They don't mix everything up, so you get one bite with chicken another bite of just sour cream and so on, whats the point?
__label__2	Meh! I came here based on the 4 star review and was really disappointed by the quality of the sushi. The fish was not very fresh and I couldn't even swallow it. If you like high quality sushi, this is not the place to go.
__label__2	If your not a smoker DO NOT go. When you leave everything you are wearing will smell like nasty cigarette smoke. I'm sure this place is great for some but I don't like dirty, smoky, greasy restaurants.
__label__2	"We were in Philly for the weekend.  Stopped by Pats for a Cheesesteak.  Believe me when I tell you, ""Any New Jersey diner can make a better Cheesesteak Sandwich than Pats"".  Nothing to write home about.  Cheese Wiz, what the hell are they thinking ?????"
__label__2	"The good: The rooftop bar is great! On a nice breezy day you would think you're at  the shore. 

The bad: The food is horrible. I'm talking Kmart Cafeteria horrible. It was the only time in my life I refused to pay for the food I ate. I've never even asked for a reduction in the food price but it was so bad I told the waitress I'm not paying. She didn't charge me."
__label__2	Zzzzzz.... longest wait.... Zzzzzz.... it's like that Sloth working in the DMV in that one cartoon!
__label__2	They have the worst turkey burgers in the business,, it's a processed patty that is so hard and the taste is foul ,, the steak and fried chicken players are ok but do not order a turkey burger , just skip that part of the menu
__label__2	We stopped in on our way back to Los Alamos after the long holiday weekend and were not bowled over by the experience. The service was terrible. Both the wait staff and sushi guys were slow. We were through our second roll when my husband finally got his sake. The sushi guys were distracted by a customer at the sushi bar who was distracting them with her chit chat. The food was interesting though and high quality.
__label__2	As loyal, long time, casapulla north patrons it pains me to write this review. We made an order in June and there was much less meat and cheese on the subs. We chalked it up to a fluke.  We ordered again yesterday and the same thing... At least a third less cheese ( if not half) on the cheese sub and the Dave's Club Sub had little ham. Maybe time to look for a new sub shop.
__label__2	Not really sure what all the buzz is about this place. Yeah it's divey, but EXTREMELY out dated. It's one of those places that reaks of stale air kind of like grandmas where nothin he been changed or moved for 40 years. Let alone cleaned! And that includes the shag carpet rug fronted bar.  It's disgusting and loves to cover u in dust and must.  And the beers we had were warm. Probably won't be back here.
__label__2	"If its not life or death and you can get to another hospital, please go somewhere else. Virtua ER used to be thorough and top notch. Now they check you in, charge you, maybe take your vitals and send you home.
And the nurses station is more like a loud Starbucks lobby. Phones out, online shopping, Instagram, laughing way too loud for the area they work in; totally not dialed in to anything that's going on around them. Sad."
__label__2	"Mediocre at best. 2 star restaurant. This restaurant is basically another branch of ""Red Lobster"". Wished we went there instead. Atleast their bread is amazing. This restaurants' bread was terrible! My entree (sea bass oscar) looked like it was thrown on the plate. No effort was put into plating at all. And there was zero flavor?! The steak was cooked well. But not well enough for us to return whenever we do visit Nashville once again."
__label__2	"So we walked in at exactly 9:30 pm and was greeted with ""Hi, the kitchen closes in 30 mins so, order fast!"" Don't know who trained these greeters but they failed. I gave two stars because at the very least she said it with a smile and not an attitude. Anyway, go to the one on Prince Rd. Service is far superior."
__label__2	We had cosmis back in October 2020 and it was delicious. We've been raving to my family about how good it was so for our tailgate for the Phillies game we picked up cheesesteaks and they absolutely sucked. The rolls were old and there was no cheese in the sandwiches. I'm so embarrassed to have said this was one of the better cheesesteaks in Philly. Very disappointed
__label__2	The salad has been disappointing, all the lettuce is hard chunks or kind of brown, more white pieces than green used and quite dry, never enough dressing. The pasta with red sauce is just average in flavor.
__label__2	I'm kind of disappointed in this place. I got a tri-tip burrito and there was definitely rice but I'm not sure where the tri-tip went...to top it off I got stale chips  so $8.50 I got a rice and a little tri-tip burrito
__label__2	"My wife and I had a Hotdog each and i had one beer  and she had a lemonade..it was over 22 dollars... and it wasnt very good.
great location to people watch, but thats about it..be prepared for the roar of bikes parking or pulling out if you intend to sit along the sidewalk..
im sure its a happening place in the evening., but be prepared to spend big dollars .
i will try another place next time..we did eat earlier at the Peddlers Pub in the village 10 minutes away...i prefered  that place"
__label__2	Had the pork chop. It didn't live up to the hype. Our party had two orders of the pork chop and both were ordered medium both came out well done. The pork chop lacked flavor and the sides were to salty.  For the price it should have been much better. I will say the appetizer was on super yummy and the only good thing I have to say about the meal.
__label__2	"Slow and weird service

The starter would come before we were served water.  Restaurant was half full at most and we waited at least 45 mins to get our main course.  

Food was ok and overpriced. The cauliflower was warm at most.  Both of us ended up hungry afterwards

Restaurant is also prioritizing delivery order over in-dining guests.  Would not be back."
__label__2	After many years, finally went there to try out the food and see what all the fuss was about.  Location and the amount of publicity that they generate is five stars.  The food is barely two stars.  Since the food is supposed to be home cooked, I thought that it would taste like the food that my friends from Thailand made.  Truly disappointing. Go for the ambiance, but if you want good food avoid at all cost.  Also, just expensive for the quality.
__label__2	"Excitedly went with my family because of the rumor that Robert Irvine was there overhauling it.. The best thing about the place besides the decor was the waitress who was wonderful and friendly.. The wine and beer prices and selections were great.. The salad was great. The bruschetta was soaked in olive oil.. couldn't eat it. The mussels were well flavored but over cooked.. My husband's veal piccata was over cooked. The cheesecake was wonderful. 
I'd go back there for the bar, the salad and the cheesecake only."
__label__2	Terrible experience. Never helped me when they saw me struggle with a package. Didn't help me with anything at all in fact. When shipping; they never offered options or disclosed how much shipping would be. Added insurance to my box that I didn't want and selected expedited shipping g that I didn't want. People seemed miserable to be there.
__label__2	"Went in for a gel manicure. Waited kind of a long time. They're pretty slow. It's not that they were busy...just slow. They are all very nice but it's honestly the worst gel manicure I've ever had. Also, the most expensive.

Oh and Dr. Phil was on the whole time and a woman was talking about being raped by her father. Really brought the place down and made it pretty uncomfortable. Literally any other show would have been more appropriate."
__label__2	O-ver-ra-ted... OK, they have good cornbread muffins and fruit tea, but that's about it. I never understood the popularity, but I guess it's just not my cup of tea...
__label__2	Dude King of Thai in sf is better than this place. Portion very small  and food is average to below. Food looked and tasted like someone was attempting home cooking. Yelpers led me to wrong place.
__label__2	Garish, not actually high quality food or ingredient, over priced too. Sauce is too sour for oyster, and overall seafood doesn't look fresh or taste fresh.
__label__2	So the food is ok nothing great. Customer service is seriously lacking.  When I commented I had ordered extra cheese and would like it I got flak.  Some guy appearing as a manager gave me lip when I said they were stingy. Also I did not order lettuce or sour cream which were on my food pointed that out and got more flak.  As a destination I wouldn't go far for this place
__label__2	"Ordered $60 of food, pizza was delivered cold with tough crust; ordered chopped salad with no onions, salad came heaping with onions, it was like they put extra onions in the salad! Ordered seafood pasta, came with only two shrimp and sprinkle of crab meat. Shrimp are cheap!
Called them to complain and they were like too busy to be bothered saying they don't offer refunds only credits on future orders"
__label__2	Food brought in for two people at extremely far apart times, my child's meal was brought in after 30 minutes from mine. I thought the food was overated.
__label__2	"Americanized Mediterranean food. Terrible value. Bland flavors that literally seemed reduced to salt and pepper. 

They recommended I get the steak platter ($12.95 = $14 with tax); what an awful value for 5 small cubes of steak. Steak was relatively tender, however seemed overcooked with no charring or rich grilled flavor. 

This place might be better for just grabbing a drink late at night. Perhaps their sandwiches are better?"
__label__2	Cozy quarters in a great location. Beer tender was friendly. We had beer and wine drinkers in our group and no one was satisfied with their product. Doubt we will try it again.
__label__2	Horrible service. They did not take order well. Shish kabob rubbery and overcooked. Humus was too garlicky. Salad was full of water. Only grilled chicken was good.
__label__2	"First time I went, ordered a fajita bowl with grilled chicken. It was decent enough to give it another shot. I called in the order, ""fajita bowl, with grilled chicken"". Picked it up, drove home and wouldn't you know it, no grilled chicken. It really shouldn't be difficult to mess a one item order up, too many other options to go back here after that."
__label__2	We have a men's group every Tuesday morning. Our waiter Rene is the best. The food is satisfactory a d priced well and they offer military discounts. The problem is that trying to pay a d leave sometimes takes 15 minutes. It is an extremely slow process. Why can't they let the waiters take our payment?
__label__2	"The service was fast, prompt and safe! However, the food isn't desirable. The hash brown was cold, my croissant with sausage and gravy was bland. 

I should have ordered waffles or pancakes... for sure something else. Would I give this restaurant another visit- NO"
__label__2	I've been a few times now, and each time I ask why did I go back.. Seems like serving size while OK, doesn't match the price tag they charge for their menu items. I think I am done giving this place a try as my wallet prefers I go elsewhere.
__label__2	Sad space unfortunately. It is well designed interior but that's where the charm ends. Baked goods are very dry. Pandemic raging and all the patrons and staff walking around with no masks. Yikes. Ignoramuses. Latte was poor. Ice so small I am drinking a slushie, not an iced coffee but an ice slushie. Sorry coco. Not good.
__label__2	NOT GRANOLA ON THE ACAI BOWL! Someone wrote about that in the Yelp reviews so I called to see if that changed and they confirmed it was granola and not oats. It was oats...  chewy and the addition of almond milk gave it a runny texture. Very disappointed, the mango was gross too. Like it was only hours away from total spoilage. I'm giving it a 2 star because the Cobb I also got that day salvaged them a bit.
__label__2	2 stars because on a very consistent basis I go into the restroom and it is a disaster: water everywhere, empty TP rolls next to garbage, no TP or seat covers, dirt and grime all over the floor, out of soap. I understand that this is a high-volume Starbucks and a lot of traffic comes from sandy beach-goers, but management should compensate for this by increasing frequency of bathroom checks/cleanings. It seems like a pretty simple problem with an even simpler solution, yet it remains an issue.
__label__2	"Its alright if you like to get down with the pre-packaged sushi. I wish it was made fresh right in front of me, but then it wouldn't be a fast food sushi joint. 

I don't find them particularly cheap, but in that neighborhood you're going to pay 10 bucks minimum no matter what the food is. I feel bad about the amount of wast that goes into the packaging. 

I'd eat here again. I can only give it 2 stars because really... its just meh."
__label__2	Just stopped in to give this place a try. GF got the veggie bowl with the falafel and I got the bowl with steak. I have to say this was more like a bowl of salt with sides of other things. The bowl is way to salty. I'm not a health freak but this has got to be extremely bad for you. Almost inedible only plus is the fries were ok.
__label__2	We were really hoping with the remodel that the service would improve too.  Not the case.  The service is so slow and the wait staff seem more interested in talking to one another then waiting on tables. If you have young children and aren't in a hurry the place is fine.  Otherwise go somewhere else.
__label__2	"Jets Pizza in Fishhawk has a sign that offers half of wings on Wednesday with the purchase of any large, 8 corner, NY, or XL pizza. Tried to order the wings and was told you can only have the wings half price if you order any of the items with only one topping. No where does it say it has to be only one topping. Sign is/was very missing leading. Especially, since the sign says ""any""."
__label__2	Just a question: why would you open your kitchen at 7am, when your doors open at 6:30? Been sitting in your establishment for 25 mins, waiting for eggs, sausage, potatoes and a biscuit.
__label__2	"I don't get it.  I just don't get it.  Burger is nothing more than I could cook at home in a frying pan.  And I really do like a greasy burger, but one with some flavor.  Kinda of reminded me of a Wendy's burger.  Beer was served in a little bitty glass (kinda like the ones you get in Amsterdam - the three gulp kind).  Kinda pricey for what you get.  

All these reviews of 4 and 5 stars.  I just don't get it."
__label__2	Went for lunch today and was less than impressed. Burrito was mostly rice with a few large chunks of breaded flavorless chicken. That and a coke ran me close to $12 - certainly not worth it.
__label__2	Last time I went it was fine. Went to pick up same order lamb and chicken shish, not good. Dry, the hummus barely covered the bottom of the styrofoam and nothing but some meat and rice no onions or anything so couldn't make my usual wrap
__label__2	Maybe we went on an extremely busy time. Couple of the menu items were out. The cauliflower tacos were ridiculously overpriced. Overall the menu was overpriced. If I had known the town better I would not have eaten there I would've gone somewhere else
__label__2	Food is good the only issues were the roaches that crawled onto the table. We told the staff they said we know about them.........okay so I won't be back for a long time if any at all
__label__2	The property is nice, the customer service is terrible. No one is on the same page and the employees are always late. I've had a broken washer for a week and I keep getting the runaround. Someone was supposed to come and clean for my new lease that's beginning tomorrow... No one showed up. Again, love the property and location...not the customer service or how they treat the tenants.
__label__2	We went for brunch, and I don't think any of us will be back.  We enjoyed the decor, cappuccinos, and disco fries.  Other than that, it fell flat.  We really wanted to like this place.  The egg dishes were overcooked with little flavor and the avocado toast (which was on a roll) was unappetizing.  Colleagues went the week before and got disco fries and burgers which were good.  I hope it improves.
__label__2	Rough! Wow the service is getting worse! I literally just stood here for 5 minutes  watching three employees have a non work related conversation as my food sat in the window! I had to interrupt their chat to get my food. No sorry either! Sorry to interrupt your conversation ladies
__label__2	Sorry, I have been here many times because my kids like it, but the reference to In and Out burgers is misplaced. I have never craved a burger shack burger, but if I am within 100 miles of an In-N-Out Burger I will drive there! The fries are nothing to crave either, certainly not anywhere near as good as 5 Guys or in and out burger. In all actuality, the burger and fries are better at Martin's across the street.
__label__2	"If you are looking for products other than produce and meat, you can probably find mostly anything here. Produce tends to be subpar and the meat selection is not great.

Use this store to buy things on the fly, wouldn't recommend shopping here for all groceries."
__label__2	Had red beans they were horrible an the pork chop was not at pork chop . Someone had the meatball if was so spicy we took away from a child . The food was not the usual.
__label__2	It's fine. The people aren't really that friendly that work here, but it's clean enough to stop by because of the new Coke machine they have with all the flavors. I definitely like Chipotle over Moe's because of the meat. Something about the flavoring of the chicken here isn't my favorite. I don't know why I can't really express why I don't love it, but I just always view it as the bottom choice for drop in Mexicali fair.
__label__2	don't even get me STARTED! i was so excited for 2 days about this place and we went and i got the roasted vegetable quinoa bowl which was a huge mistake. i swear to god it was just steamed pieces of broccoli, cauliflower, and sweet potato. there was no seasoning whatsoever and the quinoa was barely present. everyone else's food was fine to below average. cute coffee mugs tho
__label__2	The service is bad, the food is decent. My first time here - the kids behind the counter are goofing off, my server is unattentive, borderline rude, and just overall blase, very unhelpful. It's nice to have another option for lunch around here but it's not blowing my mind.
__label__2	Huge menu with high prices. Two $16 burgers and 3 beers later cost $70. Crappy beer selection, but there were middling european imports on draught, nothing local or hopped to speak off. Was expecting a focus on local beer. They do have an extensive hard ice-tea menu. The stripper outfits are cute in a weird pervy Catholic schoolgirl way. It was the first place we tried after arriving in Edmonton, so maybe this is just the Albertan way? I guess you need to work in the oil patch to feel like throwing around a lot of money here is worth it.
__label__2	menu was average.  food was less than average.  avocado used on my dish was just not ripe. basic fries and salad, average pub type food.  yes it smelled like a brewery.
__label__2	We went on Friday, July 5th after finding out NOLA stopped taking people at 10 pm.  I have heard of this place in passing. Needless to say the food was okay but the service was terrible.  We sat at the bar and the bartender was a bit rude.  If it were not for the fact I was tired of walking to get something to eat I would have left.  My shrimp appetizer was over priced and the skimped on the shrimp.  Thanks but no thanks. Never again.
__label__2	Food is mediocre, service is worse. Rudest conversation I have ever had when ordering take out!
__label__2	Food was underwhelming and service is incredibly slow. We have gone her a couple of times this year and the service is always awful. We are done with this place.
__label__2	Sorry to say the new owner And workers are not living up to the previous owner.  My gel nails would last at least 2 weeks, on Sunday I had my nails done. By Tuesday, my nails started to peel, down to only four nails with polish still on. On top of the polish coming off so quickly, they cut the quicks on four of my nails as they were buffing. I tried to call the owner, I'm out of town, but she was not available.  I'm sure they will get their act together but I can't waste my time or money until they do.
__label__2	"The plus side? They are very fast. 

The downside? Every time I've gone to this place, I've requested a small iced coffee, extra cream, extra sugar, yet I *always* got a small iced coffee with milk and some type of sugar substitute. Even when I specifically asked for half and half, not milk, and sugar, no sugar substitutes, I still ended up with some type of sugar substitute. Gross."
__label__2	If it was consistent it would get 5 stars.  Not all theaters have reclining seats.  Since you can reserve seats in all theaters you don't always realize it until your there.  The price is also the same - I'm looking forward for when they fully update all their theaters.
__label__2	Everyone was nice but as a former Starbucks employee and manager I was disappointed at the wait time. There was only one employee making drinks and he wasn't multi tasking or calling ahead. Maybe it was an off day
__label__2	Small post office with minimum supplies. Close to my house but the lines are long with only one employee behind the counter. It would help if they had a self service kiosk.
__label__2	Ok. I get it. Overpriced hotel means everything else in the hotel needs to be as well. But $90 for a mani/pedi??? So you would think for that price it would be the most relaxing mani/pedi of your life, right? Nope. Instead of being able to just zone out one is expected to entertain the staff, listen to their problems, and be their assistant. Honestly, save yourself $90 and just pack your own bottle of nail polish.
__label__2	Overpriced, greasy food, overstated flavors, and service that will ignore you entirely. Will not return.
__label__2	This Denny's always messes up orders. The service is slow. The place is not clean and the bathrooms stink.
__label__2	I am so disappointed because the website looks so inviting.  When you purchase a voucher that states you are buying a 1 Hour Hot Stone Massage, a foot scrub, mud mask & warm neck rub - you expect to get a 60 minutes massage and then all the other stuff. That's what is advertised.   Well, you don't.  You get all that in 60 minutes, cutting your massage time down to, at best, 45 minutes.  I don't know about you, but 45 minutes is never enough of a massage.  They should deliver what they advertise they are selling you.
__label__2	Stopped by on Thursday 03/29. Bartender was more interested in her friends than her customers. Could not find her to order a second glass of wine..... she was sitting with her friends. Finally had to raise my empty glass to get her attention. No type of apology for the lack of customer service. Ordered onion ring app. Again, had to track down my waitress (the bartender) for ketchup. Won't be back.
__label__2	"I wouldn't say the buffet was amazing. It was just okay. They have different types of dishes, sushi and seafood but I wasn't satisfied. For over 20 bucks I could have gotten something else that would be more satisfying. If you go crazy over the clams and seafood maybe that would be worth it.

The mixed drinks from the bar was good though and our server was pretty nice and funny."
__label__2	Went here for dinner for the first time on Easter Sunday. The food was subpar at best. Got a pizza and it came out cold. The restaurant itself dirty and dimly lit. The service was ok. The busser named cole did a very good job and was very helpful.
__label__2	Yeah...wally wally getting bigger and its 24 hrs now
__label__2	When i was younger pats used to be my favorite place to get a cheesesteak .. Nowadays their cheesesteaks are just not as great..  Theyre definetly better than Geno's ill tell you that much.
__label__2	"Ugh! Really great food in a cool space ruined by really bad, really rushed service.

It's a shame because you can tell how badly they want you to vacate the table from the second you sit down. There's no excuse for treating customers like they're an inconvenience.

I'm sure they'll continue to be hugely successful, but they've lost sight of the point."
__label__2	Don't bother with checking in online. It's a waste of time, you'll still wait and possibly longer than quoted. The hostess with the horrendous eyebrows needs to take a class in customer service.
__label__2	Where to start. I guess they have the ability to make eggs and potatoes but that is it. If you go to a highly rated breakfast joint and order a Benedict why would you get mashed potatoes biscuits and raw pasta? Don't go not worth it. If you want normal diner food go across the street to the nugget.
__label__2	"It feels to me like people at the Ritz Carlton are upset that they were bought by Marriott and  retaliating against platinum and titanium members by giving horrible service.

The service at this hotel is a joke. But the room was decent actually quite nice. There were many problems but here's just one example: I called room service and asked for two wine glasses - two hours later they never showed up.  I had to walk to the bar to get them.

I think there was a mistake in training and they mistook the word hospitality for hostility.

Just a terrible terrible service hotel. The room was great though."
__label__2	"5 years ago this place was much busier and better winning awards and the like. Now the place was a ghost town at 7pm on a Friday night and we wondered why.   They didn't have what I originally wanted, 12 year olds are answering the phone and the place is dingy.  Not my idea of ideal and the fact I am thinking about it the next day shows how bad an impression it left.

Our dinner was ok, nothing to write home about , we probably won't be going back. They need a Gordon Ramsey Kitchen Nightmare revival to get us back in there."
__label__2	Beware of the partially uncooked burgers and seafood. Your stomach will thank you later!
__label__2	The web site shows a good selection of children shoes starting at sizes for 1 year olds. Whent to the store and didn't carry any sizes less than 5.
__label__2	"Went to the shop. I'll have the #6 basic sub with provolone cheese. ""So you want the #1 ham and swiss,"" replied the guy behind the counter. ""No the #6 with provolone cheese,"" I replied. ""Oh, the #1 main sub,"" he replied. Whatever!. Too complicated to order a cheese sandwich on a bun!"
__label__2	We went with a group of 6, on Sat. 6/30; we were expecting great food. We went in with high expectations and were disappointed. My husband's and friend's ribeye came out with bad cuts of meat, fatty, thin and the fat wasn't rendered, it looked unappetizing. My other friend's filet looked like a hockey puck. The steaks only came with a side of potato and had to pay extra for a salad.  This is one place that we won't go back.
__label__2	"Just ok.  I really like Korean BBQ, but Giwa leaves a lot to be desired.  If it's lunch time, you can go to Miga for a few dollars less (which you won't be able to believe once you've eaten there).  I'd also say BBGo has better bulgogi.

I haven't had the tacos, and I'll give them a shot one of these days."
__label__2	Used to be a great location. Now I go there and the employees are having personal conversations so loud using inappropriate language that my son asks me what are they talking about. Don't expect the online app stock to match in store stock. I look online to check stock and rush over and it's never in stock or employees can't find it. Besides the shoe and toy department it's usually pretty neat.
__label__2	"I would only go here out of necessity for certain korean foods you cannot pickup at any other grocery store. Otherwise, I would advise you to get produce and meats and anything else fresh at Wegman's down the street. For example, I needed some shishito peppers and carefully looked at all of the packages - all had mold inside them. 

Also, check the ""Best By:"" and ""Sell By:"" dates on anything and everything in the store. I saw items with Sell By dates dating back to 2017 in their cooking sauce aisle."
__label__2	Not worth it. Got a pedicure and felt they rushed me through and did a terrible job. Not worth $32.
__label__2	Wow it's sad to read all the negative or low reviews but last time I was there was 2014. Use to be an excellent restaurant with very good food and service. Wonder if they sold as happens to Phoenix wok. To bad it was an excellent place
__label__2	This restaurant doesn't come close to Vietnamese restaurants in Sacramento. The food here is sub-par, but the service is okay. I would only come here if I absolutely needed to have pho as my hang over cure.
__label__2	if you're shopping it's not too bad but if you're selling it is the worst experience ever. So much of the items hanging in their store are super worn, old, torn, etc but when I came in with items I haven't even worn to sell they said the items are used and the employees were the most obnoxious and rude people ever; at willow grove and landsdale. Used to go there all the time but after frequent experiences like that, will not recommend anyone to go there anymore.
__label__2	The food would have been good... Had it come warm. It didn't. It took forever to get drinks and we definitely saw the bottom of bottomless mimosas.
__label__2	Very Dissapointed with dinner. Restaurant with great presentation and ambience, but not impressed by flavor of food and dishes. Arancini's were soggy, the riggatoni tasted like a plate that can be cooked easily at home and the Sea Bass was not de boned completely and did not have any flavor at all plus overpriced for what it was. Old Fashioned cocktail way to over priced for the Bourbon Whiskey used for it. It looks management was more worried about packing the restaurant than the quality of the service.
__label__2	This is the second time I've ordered from here. Last time, my partner and I both agreed that the meal was very bland, which is rare for him because he doesn't handle spicy very well. Today, I ordered some paneer makhani as a comfort food, I had a crazy dental procedure. Anyway, the curry sauce was very watery and the spice level wasn't accurate. (I ordered medium it was more of a mild). I'd love to try this place again, maybe third time is the charm?
__label__2	"I've been here on a few different occasions and the best word I can think to describe the food here is ""meh"".  The food is just ok.  No more, no less.  When compared with the price they charge, it certainly isn't worth the money in my opinion.  The last time I was here I ordered spare ribs with some blue cheese scalloped potatoes.  The ribs were average at best, and the potatoes were raw.  This seems like a place where I would rather just grab a drink at the bar as opposed to order dinner.  Go for drinks, not for food."
__label__2	"Not to be nostalgic, but HH was better before it had a website and credit-card machine. I can taste smoke in the meat, but it's faint and acrid, as if the goods were smoked over pine or some other softwood. The sauces were thin and weak, and the cornbread was soggy. 

Still, this place offers a good value, and you can't beat the scenery."
__label__2	Food average.  Pasta overcooked.  My husband liked his chicken florentine.  The service was extremely slow.  The manager apologized and took some money off our check.
__label__2	"Mediocre sushi, sashimi and rolls. The sashimi was still defrosting when it was served and the shrimp tempura was disgusting.

Avoid like Covid."
__label__2	Has a lot of potential, I just cannot allow myself to pay the bar prices that this place charges. Ya, great selection and all, but I can drive ten minutes down the road and find a comparable selection 30-40-almost 50% cheaper. I want local business to thrive and all, but I don't want to feel like a snook either. Prolly won't be back, unless dire short term party emergency scenario dictates, but I am a good enough planner to not have to step foot in there again.
__label__2	Very slow. I ordered delivery from here and the estimate said 40 minutes. It ended up taking 1h40m. It wasn't the delivery driver's fault either. Once he left the restaurant it took him less than 5 minutes to get here. The food was cold but tasted fine.
__label__2	"Not a fan of their breakfast. Their chorizo burrito with red sauce was bland. The only good thing about this burrito was the fresh pico de gallo they put on top. 
Our service was horrific too. 
Their hotel is great but I'd rather go to waffle house down the street then come here for breakfast again.
I've heard great things about their dinners on the other hand."
__label__2	"This is a salon disguised as a barbershop.  If you're looking for an actual barbershop, you're not going to find it here.  

I request a simple haircut - medium fade, 1 1/2 guard and blend the side and top.  That haircut happens thousands of times in barbershops  across the country.  It did not happen at Roosters so I can't give them anything higher than a 2.

On the plus, the beauticians are friendly.  I do recommend an appointment as they seem steady in clients."
__label__2	Ordered a burrito today which had no rice in it, as described on the menu. Just a tortilla filled with meat, beans and a little lettuce & tomato. Bummer!!!
__label__2	"We were very disappointed with the Americana Taphouse!  When it was the boathouse, we went frequently and it was solid good food.
There was really nothing on the menu to write home about... very average food."
__label__2	The customer service is not what it should be here. People are rude and I feel like I'm inconveniencing them. Rushing me through my order
__label__2	This Mexican restaurant did not meet my expectations and did not have good food. While the service was adequate, the food did not do justice. The salsa had a very sour flavor, and the chips did not seem fresh, but rather the generic variety from a grocery store. When I received my food, the beans were lacking flavor, and it was messy overall. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone in Troy, IL, and one would be better off at Taco Bell.
__label__2	I ordered a breakfast burrito for takeout, and was really underwhelmed by two main problems: (1) the bottom of the tortilla was completely soggy from either the filling or the pico de gallo that was on the side and not in its own container and (2) the inside was about 50% potato and not nearly enough bacon. The sautéed peppers and onions inside, and the side of pico de gallo, were tasty though.
__label__2	What's good: The single-minded focus on burgers and fries (this is not a vast and varied menu, which is good). The selection of toppings for the burgers.What's bad: The price (a small burger, small fry and small drink will set you back close to 10 bucks). The limp, greasy fries.
__label__2	"We had a private room booked for about 20 people as we have done successfully for several years. All 20 of us arrived; they had our reservation but no rooms to offer ""due to a mistake""; tried to crowd us into a room with 2 other large noisey private parties in progress where everyone would have been exceptionally crowded.  The front desk guy asked me if ""we were all over 21""---our group is all in their 70's.
Huge disappointment, as we have enjoyed George's in prior years. We left and scrambled to find another place."
__label__2	The reason for my negative review is that these guys claim to open at 6am. I stopped by today at 6:05am and the lights were off and the door was still locked. Online it says that they open at 6am, but the sign of their door says 5:30am. This has happened to me multiple times at this location as I live around the corner. If you do not want to be open at 6, then please change your posted hours.
__label__2	Ordered two meals on line, one for me and one for my husband. Both meals were unfortunately missing ounces of meat in both and then saturated in sour cream. We felt like we were eating sour cream soup. We weren't even upset the on line order wasn't ready for pick up...Both meals were so poor tasting I'm turned off from chipotle for a long time.
__label__2	"I got an email with an offer for a 1 topping pizza for 5.50. I placed the order online and never received and confirmation from the website. I had to call the store to figure out fi the order had gone through.

I picked up the pizza. Thin crust still is cardboard like and the sauce has a bitter taste to it. The sausage is ok and reasonably distributed on the pizza. 

That said while it was cheap I am not sure I am going to rush back any time soon."
__label__2	"Showed up with a couple of minutes until they opened and they waved me off...uhm ok.

Went back a few hours later just to check out the selection of stuff people pawned when they had to have their gambling fix. Really kind of poor selection of stuff and they are pretty pricey on everything.

I'd pass based on service and prices."
__label__2	Great service. But wasnt worth the hype. Small portions. Food took forever. And our food was cold...Expensive for no reason.
__label__2	They apparently allow smoking on the patio, which is the coolest part.  This could be one of the best day pool patios/night club patios around... but I guess they'd rather make sure the .5% of their revenue are comfortable at the expense of the other 99.5%.  The real tragedy is the lost potential.
__label__2	Food looked really good, but made me feel absolutely gross. Also, it was all way too salty and heavily breaded. Eating was also messy. Not a fan.
__label__2	This HMart is very old and not too clean. The selections are not as good as Assi. I was particularly taken back by the rude cashiers. They don't even acknowledge you unless you speak Korean! Don't need this type of service at all. Will probably stick with Assi in north wales if I need anything Asian groceries.
__label__2	"Pros:
+ right downtown
+ nice lobby
+ rooms are nice. Not awesome, nice.

Cons:
- $16 a night for parking.
- No free anything, except coffee.
- there is a newer tower and an older tower. Guess where you'll stay if you booked through a budget booking website...
- you can drive pretty much anywhere and park for free in the city, we found. No need to stay downtown.

St Louis is laid out in a way that doesn't really encourage visitors to stay downtown, so save your money and don't."
__label__2	So, kind of disappointed.  Thought with an overall four star rating it would be decent.  My husband and I went for the lunch buffet.  The salad was fine.  The pizza was mediocre at best.  Pretty tasteless, quite honestly.  The beer was really a disappointment.  I had the amber, my husband had the chocolate porter.  Pretty thin and not much flavor.  I think the waiter was new.  Took quite a while to get two beers.  Overall, not impressed and won't be back.
__label__2	Was disappointed with my experience at Chop Steakhouse & Bar! Was out for dinner with my wife and the customer service was something to be desired! The waiter was non existent and we had other people attend our table. We were supposed to get bread and I had to ask for it. That being said, the food was ok. Not as good as the Keg but it was good none the less. We will not be back!!!
__label__2	I've been here 3 times and each time the pizza tasted completely different even though we ordered the same thing. I don't frequent places that aren't consistent so I won't be going back.
__label__2	"Normally love this place, BUT came into here today 8/10 and was the worst service ever. Waited at table for 15 minutes... no service, asked someone to help TWICE and they said they had to ""find our server"" when he dis come was inattentive didn't introduce himself."
__label__2	Rude bartender. The place was empty on a Friday evening and felt generally very unwelcoming. And their beer selection was pretty much limited to big names....I can't speak to the drag show though. I'm sure the girls are great. I wouldn't waste your time otherwise.
__label__2	"It's a trap! It's just a bar with mediocre sushi! 

The name says it all; they're not talking about the food, they're talking about you, you foolish, clueless American! Run away!

Seriously: go to Wasabi Downtown or Yoshi's in Chesterfield instead."
__label__2	Yelp notified me about this place.  Won't return.  Sat near window on a cold night and I was freezing.  Because we were near the door, anyone coming in and waiting (place is very small) gathered behind us.  Ordered the combo vermicelli with chicken, shrimp and spring roll.  The chicken was cold, the shrimp was warm-ish.  I prefer them hot.  My Vietnamese coffee was tiny for $4.00.  The 3 Vietnamese restaurants we frequent in Bryn Mawr, Havertown and Springfield are much better.
__label__2	Subpar. We ordered California roll, spicy tuna and chicken pad see ew. The spicy tuna roll had a hair in it. EW! So definitely the first turn off. The chicken pad sew ew was not that great either. It was very eggy and dry. We also bought a Thai ice tea which could almost make anyone go into a diabetic coma!! So if you buy that please be careful!! For subpar food we should have to pay almost $40.
__label__2	Nice atmosphere. Old school cool. The menu is lacking. I took offense of the Biden/Harris pics given today's political environment. I won't be coming back.
__label__2	I can understand the appeal, and when you're ready to tear into some oysters...you don't need atmosphere.  However, when you sit in the back area of this place...it's like sitting in a 70s mall food court.  Service seemed subpar the night I was here.
__label__2	"2 stars. Because of the staff. I was greeted with an ""oh great"" eye roll when I walked in at 8:15 on a Friday. They were complaining because the phone was ringing while taking my order. They dumped the tea early without asking if anyone would like a refill. Better watch it Firehouse, you're getting as crappy as your competition and your prices are $3-$5 more expensive."
__label__2	A amazing beach front setting, varied menu, full bar, with indoor and outdoor seating.... but super crowded beach access parking lot full of $75K+ cars, beautiful rich patrons with plastic surgery, perfectly coifed hair in boutique clothing, and then there is the food quality, well I noticed that there weren't any seagulls looking for food...  2 stars for the ambiance
__label__2	"Wait staff is fantastic.  Just wish they had been supported by good food and drink selections.  They were completely out of red wine and oysters.  Shrimp creole was just ok, nothing special.  The place was completely empty of customers at 6p on a Wednesday night.  Possibly going out of business?
I would recommend that you keep looking."
__label__2	Came with my family to eat dinner. We order The Gumbo which was just ok.. the fried green tomatoes were the best thing served, still I've had better. The shrimp scampi was terrible had just one bite because it was so under seasoned and bland. My mother had the oyster po boy and she said it was the same bland and too much batter. Out of our party of 6 no one liked their food. I was really looking forward to trying this place after reading the reviews but it just didn't live up to its hype.
__label__2	Yikes! Not sure what kind of Indian you Philly folks are comparing to, but this was not good... 4 stars for the nan. 1-2 stars for everything else, especially at the high dinner prices.
__label__2	it's always empty here, and a bit older, but good for happy hour drinks - there is a dance floor upstairs and they have an asian night once a month there
__label__2	Overly greasy.  Did not taste fresh.  We tried 7 or 8 different flavors and nothing was remarkable or stood out.  Neat idea but not good enough to go back.
__label__2	"Today is October 24th. Anyone wanting ribs, brisket, and pulled pork potatoe skins it's not available. Pizza sucks. It's packed. Don't waste your time with $5.50 bottles. Hour and a half wait for food.
  They need to expand there kitchen and smokers and cooks. Get rid of the pool tables and put in more bathrooms.  They expanded for more people to come, but not to cook for.
   Have the same stuff from before they put out there deck. How can you accommodate 100 more people with the same shit!!!!"
__label__2	I love the west philly location. Both times I ordered from Ardmore, parts of salad ingredients were over or under cooked. Hard sweet potatoes. The pesto vinaigrette dressing wasn't shaken and was pure oil so tasted like nothing and ruined salad. Will not go back to Ardmore location. Too bad.
__label__2	The food was trying too hard to be something it wasn't. We had the tasting menu on New Year's Eve and everything was below average. I left feeling hungry and annoyed by the lack of knowledge that the waitress had for the menu. Definitely won't be going back, there are way better places to eat in Edmonton.
__label__2	"We waited over an hour for 2 milkshakes and they were not good. They were half melted and very small for $13. Do not waste your time here. Stick to music and booze in Nashville and skip the expensive shakes.
This place is all hype/advertising."
__label__2	I ordered 2 chick fil-a sandwich 2 fries. I got 1 grilled chicken  (rubber ) 4 nuggets  2 fries and mac cheese..couldn't be any different from my order. If someone got my order I hope it was better!!!!
__label__2	There are few quality restaurants near airports. This placevused to have a wonderful, varied menu and there was something for everyone. It is now quite hostile to vegetarians.
__label__2	Went in for dinner on a Thursday evening about 2 weeks after this location opened. About 8 employees on duty, not very busy, we ordered 7 sandwiches to take with us, when we got home, several of the sandwiches were wrong, I would rather drive to the location at Bloomingdale & Bell Shoals for better service even though this one is 5 minutes from my house.
__label__2	Reviews at http://chowhound.chow.com/topics/971522 are all worth reading.
__label__2	"mobile ordering wait time average is anywhere from 25 mins to 40 mins, definitely the longest by far in the tampa bay area. traffic flow is horrid through the parking lot and in the drive thru.

customer service is not a problem. they serve with respect and no attitude ever. though the staff could add ""pep to their step"" aka walk with purpose and look like they are trying to reduce the crowd.

in regards to food quality and order correctness, not a problem at all."
__label__2	The place is nice. But the girl with short hair serving does not have good customer service. Once a price is given it should be honored.  They guy that was helping me first was very nice and once she took over forget it. She has no respect for her coworker. If she had something to say to him she should have pulled him aside and made sure no one was listening. I wouldn't want someone like her working for me. Poor guy didn't even look my way after.
__label__2	Buffet on Sunday was just ok.  Salad bar selections terrible (but by the looks of the people there, they don't look like salad eaters).  Boyfriend liked the Fried Chicken....for me, it was ok.  Chocolate cake dry dry dry.  I think my favorite thing was the frozen ice-cream bar.
__label__2	We only had the char grilled oysters, so I can't speak for the rest of the food.  The food was good not great.  The main reason for the two stars is I used the restroom prior to eating and it was filthy not just filthy disgusting.  Once I visited the restroom I certainly did not want to eat there.  The restaurant overall seems kind of dirty.  The oysters are the same price everywhere and delivered from the same vendor, so I'm not really sure why this place is so busy.  We were told the other location further out is much nicer.
__label__2	"Bar tender was rude (some tiny girl that looks like she hates her life)  about checking our ids. Both of us well over 21, then we were showing affection (my lady and me) and she told is to keep it pg-13... its a bar.. not a church. Felt really clicky and full of locals.. full of ""bros"""
__label__2	I purchased the original and the cookies and cream, cookies and cream was great as far as flavor both of them were freezer burnt. Expected delivery time phenomenal. Just need to improve the quality of the product.
__label__2	The renovations are beautiful and I was excited when I heard it opened but c'mon...It's 2021 and there is not one single vegetarian sandwich option? Hope they add one someday so I can actually have dinner there. Until then it's no bueno.
__label__2	After trying another Hawaiin BBQ place in town I realized this was much closer to me. I ordered the meat plate, which was very much ok. The meat which although thinly sliced was stuck into a big ball of meat which you had to pull apart. So the inside pieces were not marinated at all and unevenly cooked. The bbq saice they use for the meats did not seem to taste like any other Hawaiin BBQ I had before. Friendly staff, unfortunately the food was not the best.
__label__2	"Very trendy and obnoxious. It screams yuppie hipster.
I was not impressed with the menu or all the frill. The portions were small compared to the cost. Though the food was decent, I was disappointed in the selection. There wasn't much to choose from. This place puts more effort into being ""unique"" than into quality of service.  It was my friend's birthday and they brought her a light candle on a dessert plate...It was odd.  Its not a place I'll go to in the future."
__label__2	I went for brunch today with my friend. We had the chicken and waffles and deviled eggs. They used thigh meat for the chicken and I just found it gross. The deviled eggs were not good. My blood mary was bad. She was not happy with her Mimosa. I was embarrassed I took my friend here for brunch .
__label__2	Did a good job on repairing the car, However when I open the trunk I found 2 dead MICE inside...Sick the MICE were not there before,,
__label__2	"Bland, very Americanized Mexican food. No trace of any traditional Mexican spices. Zero heat.
1. Who ever heard of a Mexican restaurant without carnitas? 
2. The sopes were swimming in a copious amount of rather tasteless watery liquid which had overflowed the shell and onto the plate which removed their crispness. Did not resemble sopes very closely.

If this is 4.5 stars, I shudder at the thought of what is perceived as a bad Mexican restaurant in Santa Barbara

The two stars are because they let us have the dog under the table on the patio."
__label__2	The chicken is good but the spices are up and down. I always order mild and sometimes it's hotter than it should be. So that is a minus for me. Secondly....the sides...eww for this to be a chicken establishment, those sides are disgusting. The sides I tried were spaghetti, and mac and cheese. Taste like hot water. I will pass. So from now on I eat only the chicken.
__label__2	Cheese fries were awesome. The cheesesteak was flavorless. One word SEASONING. It had absolutely none. The crack head with a knife was the final straw. We inhaled the last of our food and jumped in the car as quickly as we could. Definitely do not get the hypeZ
__label__2	I really Wanted to like Nook - good concept, hip, downtown location. But I was disappointed.  The wait for a table, drinks and food was long. Food was bland and although chef doesn't add salt and pepper there are other flavors, spices. The table wasn't bussed and food was delivered wrong. Lost opportunity to wow us. Waiter seemed inexperienced and 20% service fee on table of 6 was higher than we felt was earned.
__label__2	"This place is completely overrated. Food was terrible, I dont know how anyone could call it Caribbean cuisine, it was bland and dry. The dance floor is overcrowded, drinks are too expensive.  I'd rather go to a ""hole in the wall"" salsa club in the ghetto than be have to deal with the frat-club/ bacholorette party  types that come through here, dont know how to dance, and then ruin your night by dumping drinks all over the place"
__label__2	Slow as molasses! They need to have more people working at lunch time when the line is full.
__label__2	Two stars is appropriate for this location. SUPER slow, to the point that cars were driving off without making it to the window. Girl at the window got salty when I asked for extra hot sauce and wasn't friendly. My order was wrong also and the soft tacos were cold to the touch. Their dining room is currently closed so not sure why they are so slow. Keep driving if you are in a hurry or value good service.
__label__2	Theater was crowded. Too many kids. Some were playing and doing flips. Ticket taker was very rude. My hands were full with food that I purchased there. She ordered me to put everything down. She refused to take the phone that I handed her with my mobile tickets. She yelled at me when I didn't scan it correctly. Then she directed me in the wrong direction for the auditorium. I paid more than $13 to be treated like a second class citizen.
__label__2	Great atmosphere and friendly staff, but food just wasn't good. The steak was burnt, and I ordered it medium. It also took almost 40 minutes to get our food. Finally, the bread they serve is very dry and crumbly.
__label__2	Mediocre service and disappointing food. Had shrimp, oysters and cheese fries. The fries come with grouper cheeks- except it definitely was NOT grouper and for the price- it SHOULD have been. Will not return here.
__label__2	This place  has a great ambiance,  and they really push the people through by the hundreds ,  I was amazed at how many people where seated while we where there , I really liked the atmosphere  the food was marginal at best though,  but the prices where pretty good  and the service was very good   so if you asked me if i would go back  ?   Well I guess so  if thats where everyone else wanted to go   but it wouldn't be my first choice by no means .
__label__2	The food was so so and quite expensive. flavor-wise, it is not the most authentic Mexican restaurant in town. It's good for a casual date or drinks with friends more than a real culinary experience
__label__2	Nothing special! Not worth the price. Tip the dj? He played a couple songs I would hear on KSHE. Our cocktails were quite delicious but you can get a good cocktail anywhere. Staff not really friendly.
__label__2	I wanted to love it here so much.  Heard great things from locals and the reviews were awesome.  Unfortunately, we had a margherita pizza that had absolutely no flavor.  I will admit, it was definitely fresh- I watched them make it and everything. It was like raw tomatoes on fire roasted crust with cheese that had no flavor.  Everyone in there was super nice, so service is 5 stars, but the pizza was a big two thumbs down.
__label__2	There's room for improvement. Sharp provolone with long hots on the pork and beef sandwiches were good but aren't anything special. They overcharge for toppings here $1.25 each. I don't mind spending money for good food but for these prices, I'd drive to philly for a more authentic sandwich joint.
__label__2	I used to go to Harry's in the 70's and it was a lot of fun. Not so much now. The martinis are strong but pricey if you order top shelf vodka. The Tee Off and Joe's have the same drinks for a reasonable price and the bartenders are much more personable. I went to Harry's last week and ordered wings and a martini and my bill was $28 before the tip. There are way better options in town with much better food.
__label__2	C'mon Ruth's Chris. I grew up with y'all. If Ms. Ruth was around she would never allow a fine Cabernet poured from a beer spout and changing an amazing bread puddin recipe! why would you do that??? Ruth's Chris is a top steakhouse! Don't cut corners!
__label__2	I like Giwa much better which is on 1608 Sansom st. My boyfriend and I got the korean wings and they were nothing compared to Cafe SoHo.
__label__2	I just do not understand the concept of waiting even more than 15 minutes to eat breakfast/brunch, let alone standing in line for an hour-3 hours. In 30 minutes alone I could go to Kroger, buy a box of Aunt Jemima and milk, and make my own pancakes.  Perfect example of hype and marketing being a useful business tool but honestly unless you're a tourist or go to Vandy, I do not get it.
__label__2	My mortgage was sold to these guys and after never missing a payment, I was dinged a penalty late fee during the transition. They put up a hard fight over several calls to acknowledge that they would try and refund the penalty. No mint integration. Dislike the company. Hard to get someone on the phone.
__label__2	"While the flavors were amazing and the service was quick, my Chicken Spinach Artichoke crepe was missing the spinach and artichokes!
My husband's Baja Omelet was delish and prepared well, it did not come with the red chili sauce the menu offered.

It would have been an overall great experience if we had gotten what the menu offered."
__label__2	Used to have really great brunch, but has gone way downhill. The employees could care less about service, the food takes forever, and the quality is gone. Such a bummer, used to love this place.
__label__2	I mean, I love Taco Bell. I guess what you get determines the location that you go to. I live 5 minutes or less, depending on traffic, away from this joint. I'm very disappointed. My crunch wrap supreme was COLD. I said COLD; not luke warm, COLD! It feels as if it were just sitting in a cooler. I thought these things were made on site, when ordered. He did make our drinks when we pulled up to the window. I guess that was nice? lol Hmmm, thank God for my neat little microwave gadget.
__label__2	"For tourists reading this: sure, why not. You're not going to find anything cheaper in the neighborhood and at least it's got a combo of Philly/borderline historical feel while also being very clean and inviting.

For everyone else: no way. SOOO expensive. Food quality is pretty good but just go to an actual restaurant for those prices. ."
__label__2	I like this Costco location but It's always too crowded and I can never find close parking.  Also keep in mind that visa is the only major credit card they accept, yes, they don't take MasterCard.
__label__2	If you like your wings nice and soggy, this is your place. I've tried a lot of different sauces and rubs, all are pretty mediocre. Not worth the price.
__label__2	"The biergarten is nice however the food wasn't. Most was dry and even burnt.

The only worth it was the snapper soup. Not good german coming from a german-american person. it lacked and I am afraid they were hoping that the people were too drunk to know what german food should taste like or perhaps they have never had good german food."
__label__2	"Well Friday was cannoli day. Such good timing I thought, since my son was moving over the weekend. I bought enough to feed all his helpers and I didn't have to make a dessert. My husband and I snuck 2 out of the box on Friday afternoon. What a disappointment! Skimpy filling, soggy shells, obviously not fresh! 
By Saturday afternoon, when all the moving was complete, I was embarrassed to serve them. They weren't even 24 hours from purchasing and they were horrible. 

This is our first bad experience here. Their tomato pie is DELISH!"
__label__2	"Went there for lunch, based on the reviews.  And, we both tried the buffet, again based on the reviews.  Some of the food was Ok, but some was very much ""mediocre buffet quality"".  The egg rolls were so-so (a bit soggy); the green veggies (bok choy and broccoli) were also ""Ok""...not crisp enough.  Veggie Egg Foo Yong was pretty good.  So was the pork dish.  The General Tso looked bad (over breaded, etc), and I never tried it."
__label__2	Very long wait and super small steaks compared to anything in the city. The ribeye looked to be frozen as well. They use Liscio's rolls and they are an awesome roll for the steak, but overall, it was really tiny for $11. Seasoned fries are very tasty if you have a chance to grab some! Also if you're into spice make sure you try their house hot peppers. Staff were wearing masks periodically.
__label__2	Overpriced overhyped wannabe Whole Foods. Save your time and money and go elsewhere. The Renauds in store is nice. Top notch bakery with quality pastries . The hot food section is solid but way overpriced. Other then some fancy sections here and there this just feels like a regular grocery store that try's to mask its self as a Whole Foods. Not sure what all of the hype is about, just an average store for n my eyes.
__label__2	Unprofessional.  Waited over an hour and a half.  Sat in the exam room and listened to the staff and Nurse Practitioner have personal conversations and then discuss my son's test results/other personal details in the common area outside the exam rooms.  Would not recommend this facility.
__label__2	Food was ok not worth the wait the bloody Mary on the other hand was worth going to get and walk to another establishment
__label__2	"Totally overrated. Loud, the food was just ""meh"" and seriously, the absolute worst martini I've ever had. How a bartender could screw a martini up that bad is mind blowing."
__label__2	Ordered the margarita pizza thin crust burnt crust, crunchy basil on top. Poor excuse for a margarita pie. was almost in edible. Had a better pie from a hole in the wall in Angier NC for 7 bucks less. What a huge disappointment.
__label__2	I just came at 530- coin machines broke employee says she may not have enough. I am washing 1 mattress pad for v525. Not super! clean mopping water in way is black. Not what i expected after reviews. My old one in less desirable area ran circles around this. Absentee management is not working. I will yry another place near here for next time i need to freshen this pad. I can fit my quilts but not this. Lots of put of service and only 2 sizes small 275 and 525. I needed the 350 size lol
__label__2	Had a burger and wings and the food was good.  The staff was friendly, but the service was hap-hazard.  We were originally seated by the bar, but the volume of the country music made it so we could not talk to each other...we then moved to another room, where there was a really loud group, but it was better than the country music.  I would not go back, as I do not drink and there are places with comparable food, and better ambiance, closer to home.
__label__2	Ate dinner last weekend and the service was extremely subpar. Our waitress took our drink order and did not even know their beer or vodka choices. Then after about thirty minutes of not having our order taken or drinks refilled we complained to the manager who told us he would pay for a round of drinks and keep an eye out for our table.  The waitress didn't seem to care and our service was terrible for the rest of the evening. We complained again to the manager who didn't seen to care.  Needless to say I expected much more.  We will not be going back.
__label__2	The pizza is great. Fresh ingredients and a great variety. Customer service has really gone down hill. After a bad experience it will be awhile before I visit.
__label__2	I was disappointed with this place. Their pho soup was ok (b-), and their grilled beef was really bad. Although the whole family came to this place hungry - grilled beef was left untouched. Cleanliness of the place is B-/ C. Parking is in the back. You can see a lot of students: food is cheap there, can't argue. But you get what you pay for...
__label__2	Disappointed to say the least after reading all these great reviews. First of all, I was shocked at the waiters attitude. When I began my order he leaned back and made a face as if I spat at him (definitely did not). Then when my food was brought out it was cold... I'm not pleased with this experience a bit and probably will not be coming here again. The food will taste good I'm sure.. After I go home and microwave it to the right temperature.
__label__2	Pizza had a weird taste to it. Lots of sauce and lacking cheese not a fan of this pizza joint.  Many people seem to think this is the best pizza in philly.  They are wrong.
__label__2	I have been to this location 4 times for dip.  The final results were good.  The first time the guy kept leaving me and cashing out and checking in clients and answering the phone.  The last two times I notice a dirty towel from other clients under my hands.  And while the owner was  working on me, another client came in to have her full set removed and the owner sat her beside me and clipped her nails with the same clippers she just used on me.  My daughter had gotten a full set at the same time and one of her nails fell off in two days.
__label__2	Honestly I was not sold on the tacos. Felt over priced and did not taste the greatest. The employees were all very nice but I just think the tacos are a rip off for what you get. We also got the guacamole and chips which were fine but also felt over priced for what we got. Huge Townes Van Zandt fan tho.
__label__2	"At first I thought I might be too Caucasian, but my Asian husband didn't like the food either.

I love hot and sour soup, but theirs tastes like vinegar.  Odd.  The cashew chicken has more water chestnuts than chicken, and the fried rice has bean sprouts mixed in, not on the side.  Not my fave.

Prices are great, but not worth it.  We didn't even take home our left-overs."
__label__2	The fish taco's were mediocre... what really ruined this place was the extremely loud live music. There was no where to get away from it. So loud you couldn't even have a conversation with the people at your table...  The wait staff was super friendly, but just couldn't get past the loud noise.
__label__2	I looked for a menorah in the holiday section and couldn't find one.  Also every employee I asked had no idea what a menorah was.  A menorah is basically a Christmas tree for Jewish people and y'all should have had one.
__label__2	We have tried this place several times. During the week, weekend, at a variety of times. Every time the service has been very slow and food is just ok. Even when not busy (4 other customers) eating we cannot get in and out in less than an hour. Drinks are very weak and everything seems slightly over priced, especially for the quality. Orders are never correct (ask for no cheese and yet still comes with cheese on it, etc)
__label__2	"Meh.

For bein established inside Circus Circus, this is one of the most dull places to eat.

The hostess and the servers lacked warmth, or anything even resembling energy.

The food was okay. Nothing to write home about.

A bit over priced.

And the coffee tastes like the dead souls of sad clowns."
__label__2	Jury still out. Housekeeping not good. Not enough towels or even bath mat. Room not clean. Will call front desk and see if can fix!  Up date to come....
__label__2	I had Green Pest Solutions for a little over a year and I am still experiencing mice problems.They have good customers but it seems as though they're feeding the mice instead of keeping them out of my house.  Due to no results and also being very pricey I chose to discontinue their services.
__label__2	"Food is good, ambience is not bad, but the customer service is horrible. Do not go there for lunch on Fridays... It will take a long time to get your food after cold soup and spring rolls. It will take a long time to get the hot sauce or paper napkins even though you ask for it specifically.
They need to improve on their attitude towards the customers. All they do is ask you 'how is everything' right after handing the check. Do not go there for dinner....overly pricey and not worth wasting your money."
__label__2	This two star review is based on service. I arrived with some kids 5 min before closing. Their open sign was lit. The staff was rude, and made it clear they wanted us to leave. We left about 7 min after the official close. Awful staff, mediocre ice cream.
__label__2	"Meh, ok sports bar if that's what you want.  Slow service, dirty and horrible music ... like they bought ""Best of Crap 80s Band -Versions 1-10"".  Loud and unimpressive.  If you want a better bar that's close head across the street to Southtown Pub.  The only interesting thing is the Skeeball, but that's not enough to make me come back."
__label__2	I really, really love Lush's products. However, Lush needs more sales! I went into Lush super early the one day, (December 26th), in the whole year that Lush has a sale to find everything was gone! The company itself has very good, non-synthetic products but they are priced far too high for the value. Also, this particular lush is very crowded and not very manageable. The Body Shop is better value as its products are made naturally like Lush and almost as good for nearly half the price of Lush.
__label__2	The coffee is decent enough, but they do not carry muffins or sweet rolls to go with it.  You have to walk across to another shop and wait on line again.  Today, the other shop was closed until a later hour, and then said they don't carry pastries on Thursdays or Fridays.  Next time I'll go elsewhere.
__label__2	"I think prices have gone up since the previous reviews.  The food is ok - good but not great and the prices are high.  Sorry but there are better places to go in the area.

Also - based on the yelp listing we thought this would be a good place for kids - there is no kids menu and nothing really ala carte but sushi.  Our kids split an entree but I would not really recommend this restaurant to anyone who has kids that don't enjoy sushi."
__label__2	We went there last night and the bartender was wasted and the server was drinking the whole time. Sushi was ok, but have heard their kitchen is very unsanitary by a former cook.
__label__2	This place is good for run through food. Its not really a nice sit down area. I went after red dress run last year an luckily we had seats in the back. It was ok. But really just ok.
__label__2	The hibachi was very good.  The sushi was awful.  The hibachi has nicely prepared steak and large shrimp.  The spicy tuna sushi was the minced variety and had an off taste, I didn't eat it.  Service was friendly.
__label__2	Good for a quick bite! My coffee is usually burnt, the bagels are hard, my main complaint is that it takes a long time to get your food, even if there is barely anyone in the cafe! It took 20 minuets for me to get a bagel and cream cheese the other day! Probably won't return. rather go to the sandwich shop next door.
__label__2	My boyfriend and I went for dinner tonight. It wasn't too busy, especially for a Friday night. We saw or waitress maybe 2 times during our visit. Left a lot of our unused dishes on the table so there wasn't much room once our food had arrived. Waited for about 45 minutes for our food. Although it was good, customer service was not too great.
__label__2	Service was rude and arrogant, which comes with the territory, but I was hoping the cheese steak and fries would make up for it. Unfortunately I was disappointed.
__label__2	First impressions really go a long way, and our welcome here last night left about as bad a taste as their overpriced dumplings. Although the range of flavors was diverse and fun, their prices are too steep for something you can get better in a frozen food aisle of ShopRite. Save your time and money by just ordering dumplings from some generic Chinese bodega. The service was lifeless, the atmosphere was hardly even worth the idea of late night drunk food, and by the time you got enough to be satisfied, you'll probably have to take out a loan from your local bank.
__label__2	Though I thoroughly enjoy the recliners and more extensive food options the amount of talking in the theater was ridiculous. And when other audience members tried to quiet the talkers it resulted in a profanity filled yelling match. Many of them were teenagers without parent or guardian which was surprising for a R-rated movie and makes me wonder if IDs are checked. I don't recommend this theaters if you want to watch a movie without disruption.
__label__2	This isn't about the workers. They are really working as hard as they can. But the movie theatre clearly did not set them up for success tonight. You couldn't get Pepsi, pretzels or any big food other than popcorn or nachos. The managers weren't in sight trying to help. You could tell the workers were worried about upset customers. They were all pleasant though. Please appreciate your workers that worked this Monday night because they tried with basically nothing. The bathrooms were gross and the seating definitely needs to be updated.
__label__2	old motel dirty pool and hot tub staff was nice it was cheap tho good for a cheap vacation
__label__2	Odd menu and limited beer selection. I am an IPA drinker and have found that Bar Louie does not usually have many to offer. Their menu is very limited and their service is very slow. I have given this place multiple tries and have been unfortunately disappointed every time. I will not return and cannot recommend this restaurant to anyone.
__label__2	Nothing special, but thought I should note that there are slim pickings in terms of food and beverages once you pass through security.  Everything was shut when I arrived at 4pm on a Wednesday, and only one a few areas were open on Saturday morning.  Make sure you have everything you need before going.
__label__2	"Service as usual in New Orleans is mediocre, unfriendly
I can't generalize, but that's how it is in canal and bourbon
The French market has nicer people"
__label__2	Not my cup of tea.  This place is a noisy, crowded mess.  If you want an Irish pub-like experience, go drink at Sassafras across the street.  The Irish guy over there will take good care of you.
__label__2	"This will be brief, mostly because my visit was brief but my experience was consistent with previous times so I wanted to rate... 
Pros: fast service, drinks are fine.
Cons: poor service, careless manners."
__label__2	Service at times was good I got 4 refills but at other times when you needed something while you were eating the server was not around. The one sandwich was wrong and my burger wasn't hot. Someone on yelp said to ask for spicy ketchup when I did I got mustard. I guess they don't have it or the server didn't know what it was. I've been hear maybe 10 times and most of the time the service is below average. The red robin in oxford valley is much better.
__label__2	The pasta was decent but the wings were the worst I'd ever seen. After attempting to at least give them a try it felt like eating rubber or something unknown. I had to create a yelp account to share my disappointment. Again, the pasta was fine.
__label__2	I was initially happy with this company, as the owner Dan came by to inspect the problems I was having with my deck and gave me some good advice, including a verbal quote for repairs. However, every attempt at contacting him since then has been ignored. Over 10 calls, over 20 texts. Emails. Facebook. Sadly, this company is ignoring me completely, which I find very unprofessional. For that reason, I need to leave a bad review so others know that this is not the contractor to hire.
__label__2	I don't think they know how to use their brick oven. Ordered three pizzas, all came overcooked. Not that it would have mattered much, as the crust and sauce were tasteless. On a bright note, the greek salad was tasty. But, the place is not called Greek Salad Cafe.
__label__2	"The only thing I like about this bar is the neat ceiling fans.  Other than that, I hate this place with a burning passion and have no idea why anyone would want to wait in line on a weekend to pay a $5 cover for an already crowded bar when there are so many other good establishments in the area.   

Drinks are way overpriced, patrons are douchey, food is pretty bland.

Go anywhere else!  You'll thank me later."
__label__2	"Considering the options around the campus, they can get away with charging about 2 dollars more per item than it's worth (plus tax). It's a little ridiculous that a sandwich, fries and a drink at a little hole in the wall type place should cost 10+ dollars.

The food is good though, just not good enough for what their charging. Taking advantage of college students because of the area and hiding behind the ""friends"" moniker isn't fooling me. 

Half of these reviews are also the owner's friends trying to bump up their reviews. Not cool."
__label__2	Colol if you're just here for the rooftop bar but don't stay here: shower handle popped off, long hairs on the floor, weird lighting, no night stands, messed up electrical outlights, a toilet that isn't mounted properly, and outlets that aren't grounded properly.
__label__2	"Service : Very Good

Food: left a lot to be desired, for example...
Ceviche - not a hint of lime, bland.
Carbonara - totally bland...adding salt didn't help
Octopus - overcooked, bland.

They had a great atmosphere and a good wine list, reasonably priced.

I'd think twice before going back."
__label__2	Extremely disappointed. We did not finish half of the food we ordered.  The fried pickles tasted terrible. The debris fries had a poor gravy with substandard meat. We're in New Orleans - why would you make debris with deli beef? The only reason I gave two stars is because the burgers were pretty good. Would never go back.
__label__2	"This place was a complete let down. It has the history and ambiance but the drinks were absolutely disgusting. From someone who enjoys well made cocktails and my wife who also enjoys them this was by far the worst. We ordered a Sazerac. They don't have Sazerac Rye... Nor do they have any other Rye than well... If you're looking for a good Cocktail bar skip this one or come in for water to hydrate or beer (can't mess that up) to look at the history. 

1 star for ambiance 
1 star for its history"
__label__2	I will not be taking my dogs back here again. The way I was personally treated by customer service (on multiple occasions) has made me wonder how they are truly treating my dogs. There's never a report on how their stay was, and I don't get the sense that anyone cares.
__label__2	This WaWa usually stresses me out, the space is so small, and usually filled with college students who are always in the way or rude Penn/Drexel employees. You can tell good customer service isn't a priority (or at a majority of the wawa locations in Philly). I only go into this location out of convenience.
__label__2	Finding vintage clothing in this store is a daunting task. The last few times that I have been here I haven't found anything that I like.
__label__2	"Love the food, but service it terrible. I had a lady take my order in the drive through, and I thought that she got me a diet coke instead of a coke. When I asked her if we got it right, she got sassy and said ""I literally said just a coke."" Terrible way to treat a customer."
__label__2	No wasabi very small portions very disappointed was very interested in this place but the sushi was not great and I was very disappointed and called and they said to call grub hub.  Um I ordered and paid food from you and u told me to call grub hub.
__label__2	Would have been 5 stars if they didn't treat their business like a hobby. Great food but it just isn't professionally ran. Funky hours. No real staff. Can also be a bit pricey for fountain sodas as it is the smallest cup available by Pepsi and there is no free refills. The food is great - not questioning that. It is just everything else that a restaurant should have it lacks.
__label__2	The atmosphere was great. I loved all the decor. The downside was the fact that I did a blow dry and curl which only lasted around 4 hours. I left the salon around 5 and I had a dinner at 9. By the time I got to dinner I only had a few curls left. The next morning my hair looked completely straight.  Very disappointed after I paid a good amount to get it curled and it didn't even last me a night.
__label__2	We discovered this little gem of a diner a few months ago and had a few meals there - the service and food were so good!  We had since moved out of town, and this past week we were in the area and were really looking forward to eating here again.  Well, the food was marginal and the service was...polite, but resigned.  Definitely a difference in atmosphere and change in the food quality since our last visits  :(  Doubt we will  be back.
__label__2	Love their chicken but HOLY HECK what do they do back there? Ordered pickup at 11:30, and even with a ridiculously long (1/2 hour) lead time they missed the mark. There was no one in the reatairant, and no orders ahead of mine. It's just not worth it. I've had no better luck eating in. Great chicken, awful experience. Probably won't be back.
__label__2	"I don't understand why this is so popular. I suppose that it's because it's a ""St. Louis Landmark."" However, I didn't think that what they had was really that great. It was okay but not great. I suppose that you have to have had it since you were little to think that if's terrific, but I don't. Maybe the prices might have something to do with it's popularity, too."
__label__2	Great friendly people not so great food. Burgers under-seasoned, and they got my order wrong but everyone else's order was correct. My burger and chips lacked flavor, bacon was undercooked, and the mushrooms appeared to be straight out of the can.
__label__2	"Maybe I've just ordered the wrong entrees but in the couple times I've been here, the food was not hot, and just not very good overall. The appetizers are better, with the crab cake being my favorite. 

I'd recommend going for brunch or lunch as that seems to be more popular and well-received."
__label__2	Tried it. Don't think I'll go back. Food is overpriced and wasn't that good. Drinks were ok. Has a nice interior.
__label__2	Got the Bugsy Burger and fries.  The fries were delicious, crispy, and salty.  The burger was a decent size, but there was not a lot of bacon on it (honestly, Checker's Baconzilla has more) and the bun was burnt.  And the wait was long.  I don't think I will be going back.
__label__2	The service was slow and the fish smell was overwhelming. My beer was a it warm and it was way too over crowded. The music was too loud and in your face.
__label__2	Very nice people. Great place for a simple men's haircut, but if you want anything else, go somewhere else. I gave specific instructions and they were simply ignored. I was given a classic men's haircut, which was radically different from what I asked.
__label__2	A very odd melange of a Mexican menu with loud nightclub music and decor. Food is edible, but not very good. We tasted most dishes without completing them. Service is lackadaisical and bar service is lamentably slow. We will not be back.
__label__2	"The staff are super nice without a doubt. I have three small dogs and their yearly exam and shots added up to $850. Then one went in for their yearly dental to the tune of $530. 

Charges were not fully explained nor was I advised of those that were not completely necessary. 

My expectation is a full breakdown of fees and a post surgical consultation by the Doctor. Neither happened. I'm still in shock over the $850 for the yearly exam. 

Your bedside manner is subpar. You ask me to spend a large amount of money I expect my hand to be held. 

You have lost my business."
__label__2	"Originally, we loved this and the experience! It's a golf cart that drives around town. They can give you a lift somewhere or just drive you for fun. There's no ""fee""- it's only tips for the driver. We tipped the driver, Sam, $20 at the end of the drive and he requested more money. The rudest request I've ever had. The driver also didn't wear a mask at all."
__label__2	"Celebrated a friend's move to a new city here and wow was it pricey. I expected that. But I felt as if we didn't get what we paid for. We ordered apps and drinks but one of the appetizers was ""stuffed peppers"" with goat cheese I believe. We were excited to try but very disappointed when the dish came out and the peppers were smaller than my thumb, all fitting in a sauce cup. Maybe we ordered wrong with just getting apps, but I wasn't impressed for all the great things I've heard about Union 50."
__label__2	This place is brand new. Last time I went, had a bad service. It took 45 mins to serve simple order for 2. Hoping that the service will improve, I went went with my friends this time. Very bad service. It takes more than 1hr to serve party of 4. My friends walked out without having anything because they were very hungry and wanted to grab something in another restaurant before they close. Food taste is just fine, but very expensive. Had better Indian food for less price in Tampa. I hope they improve on their service and reduce thr price.
__label__2	We went to eat here for lunch buffet the other day. Something changed with this place's food. The quality is not up to par. The dosa's were greasy. They couldn't fill the tandoori chicken fast enough and people were waiting. The goat, although I don't eat it, was not filled, just a pan full of juice (noticed when my dad was trying to get some). I probably won't try this place again unless I hear someone say it got better.
__label__2	Out of everything. If I ordered water I'm sure they would run out eventually. There was over 5 of us and they gave us one serving of bread, who am I Aladdin? Really though they were out of those go to appetizers and I always get and also the main meal...please order more inventory if you know your good NY to be out of it.
__label__2	"Not that crowded. Sunday night at 6:56 I put my order in for a large cheesteak. Finally got my sandwich at 7:36 pm. Took it home and opened it up. WHERE ' S THE BEEF TONY? IT WAS ABOUT 85% ROLL AND 15 % meat. Not very flavorful meat either.
Oh well. I tried. Just not my idea of a steak. You may disagree."
__label__2	I've been to this location many times and it seems that the service declines each time.  It always takes forever for the food to come out once we've ordered and this past time the waitress was in such a hurry to get rid of us.  The food is meh - typical bar food of wings, burgers, fried appetizers.
__label__2	Both my husband and I got diarrhea after eating there tonight. We have dined there many times and enjoyed the experience but this unfortunately must have been  food born illness.
__label__2	If you're into really salty over cooked wings then this is the place for you! I guess when you're swilling Bud Light by the pitcher with your bros it doesn't matter that every wing sauce they have is salty AF. I'm sure that's the point. So many better places to get quality pub grub and beer in the area to return to BWW.
__label__2	This location has a really rude drive-thru person... They were really short with us and seemed annoyed that we were there at all. Drinks were made fast but the customer service was terrible.
__label__2	The drinks were great but this is a waste of money the lobster Mac and cheese is disgusting noodles were over cooked and had maybe 2 pieces of lobster in it. Not worth $16.
__label__2	I am confused in what to write as my ears still hurt the next day from the high noise level in this restaurant. The fried fish was decent, the clam chowder was excellent. The service sucked, but it is a pub. The drinks are tiny (four sips max). The noise level was like listening/watching the space shuttle launch in person. Not really toddler friendly...Sushi was a total...eh.
__label__2	"The hostess and waitress are 5 stars. The morning mimosa was delicious.  Beautiful decor and nice atmosphere.
     Just can't fathom why the sauce in the shrimp and grits was white. Literally thin gross white sauce. Odd sour taste.  Couldn't eat more than one bite.  
   I wish I would have tried something else because the neighboring table seemed to be thoroughly enjoying there breakfast. I must admit, it looked delicious.  But I didn't feel the need at the time to try anything different here considering all of the options available."
__label__2	"Ordered this tonight from ubereats and I should've known better than to order from a pizza place near bourbon. A step up from frozen pizza. Also ordered some Alfredo pasta which ubereats said was a ""top seller"" and it was literally inedible - no flavor besides the overabundance of oregano to make up for the lack of actual cheese. Wish I could get my money back for it, but you win some, you lose some. This was a loss."
__label__2	The menu is pretty robust, and claims to be fresh, but I'm reasonably confident I was just served frozen cheese sticks and a Stoufers lasagna.  Maybe the sandwhiches and salads are better.
__label__2	This used to be my favorite Thai restaurant. But they sent me home with the wrong meal and instead of refunding my money, they made me drive back to the restaurant and get another one. I won't be wasting my time ordering from them again since their customer service has gotten so bad. Very sad state of affairs.
__label__2	This hotel has always been a good one. On my last visit there was hardly any water pressure and the water barely hit enough to shower with. Boo!
__label__2	Went there opening week. Staff is friendly for sure we were greeted right away. But the food prices are high and it was all al la cart. 17 bucks for a burger, fries, and a drink. That's a bit pricy for my liking
__label__2	Poor service. The waitress was average at best and we had a very long wait on a Saturday afternoon with hardly anyone in the restaurant.  With as many good quality steakhouses in central Indiana, there are far better choices than this one
__label__2	Great place if your diet requires bland food. The plain white rice was probably the more flavorful item on my plate.
__label__2	The service was great. The waitress has a great attitude. The food wasn't good at all. Maybe my choice of food? I ordered the blackened fish torta and it was more bread than anything else, the fish was not seasoned as I would expect blackened fish to be, it was also under cooked so I only ate a bit. Chips were okay but no sauce was offered. I left most of the food on the plate. The place is okay if you're staying at one of the hotels but order something else. If you don't mind the walk, there's much better places in Downtown
__label__2	Stopped in one night after work , around 5:45 and the place was empty. Ordered the chicken and yellow rice. There were 2 young guys working there....let me rephrase that there were 2 guys standing around looking bored . Poor service and poor food. The chicken looked as though it had been sitting around for days , 2 tiny legs and the yellow rice was dry. Black beans were too salty. WAY OVERPRICED !! .I DON,T KNOW HOW THIS PLACE STAYS IN BUSINESS. I will not be back or suggest this place to my friends.
__label__2	Ate here twice, different menu items each time. Okay, but not the best use of my time, money, or tastebuds. Not a horrible experience, but very indifferent.
__label__2	"Slow and unenthusiastic service. I made a mobile order that said 15-20 minutes. I showed up 15 minutes. A little earlier. I was optimistic. I stood at the pick up table for 10 minutes until someone noticed me. ""Do you have an order?"" The worker sorted through the orders until she found my order then slowly made by order - after telling me they were out of every bagel I ordered (Asiago, everything, and green Chile), and my has brown sides. This place is terrible."
__label__2	"I inquired about boarding my cat here and had our former vet fax over my cat's records--which were up-to-date. Yet despite this, they insisted on a $69 ""consultation"" fee with the cat in order to board her. I have lived in many places at the point (e.g. CA, CT, PA, TX, NJ, NY) and I have *never* encountered such a policy; it seemed exploitative. I ended up not boarding the cat. I will try Montgomery Animal Hospital next time I need boarding services, hopefully all will go well."
__label__2	The food was very bland. The con queso was cold and the chicken in my enchilada had no flavor, but if I had had more sauce it might have helped. The best was the chorros beans. Our waitress was fabulous.
__label__2	Went to the Faust Park Food Truck Fest and tried the brisket loaded fries and the wings with a medium buffalo sauce. First off, the guy who took my order was so attitudinal and rude. The brisket loaded fries were mediocre, at best. The wings were good, hence the two stars, but not worth dealing with that kind of service. I'd rather support a place that is pleasant to their customers.
__label__2	they didn't even play taylor's music on 11/12. ordered her drink and atleast they knew of it...but no music. disappointed
__label__2	I really hate Wal Mart in general, but this staff seems to be nicer than other locations.  However, I am from Missouri originally and everything in the store is more expensive than I am used to.  I just assumed Wal Mart prices were universal.  Bathrooms are dirty.
__label__2	So I like the backyard beans nitro brew and I decided to come into the shop to see what it was like.  I was very dissappeared in my customer service experience by this blonde barrista.  She looked like a chicken with it's head cut off, very sporatic and really slow.  My order came out 25 minutes after I placed, I wasn't in a rush luckily but waiting that long is obscene for coffee.  It wasn't even that busy in the shop it just seemed like she had no customer service experience.  Buy the nitro cold brew stay away from the shop.
__label__2	I only give it two stars because the room was fairly clean.  Other than that, what a dump.  Area was super sketchy, didn't like parking my car in the lot, people hiding in the far end of the lot smoking who knows what.  The area is crummy, and I'm amazed my car wasnt broken into.  Ridiculous pricing, $150 for a tiny room but I needed a place to stay.  For the price, I'd stay in Ventura or Carpinteria and drive to Santa Barbara, lesson learned.
__label__2	Brought a friend today and it was understaffed. The woman working sent her bad mood vibes everywhere.  Our breakfast was cool at best.  I asked if we could get our table wiped and got snapped out.  I hate when a place becomes hit or miss.
__label__2	Was not impressed with this place at all. Overrated. Oysters were so big it seemed unusual. Had a different taste though. The chargrilled oysters could've been grilled a little longer. Shrimp po boy was not good. Shrimp tasted old. They tried to help but didn't do good. Maybe just wasn't their night. Management call themselves giving us a discount of 10%. Which wasn't enough. But hey, live and learn. Won't be coming back.
__label__2	"Terrible . My stylist rushed through the whole cut and when I seemed displeased, she began to attempt to school me in how much she knows about hair . 
The cape was ripped off me within 3 mins and I was told to look at the ground to prove that she had done at least something to my hair . 

10/10 would not recommend"
__label__2	I have been here a couple of times with friends after work.  The food is marginal at best and beer selection is decent.  If I had a choice, I would have driven out further to Iron Hill Brewery for good beer and food.
__label__2	I was never a fan of this place. They have alright pizza, but it's definitely an old divorcee kind of place.
__label__2	When you're surrounded by pizza places you'd think you'd up your game.  Sadly no, I had a shell and cinnamon twists.  Both way over done, my shell was burnt and the twists were crunchy with caked on cinnamon.  I threw those away as well as the shell.
__label__2	Used to eat here years ago but moved away.  Recently tried again and it was terrible.  Dirty dirty dirty is all I can say.  Oh yeah did I mention dirty?  The son that runs it now is all about the $ and could care less about the family tradition of quality.  You grossly over stuff your sandwiches to try and validate their high price.  The giant deviled crab totally sucked.  Was not crispy at all.  So, dirty and overpriced low quality food.  If that is what you like, then you might like Brocatos.
__label__2	"Cozy BYOB.  Service was a little strange with the wine but the people were really nice.  

Food was okay.  Avocado spread was interesting -- not bad.  Meat was tough, overcooked -- disappointing.  Fish was all right -- not bad but not amazing either.

I feel bad because they're so nice, but I wouldn't want to go back.  There's better food to be had."
__label__2	The food is definitely not worth what you pay. There are other places in the Tampa area with better Italian food for an equal or better price. I do have to say though that the service was very good. Our server was very attentive and our food came out in a timely manner. Overall, I probably wouldn't go back because there are better places around.
__label__2	"Went there twice, once for breakfast and then for dinner. Couldn't be more disappointed both the times.. I couldn't understand how this restaurant got so many positive reviews. Tried Benedict for the breakfast, there was no hollandaise sauce on the eggs. It looked like a rushed job and was tasteless. 
Similar experience for dinner, tried gumbo and jambalaya, rushed job resulted in cold food and didn't even taste that great. I would not recommend, the ratings are deceptive."
__label__2	Bigger than what it looks on pics. No customer service and no legit food. Food was frozen and not well cooked. Never again.
__label__2	I go to In and Out all the time and have for years, this was the worest meal I have ever had there. The burger was chard around the edges, and very dry, onions were burned,bun was chard also. Get you act together.
__label__2	Food could have been good if it was hot. The cheese tots were large and full of potential but when you're eating in and immediately after being served it should be at the very least warm. It was very cold. The southern biscuit again was good but served almost cold. Best thing was the maple donut which was very fresh and good.
__label__2	Overpriced ice cream that really isn't all that good. Not to mention the extremely slow service.
__label__2	"Went in to federal donuts because I heard about it on ig .... I walked in a young black gentleman greeted me and took my order ... the Caucasian woman with reddish / brownish hair young  at the register was rude when I was paying she asked me ""what's your name "" for  I said Oh Hi ... very bad customer service from her ... will probably not go back again or recommend... donut was just ok"
__label__2	A joke of a small garden with a koi pond. Just a small house where you check out the rooms and read the descriptions you can find in a middle school history book. Be prepared to take your shoes off so wear socks.  Not worth the $12.00 admission for 10 minutes of minimal wow factor. Hardly, worth checking out.
__label__2	Food and beer were ok. Service was pretty much non-existent. The only reason I left a tip at all was the bill was $19.52 and I didn't want to wait for the lethargic bartender to run my credit card or bring change for a $20.
__label__2	"Very average food. I ordered Renzo's parilla and most of the beef cuts had a lot of fat so ultimately it wasn't as meaty as I expected for the price. 

I had a ham and cheese empanada which arrived to my table stiff and at room temperature. I asked my server if she could warm it up and she said yes but brought it back in the same condition. The empanada was very bland overall 

Refills are not free. I got a refill on my coke and got charged for two.

I would not recommend this place"
__label__2	I ordered the Prime Rib which was respectable. The Mushroom and Onion side wasn't very good at all. My wife's steak was respectable and presented well absent the Peppercorn sauce which was heavily laden with salt and lacked any peppercorns I could see  (perhaps the Chef got the Salt and Peppercorns mixed up). I suspect this was a poorly made batch sauce. Spoke to the waitress about it but our subtle comments were met with a slight shrug. Otherwise the service was exceptional . Time for a new Chef who understands how to prepare an au Poivre  sauce properly!
__label__2	Poor overall service. I've given them many chances over the years. The pizza is never consistent. Lately, it's been really bad. I have decided to just not order from here anymore. I hope this place can get better,
__label__2	I got the catfish special for$8.99. I was very disappointed in the quantity and quality. I like their salads but have been disappointed here several times. Sorta an excuse during shut down, but no excuse today.
__label__2	I really loved their subs. It was always my go to spot for a sub. Recently I have tried numerous times to call an order in with no success. Every time I've called they quickly put me on hold and after 6 minutes of waiting I get frustrated and hang up. I've tried this 4 different occasions on different days with the same results. I have officially decided not to bother bringing my business to them anymore.
__label__2	"So....boo. 

I haven't even left this place and I'm giving a review. Extremely slow service. The waitress rarely checked in during the 1.5 hours we sat at this table waiting for our dinner to arrive. When we commented on how long it was taking to receive our meal, she didn't seem to care. Don't waste your whole evening at this place."
__label__2	"Food is just okay here, but the past two times we've gone, they've messed up our order (both times with the soup).  The second time I decided to say something, and the manager promptly got me a refund.

Not going here again because they can't even get our order right.  Plus I've always found the food to be overpriced and mediocre."
__label__2	Went there for the first time. I walked in on a Friday around 10 and I was the only person in there. Willie made me kind of skeptical to stay and eat.Order french toast eggs and a soda the bill was almost twelve bucks.the the French toast comes on round bread which really was not tasteful the eggs were very good the server was really nice. I think their prices are way too high. Don't really think I would go back again
__label__2	"Zac the driver was decent but no information given about the wineries as we approached. First winery Rune"" very picturesque and decent wine . Second place "" The Meading  Room "" was ok but it should not be included in wine tasting tour "" awful sweet insipid  mead not wine .Third winery was Hops and wine ""  better but not exciting . 
The other party aboard contained a horrible rude obnoxious guy who should not be allowed out in public . Used foul language calling names to our party acted like a juvenile delinquent  but I guess these days any sort of behavior is acceptable by Az wine tours ."
__label__2	I was very uncomfortable going in for pick up. Employees were not wearing masks and gloves! I won't go back until there is a vaccine.
__label__2	"I know this isn't the mall's fault, but the number of children running around unwatched was intolerable. 
The mall doesn't seem to have much more than it did before, nor would I call it an outlet collection.
I'd go back just for the NM outlet, which is, thankfully, right by the entrance. 

It was at least clean. But it was insanely hot in all of the stores."
__label__2	Seems like a great place to get drinks with friends but dinner was sub par. Mexican quesadilla far from delivered. No cheese, they used breaded chicken, it just didn't hit. Buffalo chicken fingers were good but nothing special. Service was eh. I will not return with all of the other options in the area.
__label__2	As one of our friends have been raving about their baked squids for years, I finally visited the restaurant.  The baked squids were O-K, but not as good as they were advertised to be.  Other dishes that we ordered were OK as well but nothing special. The drab, rundown look of the place didn't help either.  I don't think I'll be going back....
__label__2	Worst experience with property management ever they have too many different people answering questions that have different answers for the same issue. They take a long time to resolve issues. They don't explain clearly how they move in process take the. I'm 51 years old and never lived anywhere that doesn't prorate you move in cost. We moved in on the 14th the full month was due and two weeks later it was dues again the full amount. The longest lease I have ever saw 41 pages long full of jargon that's not fullly understandable without a lawyer.
__label__2	"Update:  I still really enjoy dining here, and the bar guys David and Patrick are still great... but I have to mention that the booze prices are outrageous... they offer low-end wines like Barefoot and Cupcake, then charge per glass enough to buy TWO FULL BOTTLES of the stuff at Walmart or total Wine... same ripoff with the beer. I am fine with a reasonable profit... but this is nasty.

Too bad, sort of puts a damper on the enjoyment."
__label__2	I have been to this Yardhouse before and it was a great dining experience. Tonight because I was along I was asked to sit at the bar.  That was a huge mistake, unless you like being ignored by the bartenders for 20 minutes while they talk with their friends. Once they finally took my order my food came out quickly.  Not as good as before, I think I'll have to pass on this location in the future.
__label__2	Mediocre food at its best. The plates are weird shaped and the food is nothing to write home about. I asked for a side of ranch dressing and got charged extra! Wow. Prices are outrageous for what you really get. Home fries where soggy and bland and the pancakes that we got where raw in the middle. I will not come back to this place.
__label__2	Been here a few times.  I really want to like this place since it is close to home, I like the atmosphere and the menu items sound good, but I just can't.  Service is never great.  You repeatedly have to ask for things.  The waitstaff sometimes acts like it's a chore to wait on you.  Food can be hit or miss depending on the day.
__label__2	I just threw up all the left over food i ate the night before at this place. Maybe it was me being absolutely unlucky with the food but just wanted to warn people who are interested to step into this place. The staff are very warm and hospitable, the food is always wag too spicy to be able to differentiate between different dishes and different flavors, at least for me. Anyhow, after last night experience,  I'm gonna kiss this place bye bye and no Nirvana for me anymore. Stay well people!
__label__2	The food was OK... no one in our party of four was overly ecstatic about their meal. Don't order the Marsala because it had no flavor. The whole experience was terrible because it was like an ice box. I tied two black napkins together to make a shawl. The waitress gave us a bit of an attitude when dropping off the checks. I won't be back.
__label__2	Im a big fan of Chicago pizza-- but this location specifically doesn't know how to make it. It's come burned the last several times I've ordered. I won't be ordering again and do not recommend this to anyone.
__label__2	I've never really enjoyed this place. My boyfriend was obsessed with it for a while so I have given it many tries. At first it was ok food was decent and service was great. It wasn't until recently when they expanded to the other side that I was just over it. Service was terrible and food was just bland. Never got a refill on my drink even after asking.
__label__2	"I tried a new place while in town for the eclipse. I had the lunch special shrimp lo mein. The noodles were spaghetti. The shrimp is just frozen and warmed up, not fresh. The mushrooms were from a can and there was no flavor, no stirfry nothing to make it tasty. I do not recommend this place.

Staff was nice .   ThAt is all"
__label__2	Definitely one of the oldest and worst baseball stadiums I have been to.  Its a weird vibe in here for baseball and just wasn't what I would expect for a Florida complex.  Tickets and parking are cheap however but there is absolutely nothing unique about this place.  Come once and never return..wink
__label__2	"The entire time while I was eating the sandwich, I kept thinking to myself, ""I don't understand what all the hype is about with this muffuletta!"" It was premade ready, cold, and although the olive salad was good, it was a bit too salty. This is definitely not a place you should go for an absolute ""must try"". Not to mention, with that price, I would prefer a poboy."
__label__2	"Good food, but small portions and we always have to check our order as something is wrong or missing. Also way too pricey for the area.  Other places we've found that are less expensive but just as good.

**Update, as of Aug 2018 they're no longer offering $1 kids meals on Sunday according to the cashier.  Bummer!"
__label__2	Place just opened up. Pizza was okay. Didn't have a salad. Two pizzas and two drinks was $20.00, which seems a little high for the product. Owners are very confident of their business and their food. I'm not.
__label__2	"""British pub"" straight out of Wee Britain in Arrested Development.  Showing the NFL instead of the Premier League on Boxing Day."
__label__2	It's...ok.  I'm not sure what the big deal is.  It's an average burger with flaccid fries.  I'm a bigger fan of fries that have some crunch to them.
__label__2	Really disappointed. Ordered an acai bowl and asked for no honey and no granola. When I got my bowl back to my room and sat down to eat, I got half way through the bowl before getting a spoon full of granola. My body doesn't process granola well, so now I'm not only hungry, but get to wait and see if I'll be sick the remainder of my vacation.
__label__2	They use towels that leave red lint and water marks all over the car, and clean the windows with the same thing, always leaving streaks.
__label__2	The spring rolls were not good in the least. Was really excited to give these a try and was greatly disappointed! But the people working the stand were very nice!
__label__2	"We were very disappointed in this new museum. It was very unimaginative, with many placards just reciting basic facts about each performer - very few memorabilia, no interesting stories, and worst of all no chance to sample music as you went along! Having been to the Rock n Soul museum in Memphis, I guess I'm spoiled, but this leaves you just feeling ho-hum and not very informed.
Admission price is very unreasonable for the size and scope of this museum. I cannot recommend it."
__label__2	Inconsistent at best.  I have been there 3 times and I would say the first time was good, then it was barely decent and last weekend it absolutely sucked. The ambience is awful to start with.  The tall waiter from Mumbai is very kind and friendly.  The other guy was absolutely shocking.  The menu is great but the food is so inconsistent.  DO NOT GET COCONUT MILK with your appam or any other dish.  Absolutely the most disgusting thing ever.  I did not know Chicken 65 could be messed up and they managed to do that the last visit. Too much salt in most dishes and very oily.
__label__2	I do not like any chinese establishment that serves cuban yellow rice abd tried to pass it off as white in their fried rice. Not the best chinese , and not in the best neighborhood plaza.
__label__2	I really don't get why the heck this room was expensive. The room was soooooo small that one of the beds were pushed up against the the air condition. Which made the bed vibrate a little. There was no fridge or microwave and the bathroom was in the closet. The people up stairs sounded like they were moving the furniture around all night. I didn't sleep well at all. The room also had a faint smell of must and old air conditioner. More than likely won't stay there again.
__label__2	I can only attest to post 2:45am...the food is delicious, the service is absolutely awful. It's all about balance amirite?!
__label__2	The French toast is mediocre at best. For all of the positive reviews about the French toast at this restaurant, I would definitely pass on this item. Their coffee was average; I did not add any creamer or sugar and again not impressed. The service, however, was a different matter. From the hostess to to the servers, busboys, and bartenders, everyone is very friendly and eager to help.
__label__2	Went to this restaurant hoping to find a new place to get poboys close to my home. I ordered the roast beef poboy which the beef was very dry with little gravy but I did ask for a little more gravy which they brought to me. My wife ordered the Caesar Wrap which was bland with no taste. Not impressed and will not go back.
__label__2	It is a joke. Pizza was passable at best. The only reason to go is the history and the fact that you are welcome to roll in with a cooler of beer before a ballgame.
__label__2	Being an Executive Member, the wait was very long even with a reservation.  I arrived at the counter and was waiting with 2 customers in front of me.  One guy behind the counter and it took both customers 30 minutes to book a rental.  Very exhausting.  Finally the manager shows up and the computers were supposedly down, but you could rent vehicles.  No rental contract given or e-mailed to me.  Not a great process for having a reservation because everyone goes into the same queue.  Very tired business traveler.
__label__2	"Two stars, at best. I and a friend had dinner there. We live in Carpinteria. I had the beet burger with a Caesar side. The burger was OK at best. The Caesar salad was tasteless. I didn't eat it. The fries were good but the sauces on the side were not good. The only sauce with any taste was the ketchup ( most likely Heinz). My friend had the same reaction. 
This is the third time going there and the last for sure."
__label__2	Must be a new concept for the owners, who own several other restaurants in town. Because the flavor, size & ingredients consistency is always different. As if they're still learning how to cook as the go one... They should of had this down before opening...  Cool concept, but same dish is different every time.. I'll wait a while before returning..
__label__2	The only reason why they are getting two stars is because the sashimi was fresh and our server was named Marc Anthony. Over priced for crap sushi. The eel and avacdo roll tasted like crap and you can never go wrong with an eel roll. The sushi rice was bland and mushy. This place was not good. I should have convinced my party to go to Morimotos... O Philly when are you gona have slammin sushi at decent price??!
__label__2	"While on lunch on a Monday afternoon we decided to check this place out.  First off, the buffet food although there was a wide selection the quality was lacking.  I've had better quality Chinese buffet food several other places for quite a bit less money.

The only saving grace was their grill.  Fresh and tasty."
__label__2	Today we  visited the first time, but it is not that likely for us to return. The tortillas were cold and we had to send them back which they were kind to  do it promptly. The guacamole was decent and worth trying except that  the portion is quite small for a half order. Our server was lovely, warm, and friendly but the building was freezing on a cold winter afternoon.
__label__2	"Ordered 20 wings only... they didn't put any ranch dressing in there AT ALL!! Luckily I live close... went back and they said but it's just a chicken order.  Who eats chicken or at least yalllllllll's chicken w/o ranch.  ‍‍
So now I have to pay for the ranch that should've been included?  That's like paying for ketchup to go with the fries at McDonald's.   Do better Wingstop!"
__label__2	Long line, 4 tellers, 2 helping customers. A few people walked out,  which I would have done if I could. Unfortunately what I needed done had to happen with a teller. Have more people scheduled in the morning!
__label__2	Well first you might want to acknowledge customers when they first walk in.  And then you might want to treat them with some type of hospitality.  And then when they ask for a simple glass drink, give them that instead of 32oz growler.  Just bad.  Won't be back.  And thanks for standing there while you tell us to leave.
__label__2	Old Point, you disappoint.  The only redeeming quality of this establishment was their willingness to let dogs on the patio.  Now that that's gone, there's no need to tolerate the subpar food served in a smoky atmosphere by too cool for school hipsters.  You'll hear arguments from those that feel downtown restaurants can do no wrong, but save yourself the trouble and just go to Bourbon Street Distillery.
__label__2	***Temporary review**** I will place another review when your waitstaff doesn't ignore me. Gotta be able to order food and eat it to give an honest review.  Right?!?!!  Maybe it was just a bad day for her.  We all have them.  I will return soon.
__label__2	Açaí bowl was way too overpriced for what you got. The açaí blend its self was very boring, and the granola was plain. The cups that they give you are too small to not spill all over the place. Super bummed since I payed so much.
__label__2	"If you want to have your time wasted and want to  go visit another shop to undo their ""best in the county"" work. I recommend this place."
__label__2	I ordered the Panang curry from here today and it is not good. It literally has no flavor. Veggies are fresh. Tofu is a little dry but no flavor. This is the second time ordering from them and same situation. Won't be back.
__label__2	Rocking chairs are a saving grace! Otherwise, yuck! Perhaps this place will turn around when they finish all the reconstruction. The mall in the center is a nice touch, but it's not like I would go shopping at an overpriced airport anyway.
__label__2	Tried it twice. Won't try again. Not bad but service was slow for 230pm on a Saturday. Staff was pleasant, just short staffed.  Burgers have very little flavor. But the fries were good. I can get better burgers most anywhere.  And the Mac and cheese was bland too. Had high hopes for a burger place.
__label__2	This place is kind of the worst. Half the time they don't have grocery carts. Today they didn't have any produce bags. Last week my cherry tomatoes were moldy a day after I bought them. They seem constantly understaffed and I have a harder time finding what I need here compared to other grocery stores in the city that are way smaller.
__label__2	I used to eat here years ago and it was pretty good, but my last 2 recent experiences have been pretty bad.  The staff was very friendly, but the food was really greasy and poor quality.  The soapapilla dessert was also very bad as it was just a big lump of hollow dough with a littel cinnamon on it.  We wanted some authentic Mexian/TexMex, but this wasn't what we had in mind.  Take care and cya in Rivergate.
__label__2	"Very good and friendly service. Kolbey was attentive, friendly and professional. The 2 stars are for the food which was terrible. The nachos were awful. Soggy, queso tasted like canned cheese product, not enough toppings. Worst nachos I've ever had. 

Our server deserves 5 stars. The food deserved -2 stars."
__label__2	I used to love this place but recently it went down in flames with the overcooked fries the last 5 times I've been there, forgetting condiments, getting my order wrong on multiple occasions. I've been to all the culvers here in Tucson and this is the only one that does not greet you when you walk in and never really got that. The management seems nonexistent here.
__label__2	Very disappointed- waitress had attitude/ sausage was very dry, hostess asked to f I needed more coffee which I did because the waitress not attentive. I'm top there was a LONG wait for everything and they were not busy at all
__label__2	Prices super high for a thrift store. The employees are miserable. They have never been nice to me when I'm trying to purchase furniture or random items. Not my favorite thrift store in the city.
__label__2	What a waste!  $130 per person for a steak you can buy at a good butcher for $30. Great atmosphere,  food tasted better the next day as warmed-up leftover.
__label__2	From the time we approached the hostess stand without a hostess to the time of paying the check our experience evolved around a staff with little to no training. After requesting twice to speak to the floor manager the owner finally appeared. Instead of trying to repair her customers experience all she was concerned with was defending herself blaming her staff. Hint, if you do not want to spend your valuable time and money training your staff try hiring employees already trained and except an increase in employee cost.
__label__2	I want to like this place but the vibe is pretentious and the prices are soooo ridiculous that I just can't do it.
__label__2	"Friendly staff. Limited staff (waitress/hostess/bar tender all rolled into 1) Good drinks.

Dogs welcomed? They're all over the place...  Seriously!!! 

My friend had a hair on her ""peace maker"" poor boy... My lamb burger & fries were Great!!! 

Scenery while sitting outside on the sidewalk and eating was least of all entertaining."
__label__2	Screwed up my family's order on several occasions. Then give you attitude when you call and tell them. I'm talking big orders of near 100 dollars on our family pizza nights. We've given them a few chances but will not be ordering from them again!
__label__2	While this theater is in a great location and its matinee prices are great, the seating is atrocious. My wife and I did not want to sit in any of the seats as they were all worn beyond belief and seemed to have a distinct scent. Despite being 2 of only around 10 people at this matinee, we chose to sit at the far side of the theater as these seats seemed to have the least wear. We won't go back here again. Spend .50 more and go to a nicer theater.
__label__2	I was a big fan of Hatfield Pizza, but things started to change.  Everytime we would order food the portion, qulaity, and price was always different.  Also, the wait staff started to slip a little.  It got a little old ordering the same food at different prices each time.  The food is still good, just don't expect to get the same thing at the same price every time you order.
__label__2	A disappointing experience. The food was bland. Sticky rice had the consistency of a hockey puck. First visit to this restaurant since their move to Midtown. I don't know if there is new ownership, a new chef, or both, but Cafe de Thai isn't as good as it was at the old location. We won't be back.
__label__2	I think this place came under new ownership very recently.  I am not sad about it though.  I had a confrontation with the husband/owner after damage to a favorite dress.  He was always manic but unbearably rude that last time.  I go to Gina's now.
__label__2	Nice decor, old fashion style barber shop.  Free beer and soda.   The owner and barbers all appear to be fresh out of prison with facial and neck tattoos.  45 minute wait with an appointment.  Not coming back.
__label__2	Food was good but the service was abysmal. No people eating around us and we had to prompt the waitress to take our order, pay the check, etc. if you are in a hurry, forget it!!
__label__2	"I recently moved to the area, and decided to hit up Duck Deli on a lunch break.  

I got the pulled pork sandwich.  While the sandwich was good, it was nothing to write home about.  

The service was quick, and our server was polite.

The restaurant was clean and there is ample parking.

I will probably not go back to Duck Deli."
__label__2	Been here other times and it was better. This time just so so. Food was undercooked but sushi was good. Headliner was funny but early show was not even half full and crowd was not good. Why go to a comedy club if you are going to talk to each other loudly the entire time?!. Very distracting and rude  based on the crowd not surprised. Not sure I will go again.
__label__2	Great atmosphere, great beers and a menu that fills you with anticipation.   Then the food comes and its just kinda bland.  Sorry but I find this place a real dissappointment.
__label__2	What a disappointment. Had a cinnamon bun and coffee. The bun was dry and hard. Felt it was maybe left over from the day before. So hard that I had to use a knife and fork. This will most likely be my last time there.
__label__2	It may be organic but $7.49 for 12 oz latte with coconut milk? Nooooooo. That price point is not justified. Never again next time.
__label__2	Smells like trash 24.7 there's dog piss all over the carpet in the hallways. Extra bonus-- there's loud construction noise constantly starting at 6 A.M. M-Sat. Constant banging.
__label__2	Second time trying Uncle B's BBQ for takeout this month. First time noticed the portions were smallish and since we got mkt place 8oz and took them home I decided to weigh them. Both were less than 7oz including containers. Today we ordered similarly and the meat was correct but the meat was very dry! And then there's the $3 side of coleslaw! Picture tells the story!
__label__2	Standard Ethiopian food.  Ordered the Meskerem platter for two, and it was little food for the price. Should have cost half the amount charged. Looked like an appetizer plate. Guess we were supposed to fill up on the bread (injera) that you use to scoop up the food instead of utensils.  Was there on a Thursday at 5-6:00 pm and no one else showed up to eat. Should have been a tell tale sign. We will not return.
__label__2	M Street struck out with this one. There's so many other better mexican options in this city. Priced better and tastes better than Saint Añejo. Lastly, the atmosphere just isn't that cool, I'd rather be at Chuys. Queso Fundido do not order.
__label__2	"I went there for a Saturday brunch. Food looked amazing. However didn't taste good and took a long time to come out. The food was overcooked and under seasoned.  

They seem to have live music pretty often and when I walked by later in the evening it seemed to be a more exciting place. 

Not worth going to as the food just was not good and kinda pricy."
__label__2	I guess if your not looking for a NY pizza this maybe ok. The crust was flat and crispy not a dough style. Being from NY I like a pizza that folds. Cheese was good but the sauce was tasteless. The customer service was good.
__label__2	As of now Lagerheadz is FOREVER CLOSED.  It appears that their landlord no longer wished to lease the land to them. It was either buy the place outright or move on. Since they're not operating now, the choice was clear. Looking on their Facebook page, there was no indication this was coming.
__label__2	"Tina, who ""helped me"" did so by standing at the register, didn't say ""hello"", or ""can I help you"" nothing... just a blank stare. After an awkward moment, I said hello and placed my order, she wasnt paying attention. Burgers are good but staff are not fully engaged."
__label__2	In my head, I always remembered that La Salsa had decent, quick Mexican food. I have no idea when that culinary experience occurred, but the meal in my head no longer exists at La Salsa. Their menu is extremely limited and basically consists of some reheated meat, rice, beans, and cheese rolled in to the tortilla style of your choosing. The salsa's were all very bland and in general it was a very under whelming experience. It was fast, and it wasn't covered in unhealthy greases and oils, but that is about all the positive I experienced.
__label__2	Some of the fare on offer at That BBQ Place is wildly overpriced, especially given the fact that real cutlery, proper table service, and glassware are all missing.  While this place is as neat as a pin and while it offers very friendly service, I'm unlikely to return.  It won't matter, though, for it's busy enough that my custom is unlikely to be missed.  Their ribs still lack bark and they remain too moist for my liking.  In the end, Sherwood Parkers seem to like the place and that's all that matters for the owners.
__label__2	We were here for supper tonight. Our server was pleasant and promptly took our drink order. She returned and we gave our food selections. After the appetizers were served she disappeared and did not return for 45 minutes with the entrees. The restaurant was about 25% occupied so there was no apparent reason for this long delay. The manager apologized but had no explanation. The food was palatable but just barely. The chicken I had was dry and was only a breast not a half chicken I was expecting.  No reason to return any time soon.
__label__2	The fries i ordered to go were a rip off. I got a small handful of cold fries. I live maybe 5 min away and they werent even slightly warm
__label__2	The food is good, just be careful if you get something delivered when not using Grubhub. I called to have something delivered and added tip over the phone. The driver came to my door trying to get another tip out of me and became combative when I explained that I already paid a tip - even when showing him the receipt on the box that had a tip added.
__label__2	George's has a fantastic fresh seafood market. I buy fish here all the time and it is always good. However, we recently tried their take out dinners and they serve possibly the worst fried oysters I have had in my life. Pounded into a pulp heavily breaded and fried. No flavor at all. Tough as a hockey puck. They were impossible to eat and I threw them out. If you want some delicious fried oysters go to Hank's in the DC area.
__label__2	No more free chips and salsa in the bar.  No worries, I will not be back. Felt sick almost immediately after eating before I even paid the bill. The grossness and nausea I feel now will be forever be associated with Chilis. No nope not coming here again.
__label__2	Was in the mood to get a burger and decided to give this place a try. For a fast casual restaurant establishment, I was expecting a little more from my burger - it looked smashed and deformed like it was in the bottom of a pile. I guess the only saving grace were the tater tots...
__label__2	"Foods are not authentic.  The chef is Vietnamese for Japanese foods.  Foods are a little too salty because of the soy sauce.  Foods are a little pricy.

Restaurant's atmosphere is ok.  The waitresses are friendly.  My family and I may not come back to this restaurant again."
__label__2	it's just okay. i have been here a couple of times and never been wowed and it seems a little over priced.
__label__2	"Service has been consistently terrible every time I've been here. Blatantly ignoring patrons seems to be common practice amongst the staff. They will make eye contact with you and not refill your glass for the better part of your meal, and some seem to have an attitude problem. 
It's normally overcrowded and extremely noisy, not to mention extremely difficult to get into. The food is okay, but not worth the price-- and definitely not worth the frustration. Save your money."
__label__2	"I thought the black bean quesadilla was going to actually be individual black beans in there. It's actually has a black bean burger in there. They should really specify that what it is. I would have never gotten it. I don't like black bean burgers because they have soy in them. I would not go there again especially not paying $9.63 for something not even ""homemade."""
__label__2	A thumbs down on the Stanley Breakfast Special - scrambled eggs from a box that we're rubbery and cold, bacon was greasy and undercooked, toast (one piece mind you), was soft, and potatoes were just OK.  Pass on that item, sorry won't risk trying other items, when I know NOLA has soooo... many other options for the same $ - Guest Check ~ $40 for two of these so called specials.  I will only give two stars for the service.  Try Croissant D'or on Ursuline for much better option...
__label__2	"I hate giving a negative review because all of the staff were so friendly and helpful. They were so great that I left a large tip before seeing the job on the car. I got the 24.95 interior and exterior wash. The exterior looked good as did parts of the interior but I was shocked at the level of grit still in the car. I couldn't stay and ask for a re-do because my six year old daughter was getting antsy and hungry.

See pics below."
__label__2	Does not make shrimp fried rice correctly. If you ask them to make it with eggs they want to charge you more. Customer service sucks
__label__2	"I live within 1/4 mile but never knew about this place until 5/17/2021. 

I ordered the medium American Wagyu Cheese Steak $12.29.   It didn't wow me as there seemed to be too much salt and unsure if it was the cheese or the cook.  Maybe it was the pickles but for sure the steak was over salted.  

Not sure either if the Wagyu made a difference and I wasn't a fan of the roll either.  

Jury is still out if I'll be back."
__label__2	Very good work and beautiful decor. However, I've attempted to make appointments and was told that they don't take appointments. Then one week later returned to do a walk-in and was told needed to have an appoint and that they were booked for the next two days.
__label__2	Short but sweet.  Been to Phat Bites three times food is really pretty good, but service sucks.  Staff is disorganized and rude.  Takes forever to get orders and every time we were missing our side orders.  Will not go back
__label__2	Fast and efficient. The burgers are an imitation of White Castle.
__label__2	We went to Thai Basil and got seated right away and after 15 minutes , we still did not have water or had anyone even make eye contact with us.  Terrible Service!   We left.
__label__2	Good bc they stay open late but horrible service any time of day! Very racist & don't think ur getting a seat after 11 on a weekend.
__label__2	I ordered a Philly Cheesesteak on French today.I paid $13 ($2 was tip). The bread had probably been microwaved, the meat was minuscule, barely any cheese, an all around expensive abomination. On the other hand, once I ordered the turkey dinner special and it was great. I won't be going there any more. Extremely inconsistent and a crapshoot
__label__2	I would give it 3.5 but rounded it off to 4. Great burger.. totally blew our order. Asked for the 3 cheese ravioli, they sent us 3 cheese raviolis. three orders. Asked for Merguez, got 2 orders of charcuteries. I had to pay for it. Actually, i just relived my annoyance, so ill give it 2 stars. Because the burger was good..
__label__2	Restaurant was super noisy. We had to shout across the table. I had the BBQ pork po'boy and the bread was so hard I cut my lip on it. Mac n' cheese was good.
__label__2	"This place was recommended by the hotel.
Service was sub par on Monday.  I had to ask 3 others that weren't my server for the check.
It was sadly funny to see a half cup of risotto spread across the plate in a thin layer.   
He didn't check on me other than to present the check, finally...
Disappointing over all experience."
__label__2	"They are extremely understaffed and are very unapologetic about their long wait time. Twice have they estimated a ""15 min."" waiting time only to have us wait for over 45 min. to the point that we had to leave because the metered parking doesn't allow for more than an hour of parking. They do an ok job for the price but with all other things considered it's definitely not worth it."
__label__2	Ordered take out, not great. Soggy. Seems like the Mac and cheese comes out if a bag.
__label__2	The WORST organization of any deli I've ever been to. They have no idea how to take orders and make them in a timely fashion. Old guy just sits in the back doing nothing to help out. For mediocre sandwiches, that's not good. Great beer selection though. So maybe get drunk beforehand and lose track of time.
__label__2	"ordered 40 wings, got 36, not really hot, mushy and not crisp, very little sauce!!  last time I order from them, Goody's has much better value and taste and more meat even though smaller at Goody's and as for ""Famous Award Winning Wings,"" lost that title!!!!"
__label__2	"Nothing stays the same and that's not always a good thing. 
The cases are dirty and that's a big red flag. Years and years of shopping here and patronizing this Bakery sadly I think time to move on even though as much as I want to support independents , someplace like this pushes me away ...
i always put up with crazy street parking on 5 th, but its getting old..."
__label__2	"They didn't put napkins in my togo food, also my food was supposed to come with salad but didn't.
Also they claim they're serious about covid to the point that you can't even wait inside for the food but the cashier lady started cutting apple without washing her hand right after putting the orders and touch the tablet that every customer touches to pay."
__label__2	This is a very convenient location. 24 hours and right off the interstate should make for a great spot but this spot is plagued by long drive through lines and inefficient staff. Add to that the issue with backup onto the road and it makes for a bad experience. The coffee, once finally received is usually pretty tasty but they are lucky no competition has moved in here.
__label__2	For such a highly rated restaurant I was not pleased with the food. The fries that came with the torta were bland. My nachos were soggy, lacking beans and something I could make a home. I came in with high expectations.
__label__2	This is my third attempted using a Jeep dealer for maintenance and service of my 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee. The first two visits were ok better than some other locations. Overall I'm so unhappy with my Jeep and the service I receive at these local dealerships I decided to trade it in for a Acura.
__label__2	"We were very quickly brought a hot, fresh basket of chips and delicious salsa.  Our waiter came over to greet us and get a beverage order.  After he brought our beverages, he went and sat down and visited with a friend who was eating.  It took him quite awhile to come back.  The food was decent, not spectacular.  Unfortunately, the place is absolutely filthy.  There was dried salsa on the backs of chairs.  The silk flowers were disgustingly covered in thick laers of dust.  
The restaurant used to be better and has totally gone downhill.  I know we won't be going back."
__label__2	Pastries are good but the costumer service here is very poor thus making our experience in enjoyable.
__label__2	Not to impressed with place.  If your going out for drinks it's a good place but the food isn't all that great.  It's over priced and not very enjoyable. Also if you are going out for a family dinner and children will be with you, you better brace yourself for some dirty looks.
__label__2	Not impressed by the burgers at all. Taste and texture was off. Place looks like a great place for breakfast though.
__label__2	"My waiter was very rude he seemed to be very new and not know the preseizure of how things normally run. He did not grant what was advertised on the menu. He told me i would have to pay for an additional salad when it was supposed to be ""unlimited""."
__label__2	Edible but Taco Bell actually has more flavor. I've given this place two tries. Both times a fail. The chips and salsa are OK so this place might be more suitable for sticking to that and drinks at happy hour. Sigh.... and it feels like you're in the Mexican section at Epcot inside. Strange and OTT for no reason.
__label__2	Service sux, I asked for don Julio n instead of telling me they don't have it what else would you like.. No they just gave me what they wanted too....Horrible service :-( disappointed
__label__2	"Same problem with this place as I have with Costco...people waddling around looking for freaking snacks.  Just shop gotdamnit!
Don't stare longingly into the empty bowls willing a piece of cheese to appear - move along Tons o Fun! I need some gd produce!

GAH!!"
__label__2	Poor service and watery/bland clam chowder. Had to ask for a high chair (1 year old in our party), ask for refills on water and hot tea, and later refill on our sweet tea. Also had to ask for our check.  My tea came out with plain hot water one time w tea bag on the side, and then already steeped the second time with tea bag on the side. Not sure what to make of that.
__label__2	Just don't get how this place is still in business.  I've been a couple of times and each time we've waited a couple of years in between visits just to see if any improvements or something tasty.  You're spending most of your time waiting - waiting to be seated, waiting to take your order, waiting to get your food, waiting to get your drinks refilled and to top it off the food is subpar.  The BBQ is nothing to brag about and I'd recommend just staying in and making your own!
__label__2	"This place has a lot of equipment, which is the only plus about these clubs. I've seen over weight people being talked down to by trainers, heard horror stories and have personally been swindled by the sales staff. 
Also a lot of gyms don't charge activation fees. This place may have a lot of equipment, but being in this environment is not worth it."
__label__2	Red Lobster restaurants tend to be OK, but this one was less OK than others, with a service culture that could use an upgrade.
__label__2	The wings were good but the service was terrible. We were sat down and then the waitress didn't come get our drink orders for 15 min then she brought those back after another 10 min and after she brought our food she didn't come back the rest of the night. I had to pull a different waiter over to get a drink refill. The male server was very nice
__label__2	The food here is delicious but unfortunately the service at this location is awful everytime. I'm not talking long lines and order errors but just basic customer service. Everyone is always so rude and impatient even though there are usually 15+ people working there. I have actually stopped going here just because of the attitude. If you feel like braving the sass, I recommend the Butter Burger and fresh banana shakes. The flavored fries seem fun but have a distinct chemical taste.
__label__2	"Positives:
-great patio located right on State Street
-reasonably priced
-nice ambience
-decent food

Negatives:
-very poor customer service that completely overwhelmed the positives. Hope this was a one-time exception but would not go back."
__label__2	Kind of cool atmosphere, but service was lame.  Tampa needs a new steakhouse. All the old s#$ts can lay around and wait for their food at this flophouse. Good luck boys.
__label__2	Stevens needs a serious revamp. They definitely have potential but man was this food awful. The menu was even worse. They had a weird combo of chicken parm and then crab cakes? Are we doing seafood or Italian? I ordered the Cesar salad because there was nothing else on the menu I wanted. The salad was drenched and soggy. And it was so tiny! I got a side of asparagus and it just tasted worse. I will not be dining here again unfortunately. I wish they would do something about the food because YUCK
__label__2	It was a good experience until I realized the chef had a hair lose problem. Additionally, the place was dusty and disorganized. The food was actually very tasty. This place needs something me changes!
__label__2	I visited this Starbucks on 9-3-2013 and don't think I would recommend it to anyone else.  The tables were dirty. The windows hadn't been cleaned and there were dead flies on the window sill.  Not a good first impression.
__label__2	Not a fan, surprisingly, especially since I used to be a huge fan of Fogo de Chao (Fogo!). Went for dinner around the holiday season, food is good but not THAT good to justify more than $100 for just two adults (and we didn't even order wine). Service was ok. However, the worse part is that we had to make a dash for the restroom within an hour of dinning at this location, prime suspect is the smoked salmon. If you are craving for meats galore, maybe give it a try, otherwise steer clear of this location.
__label__2	Slow and overpriced! The staff was more concerned about their own conversation than customer needs
__label__2	Cozy place with a very friendly staff. However the food was mediocre, and the prices were extravagant.
__label__2	Food and service were fine.  This was our first visit to Justine's.  Unfortunately, the music provided by a DJ was so loud that normal conversation was extremely difficult.  After asking 3 times, the volume was toned down.  The experience would be much better if there was no DJ.  It added nothing to the dinner
__label__2	Seems that they did something about the noise level by driving away their customers.
__label__2	I bought a Porsche Boxter and had it shipped. When it arrived, it didn't have  air conditioned seats, a feature that was pushed as a major selling point. I told the salesman and got no reply. It was too much hassle to try to ship back but I was disappointed that the car did not match the description.
__label__2	10% gratuity fee for picking up a to go order? And they didn't even help me carry the bags out?  A little unreasonable on a $250 tab. The food was okay. I'm sticking with my usual Los Agaves, delicious and reasonable prices.
__label__2	"Food is good.
DO NOT order on line.  Did this twice and both times they forgot to make the order.  I waited 40 minutes for my order when I arrived."
__label__2	Good Cuban sandwiches, but it took 45 min (were told twenty min) to get the order (take-out) and half of what we ordered wasn't even given to us. So disappointed in the wait and not getting our full order!
__label__2	The atmosphere is the redeeming quality of this place. Food is standard, there are many better options in Nashville right now. Drinks were fine and the happy hour is a good deal.
__label__2	"The food is great! The service is good. Prices are wonderful! 
There is no changing table in the bathroom! I have an infant that wears diapers. I had to change him yesterday (10/22/15) while at this restaurant but there was no changing table. I, unfortunately, had to use my son's blanket and put him on the FLOOR to change his diaper! My children and they're health are very important to me. I'd have given maybe 4 stars but that brought it down!"
__label__2	The food was great and the service was great, BUT there are flies EVERYWHERE. They harassed us the entire time we ate inside.
__label__2	Mobile orders not ready on time. Tried it for the first time and my order was not ready at the 12:45 pickup time. I stood there til almost 1:00 asking what the delay was as I had only ordered one burrito and chips with queso. Employees are nice but it would have been faster going through the line as everyone who was in line were already seated enjoying their meal. Pickup ordering is a fail!
__label__2	I got dip nails and it was probably the worst dip I've ever gotten. They made it so thick and uneven. Terrible. And I paid 50 dollars for it. Never going back.
__label__2	I was so excited when coming in to see the sign that said, mask required, you won't be seated without them, and after we were seated, a table of for his were seated with NO MASKS!!!  If you are not going to enforce your own rules, what good are they, take the sign down then!!!
__label__2	went here on a whim to check out something new. The food was OK and the worst part it was over priced. I have had better and paid less at other places and the food was ten times better. Don't suggest you go here unless you were like we were and thought to just try it.
__label__2	I ordered an XL Chicken Bacon Ranch pizza for delivery and I'm so disappointed. I always order delivery from this Dominos location and I've never had an issue but I just payed $27 plus a $4 tip for a pizza with barely any toppings on it. There's more cheese than anything and on top of that the pizza was barely warm. Not a happy customer.
__label__2	Really not a big fan of this place. The location is fine with plenty of parking. The atmosphere is obviously chain restaurant and just okay. The rolls are by far the best part of coming here as they are delicious and the cinnamon butter that comes with them is pretty darn incredible. The food itself though is really bland and not very good. Their margaritas and cocktails are pretty much junk. The service the last two times I went was really pretty poor. I think they spread their waitresses a little too thin. Overall I really think there are so many better places to go in the area than texas roadhouse.
__label__2	Sorry, Lazy Acres, you don't deserve to be called a Natural Foods Store when you put sugar in EVERYTHING. The beans in the deli have added sugar, the spinach strawberry salad has added sugar, the tomatoes and cucumbers at the salad bar have added sugar. STOP, ALREADY!
__label__2	This place was by far extremely disappointing. There is nothing famous about this place. The brisket was gray & fatty. Not a good fatty, but a chewy fatty. The server was ok, but the manager was very accommodating. If I ever go back it would be a surprise to me. It's time to take the famous off & just call yourself Dave's.
__label__2	"Only apple store around this area. The wait time isn't bad and the place is well maintained. But the service is very bad. They denied my charger's replacement even if it was under warranty claiming that it was not ""normal use"". They couldn't even speak to their claim. Apple acknowledged that the chargers will wear at certain points in their support website. The employees here were nothing but just ignorant"
__label__2	Nice view of the garden district, and cemetery, but the coffee wasn't so great. The coffee is honestly hard to drink without sugar, and although the food was good it's a COFFEE SHOP. I wouldn't recommend coming here.
__label__2	The Wendys in Irvine and RSM are a lot better quality than this location. I like the 4 for 4 deal but this wendys has given me krusty nuggets that are hard to chew, and soggy cold fries. The Junior Bacon burger was good except the tomato didn't look right, it wasn't red and juicy- it was a gross kinda gross so i pulled it out. I also ordered an apple pecan salad at a different time at this location and it was okay.
__label__2	Nice looking little pizzas that taste like airport food. No flavor. The tomato sauce comes from plastic bags that the cooks open to reheat.
__label__2	Why is that ridiculous fire alarm twittering? It's been making that awful sound for over a year?! Weird and unwelcoming. But...doesn't really matter because whenever I go in there, there are literally almost no tops in Large size?  The rack is nearly empty. And was also when I went in a month ago. I don't get it.
__label__2	Manayunk in fishtown - if you could bottle the scent that is manayunk and put it into a bottle in fishtown - you have Garage Fishtown
__label__2	Hawaiian poke this is not. Knowing that the poke craze is slowly making its way across the mainland,  I was hopeful to see a place offering poke bowls. The fish, while fresh, sits naked until you decide which sauce you want, leaving the fish a bit tasteless and bland. The toppings offered are quite good, although a bit non-traditional. In short, what you get is a haole version of poke.
__label__2	Why is it the more money you spend for a product, the less customer service is offered? If I wanted a headset, five people swarm to make sure I didn't pocket the thing. Buying a TV? You could swing a dead cat over your head while reciting the Pledge of Allegience.
__label__2	The food is fantastic but service is so hit or miss.   It's unbearable.   Sometimes free bread sometimes NOT.   Refills ah No.   and then the dogs on the patio seriously this is not Europe keep your dogs at home.    It's a meal.   One meal that you drove to leave the mutt at home.
__label__2	Stopped by at 11:00 am this Sunday and the place was locked up tight. I really hope they get their hours straight otherwise this place will not be open for long. Sad Face.
__label__2	Pretentious and full of themselves.  Did not enjoy the vibe one bit.  Server could not get the order right after 2 attempts.  How difficult is it to make a dirty martini?!  My guest wanted a hot beverage.  They couldnt comply with that request.  He then requested a liquor instead.  They only had their own curated  available, no Frangelica or Amaretto to be had.  Cost was exorbitant, based on quality.  This one won't last in a creative city that knows how to entertain.
__label__2	Really cool vibes and cute place, drinks and the atmosphere were the only things that make this place two stars. Our waitress was really nice and attentive as well. As far as food, I ordered the eggs Benedict and it was cold and the poached eggs were close to raw. My friend ordered the steak sandwich and it looked like it had been sitting out for a couple of hours. Both of our meals were cold and not good at all. My other friends enjoyed their falafel, egg and cheese sandwich, and the grilled cheese. I would not suggest anyone to come here.
__label__2	Dunkin Donuts isn't my favorite but I like the munchkins and that's what gets me to come every once in awhile. It's in a kind of crappy location which makes it hard to turn in and out of and there isn't exactly a ton of parking. The employees are always nice and prompt though.
__label__2	The view of the ballpark is amazing!  However, for what we paid for the room the space is small and the bathroom is incredibly small and annoying. I felt like I had to organize while on vacation so that I had room in the room. Our room had a wet area on the floor when we checked in. We managed to dry it out but also noticed a smell. A bad smell. Overall loved the location and view but it doesn't feel Hilton quality inside the room.
__label__2	So, did this really happen? Went inside the restaurant because the drive thru was becoming bumper to bumpee with cars. I was not in the mood so decided to walk up and order at the register. I waited my turn to get my order taken and the girl behind the register didnt even ask if I was ready to order as I was standing there. She took the guy standing next to me. Message received Magnolia McDonald's. It's called customer courtesy.
__label__2	Either they have the smoothest vodka I've ever tasted or the bartender forgot to add any to our drinks. Pretty sure it was the latter. With so many great bars on Mass Ave we won't be back here anytime soon.
__label__2	"1st visit was great, 2nd not so much. I had the ""famous"" bake & it was not good too much cream not enough flavor in the sauce, they do have excellent raw oysters (I.e. The 2 stars)"
__label__2	Been there several times service is always slow and inattentive. Improve your service please you're not worth it based on food quality.
__label__2	"If you're in the Frenchman St. area for drinks/dinner/music, you can pop in here for a bit. It's really small so browsing took only a few minutes.

For those that are from small towns, this may seem really cool and cute but if you're from a city, then it will remind you of any other flea. The decor is nice with a lot of lights strung up around the entire lot and some funky art hanging including old instruments like trumpets and sax. None of the art or jewelry caught my eye but it's a nice change of scenery from Bourbon St."
__label__2	"Cute place, great water pressure, spacious rooms, decent pool. However, our air conditioning unit could just NOT cool our room down, it
never went below 77 degrees. Totally uncomfortable. Also, windows in second floor rooms don't have screens (!) so having them open was a no-go with kids."
__label__2	Terrible customer service and there was only one person working! Super slow and need workers that know how to speak English. Do not recommend going to this location.
__label__2	Make sure you get a price before hand. Confirm with the nail tech what you are getting.
__label__2	Was my favorite location until I found a hair in my half empty cup of mountain dew. I have dreads it wasn't mine. Gave 2 stars because it was my only bad experience. Never had a problem until this incident. And to the lady who commented saying they don't sell mountain dew. They definitely do in Langhorne, Pa so before you comment check your facts.
__label__2	Mediocre. Food is mostly okay, I guess. Could be better selection. Some seedy looking clientele frequent the place, though, for some reason, a dingy looking white station wagon is at times parked near the restaurant, which is the old Gourdo's restaurant in the rear of the shopping plaza. I would not go out of my way to go there.
__label__2	"I went to lunch there yesterday 1/21/18 and ordered a polish kielbasa sandwich on bun and a side order of onion tanglers. One of the staff had a hard time remembering the order before me. 
When I got home no onion tanglers and out $2.50.
The main problem I have is the food always seems greasy. I don't know if it's the butter on the bun or the meat. 
The meat must be smoked somewhere else because when they open the warmer the meat is wrapped.
Despite this the food is pretty good."
__label__2	Not impressed with the cost or size of the personal pizza gluten free. 1 small and 1 personal pizza cost me nearly $40.
__label__2	Pretty terrible Thai food. I'm normally a huge fan of panang curry, and their version is like a peanut slop. Nearly inedible. Recommend Long Chim NOLA on Magazine instead.
__label__2	Not that special. I've had a whole lot better. I think the tourist trap of downtown Nashville is not for me. I prefer more authentic places, whether it's a hole-in-the-wall country store with great BBQ or random pop up. Fact is, this place lacked a lot. My ribs were from the day before with bones as flexible as straws, the meat was dry and stale. I'll pass on this meat and three tourist trap.
__label__2	"My 8 yo granddaughter gave our dinner tonight a 5 out of 10 because her lemonade was ""disgusting"" which I agreed with because it was made from a powder mix. I really expect better in this price range   And she wasn't impressed with her meatball, also agreed. The pasta in my spinach lasagna was over cooked and there was a layer of water under the sauce. I specifically picked a alcoholic drink without orange in it only to find one smashed at the bottom of the glass. The quality has really gone down, I won't be back."
__label__2	"Smoking bar. Extremely loud!! Food is very average. If you like Biker Bars, you'll love this one.
Place has turned over several times."
__label__2	Last time I went in, I had Lee and he was amazing and gave 5 stars on my review. This time I asked for Lee but got Lucy instead. She was not very friendly at all, and my nails look terrible. I recommend Lee 100%, but Lucy not so much. My nails have so many air bubbles in them and they are nothing like what I asked for.
__label__2	We had a celebration dinner with a large party so planned ahead by making a reservation.  Everyone was there on time but we were told that there would still be a 20 minute wait.  The wait ended up being over an hour. So much for reservations.  Once seated, another 15 minute wait before anyone came to our table. Everyone was quite hungry by then so we ordered a couple of blooming onions for the table and drinks.  By the time the appetizers were delivered, we had been at the restaurant for 2 hours!  The food was good (and accurate) but the service was disappointing this visit.
__label__2	Ordered meatball heroes and they were mediocre at best, definitely not fresh tasting and the cheese wasn't melted enough, just a big glob on top of the meatballs.  Bread was good, but that's about it.  Food is overpriced for the quality received.
__label__2	"The old days of simple casino coffee shops is past. We stopped by here to have a simple breakfast, it was closed ""to make improvements"" and were directed upstairs to another restaurant serving breakfast in its place. It was good but not worth $85 for three basic bacon and eggs breakfasts with drinks. The Peppermill is the best resort in Reno but you're now paying Vegas strip prices. If you want Steak and Eggs for $7.99 better head downtown."
__label__2	"Very rude employee named Moe waited on me when I asked why he was so rude he said go somewhere else if I didn't like it. I've spent a few hundred dollars at this store over the last couple months so as I finish my project one thing is for sure I will take Moe's advice and spend my money at Auto Zone or other stores..... Moe needs a customer service update.
Business goes where it is welcome!!"
__label__2	Really pretty terrible food. Great diner ambience but worst omelette ever. Nothing fresh. Just dumped bad salsa on eggs and called it a Spanish omelet.
__label__2	"TOURIST TRAP FOR OUT OF TOWNERS

The roast pork sandwich is over rated, a bit dry, flavorless, and expensive.  Just because it's been on the Food Network doesn't mean it's good!

If you want a good sandwich, go to Paesano's or John's Roast Pork."
__label__2	"Not what I was expecting. Start with the good. Seemed like a nice interior with a nice staff. The sauce was good. Otherwise, this is one of those places that sell 'fancy' pizza that is not meant for takeout (which is what I did after hearing all of the good reviews). The crust was too thin, toppings too few; it was supposed to be a 14"" pie that came out looking like a large, flat personal pie for $17.00.  Unlikely to try this place again."
__label__2	"Food quality below standard. We ordered chicken fried steak, seafood pasta, chicken wings. Chicken fried steak- the meat was dry, gravy helped. Chicken wings were extremely dry. Seafood pasta tasted so weird, not sure if the weird taste came from the salmon, the sauce or the pasta, I bet the salmon/sauce, we threw it away. 
The people are quite polite, otherwise I would have given this place 1 star."
__label__2	Visited here August 1st at the recommendation from our hotel concierge (The Ritz). Very disappointed.  It is nothing more than a high priced pork place. Yes there are things that are somewhat unique but nothing extraordinary-Alligator bites were delicious. The beef short rib was fatty, the pork patty was dried shredded pork formed into a patty, their signature made in-house bacon was so chewy and tough you could barely chew it.  Maybe because we are from Dallas where it is very foodie, but this place is not worth your time or money.  Visit a tried and true NOLA establishment.
__label__2	Ordered a coconut mijito and it was the best drink and only good thing from this visit. Sushi wasn't that great, the sweet and sour chicken tasted like it was in the fridge too long as well as having a plastic after taste. We also were served a nasty spoon with food stuck on it. I will not return.
__label__2	Place is busy and not much parking. Parking lot had huge potholes more like craters. Food is ok. Chicken wings were dry but sauce was good. Don't think it's my type of place.
__label__2	"Really, not the kind of quality I was looking for. People were nice but, just no. Family got up and left. Went to Wawa insted. Like the 2 stars recommendation says, ""Meh. I've experienced better."""
__label__2	I stopped by just to try the pizza. Service is slow, nobody was there.  The pepperoni slice had four pieces of pepperoni.  $3.20.  Seems like a lot.  It was ok pizza.
__label__2	"This airport is in dire need of upgrades.  No matter which concourse you go to the security line moves as though everyone is getting a personal TSA touch.  It's a travesty when you compare it to other airports.  They need to improve the signage around the airport inside.  My first few times there I had to hunt for the Continental/United check in.

A  few more eatery options post security would be a good start.  Most flights leaving from MSY on star alliance carriers with the exception of Houston are 2 or more hours in duration."
__label__2	"Was excited to try this place with all the high reviews, but bad experience overall. The parking lot was a clusterfuck and the machine didn't have any paper for a voucher. Not their problem but a sign indicating that we wouldn't be booted would have saved us 10 minutes of confusion. 

Coffee was decent but service was poor. Waited 15 minutes for two pastries which they forgot to give us and nobody bothered to ask what we were standing there waiting for for so long. And the pastries were bunk."
__label__2	"It's only ""okay."" Cinnamon buns and cannolis taste a few days old. Workers are friendly, but food isn't the greatest."
__label__2	The service here is very inconsistent. Last night it was about nil. So many options, so many questions and it was at least half an hour before anyone was available to help or rather I could find to help. The cashiers looked aggravated and unapproachable. I'd probably go to the individual counters at canal place versus coming back here; you get what you pay for.
__label__2	Food was very lackluster. Service was really good, Justice was our server. We expected more. This restaurant is a couple steps below Olive Garden.
__label__2	Disappointing. 3 for dinner. All 3 orders came out cold. 2 NY strips and a sea bass. Had to send them back.  And this was a Tuesday. Sheldon, waiter was fine but something is wrong behind the curtain
__label__2	Management and employees are essentially non-existent. Asked for manager and was told she was in a meeting. Store was FREEZING cold, it must have been 40 degrees in there. Ravitz you cheap ass-install some overhead door heaters (air curtains). Ravitz certainly doesn't run SR like the Zallie's-that's for sure.
__label__2	"Alesha had no interest in customers or taking their orders, both times I repeated the same menu item. Nothing custom, just a sandwich and hash browns. She brought her 3 elementary age kids to work, which sat in the lobby (no other adult around), so that may have distracted her. The girl at expo looked off in the distance and was expressionless. She didn't say a word. $15/hr would fix her mood. Please...
I gave a score of 2 solely due to food quality and cost.
Columbus/Dale Mabry managers would not allow this disconnected demeanor."
__label__2	Leaves a lot to be desired. Our waitress was great, checking up on us every few minutes but the food was extremely mediocre. The homefries were dry, bacon was flavorless, etc. The only good thing was the blueberry pancakes, they were great and filling.
__label__2	Mediocre donut and coffee that will burn your tongue off your face. Poor communication amongst workers so that you will likely end up with the wrong donut.
__label__2	I got here just after happy hour and ordered two tacos. The Al Pastor Taco and the Bistec Tacos. Neither of them were good. They were ok at best. The mango mojito was fine but their regular mojito wasn't good. I honestly don't know why this restaurant has such good reviews. If you want really good Mexican food go to the Italian market. I would give this place 2.5 stars.
__label__2	Not bad. Just not all that great. It did its job. Will i go back. Ehh.. Doubt it.
__label__2	"I have no idea why i thought eating food at a place like this would be a good idea. I'd complain about how bad the burger and tacos were but I guess that's just the type of place it is.

Go here if you like dark bars that blast shitty pop music. Why was the music so loud early in the night when the place was empty?"
__label__2	Vegetarians: skip it. Unless you are pescetarian there is only salad or kid's Mac n cheese. I'm sure the seafood is good, but we had to leave after our drinks as we weren't able to find anything to eat on he menu. Nice decor, they were all decorated for Halloween, and the waitress was awesome. She was super understanding, shared her own similar story and recommended some other places to try. Then she only charged us for a beer even though all 3 of us had gotten drinks! Check it out if you want seafood :)
__label__2	These people need to learn how to give you a tad more alcohol in their sugary drinks.
__label__2	I haven't actually seen Dr. Garrett in years. Not since she opened the medical spa next door. Instead, I see the nurse practitioner. She's great, but she isn't the doctor I signed up for.
__label__2	"They must have lost their chef.....the last two times we were disappointed in the quality of their dishes.......likely not go back.




Do not let the name nor the location fool you.  Its doesn't have great curb appeal.  However, the food is EXCELLENT!  its the best we have ever tasted, even better than the San Francisco Bay Area Thai restaurants.  I highly recommend this place.  We have been there three times and tried six different plates....all impressed us!

Nice wait staff and a real Thai woman cooks the food!

Awesome!"
__label__2	Migas were only ok. Bananas Foster French toast was not as good as expected. Kids got Banana pancakes that they did not like. I also don't recommend taking children under 3. The place is more of a young adults only kind of place in my opinion.
__label__2	Grabbed the fish and chips after a late flight and can ride in. Crispy beer battered fish, good chunks of meat, but lots of dough and it was a bit too mushy for my taste. Comes with your standard fries, McDonald's-ish tartar sauce and fresh slaw.
__label__2	Big, open and clean like any other airport (except Las Vegas' McCarren International). TSA is not known for being the friendliest nation-wide, but people of color just might notice that they are talked down to and treated like trash noticeably more. Not sure what the TSA (which is mostly people of color also) is trying to prove or to whom they are trying to show for, but It's disgusting performative behavior. Signed sincerely, a black girl looking out.
__label__2	Food took 40 minutes to come out, during which time, all 6 people at the table had finished their drinks. Someone other than our server threw our food on the table and we all had to eat lunch without drinks. I ordered my burger medium rare, but it came out charred and well done. The fries were perfect, so there was one positive. 30 minutes later, our server threw the check on the table and left.
__label__2	Nothing special, with an extremely long wait. The shrimp and grits was awful. No flavor and full of oil. My only suggestion would be the crab pasta, extremely rich and fattening, but super.
__label__2	False advertising - they advertised all you can eat sushi on their web page.  We chose to eat there based on this.  When we ordered they claimed the all you can eat was weekend only and even though I showed the manager the web site they denied us.  I stated it was false advertising and manager was rude and stated it doesn't state when therefore - no!  We are locals and eat out often and my sushi loving son said he would never eat there again.
__label__2	Least favorite pho in town. Won't be back. It was so bland. The service was very good though. I went to my favorite spot twice today....999 but it was packed both times. There was at least 20 people waiting both times. There is a reason, it is the best in town. I thought I would give this place a try. I did not enjoy it at all. I should have gone with my backups... Golden Flower or The ElDo.
__label__2	Way too much cheese!!! Think they are confused about who they are. When I walked in all the specials were Mexican. Then they had a new menu item listed that was a gyro. Hadn't been here in a long time and boy has it changed. A few tables to sit at and that's it.  Won't be back
__label__2	I was so excited to go there ... the menu looked fantastic.. went and had the pork sandwich.. to me the bread was overwhelming... and when i asked for some hot sauce was told i would have to pay .. wow ..potatotes were tasty... i guess i should have tried the platter . it looked pretty darn good... however i dont know if i will go back as i was very disappointed in my first meal.. must say the staff were pleasant
__label__2	"The restaurant is always under staffed for some reason. The food is bland and too saucy with pasta. They have the 2 for special. The portions are smaller and very unattractively served on plates. Stay away from the spinach appetizer with tortilla chips. The chips taste like frying oil. I had them and should have sent them back. I felt bad for my server that had too many tables for her skill level. Just another attempt by corporations to get people in restaurants and jack up the final check with add ons.
Horrible food not worth price paid."
__label__2	"I want to like this place. I really do. I love the idea of being able to get my hair blown-out in a cute setting for a set price. (No upcharges for using a curling iron, etc.) 

But my two visits here have been just okay. Both times they made my hair more wavy than curly, which was not what I requested, and both times my hair was flat before I got to my events. (And yes my hair holds a curl!) 

I think the price is a little too steep too, especially for a blowout that lasts just 2 hours."
__label__2	"I was really going to this place a 4 or 5 star. The ambience was good. Our server was great. Food looked appealing too. However, as soon I got in the car to drive back home. I started feeling sick. Sure enough as soon as i got home i started throwing out. I believe it was one of the tapas we ordered that wasnt cooked thoroughly & tasted kind of raw.
The only reason I can think of. But, it was a painful night at home after dinner!!"
__label__2	Pharmacy waiting room was filthy! Trash, crushed bits of food, and cobwebs all over the floor and baseboards. I had time to notice this when I waited--a while--for my medications. Blaring holiday music made things even worse. Ewww.
__label__2	"Over priced Pho noodle soup. 
Went there for lunch with a friend. Ordered beef Pho noodle soup. It showed up with rice noodle, some veggie and 6 thin slices of beef in about 1.5 inch square. The broth was ok, the beef was well well done with a few slice of onion floating around before I dumped in the bean sprout and basil. The bill came in a little over $10 including tax is a ripoff even in the suburb. The service was fast and that's the only good part for my lunch. Got to find some place better."
__label__2	"Very friendly people, adding a star for how great they seem to be!

Tom kha gai, spring rolls, pad ped, all OK but not especially good, and very expensive ($12, $6, $15) for small portions and quality. 

Don't go if you're from somewhere with good Thai food, otherwise stop by for the nice ambiance and people!

(Comparing to ~10 SF Thai places, so may be unfair for Reno, but current rating is misleading)"
__label__2	Food is barely above cafeteria quality food. Can do without the passive-aggressive bartender, too. Won't be back.
__label__2	Food was good but over priced. Also the workers working the counter could not care any less about the customer. When taking my order the guy seemed annoyed and didn't say anything to me. When it was time to pay he just tapped the register instead of using his words. I speak Spanish and English so they were just being rude to be rude.
__label__2	"Someone posted that the dishes were small and I should have paid more attention. When you order the second most expensive item on the menu (chirashizushi $18) and you get a bowl full of rice and 8 pieces small pieces of  fish hidden underneath. You you wonder if you ordered Sashimi or rice. I would definitely avoid unless you are desperate for an expensive bowl of sticky rice. 
I was completely misled by the previous reviews. I ended up going for ice cream next door (much better!)."
__label__2	When they first opened, the prices never bothered me because of the quality of the food. Now that they are established, the quality has not been very good so my family and I take the drive to Tarpon instead... And it's not that much more for impeccable food.
__label__2	Cheap yes and you get what you pay for .... Half the tvs on the machines don't work but they don't put signs on them and the definitely don't fix them.  Also if you listen to their piped in music expect the staff to change it right in the middle of songs - they pick and choose what they like.  Management needs to get their act together.
__label__2	I'm not sure what i was expecting, but this wasn't it. It is a concert venue with a few random tables and a bar in the middle. The menu was overly ambitious and the food was terrible. The waitress forgot half of our meal and brought it out when we finished the rest of our food. The beer selection was better than most bars, but seriously lacking given it's 'pourhouse' name. I give it one star for taking over a vacant spot in University City and one star for having half-decent beer selection.
__label__2	"This is just your average, run of the mill, bar/restaurant.  I've never had a bad experience and been there three times.  I've had a burger, wings and pizza and none left me craving them another time, but the location is good for me, food is definitely fresh, it's always clean and the staff is always attentive.  Great amount of TV's and a pretty versatile menu make it a go-to spot on Sunday's!

I'll definitely be back but hardly see it ever progressing to more stars....and that's okay with me!"
__label__2	After hearing everyone rave about how great their mixed drinks are, I expected to have the most amazing bloody mary of my life .. To my disappointment, not only did they not have bloody mary mix, they didn't have tomato juice with which to concoct their own. My friend had a hair in her drink, the $8 plantain appetizer we ordered for the table had 5 small pieces on it. Not impressed.
__label__2	The chicken karage is terrible... good grief do something about it because it's wrong.  I like this place place but the karage is terrible.
__label__2	It's been a while since we've been here and we don't plan on going back anytime soon. From the drinks to the food, there was nothing that stood out as something we couldn't get anywhere else. It's so disappointing when you order a steak at a restaurant and it's no good. There are far more superior steakhouses in the area to be wasting money here.
__label__2	The room we stayed in was beautiful, but the room service and slots were attrocious.  I have gambled at many casinos, but I honestly think this might have been my worst experience ever. I put several hundred dollars in and barely hit a bonus.  It was not fun at all. After continuing to put money in and losing horribly, I returned to the room to order food. They said it would be 30-35 minutes. But when all was said and done, it finally arrived over 2 hours later and was missing items and sauces. I have no desire to ever set foot in this place again.
__label__2	"The past 3 times I've been to this location, they've been ""out"" of something I've ordered. Today it was wheat buns, last time it was  all milkshakes and the time before that I think it was salad.you'd think I'd learn my lesson and go somewhere else...."
__label__2	Room was cute, but the bed and pillows were uncomfortable even after asking for extra pillows. It definitely impacted our ability to get a decent night sleep. On our last full day, we left in the morning and returned about dinner time to find our room unattended; we notified the front desk and it was resolved 2 hours later... annoying and disappointing when you just want to take a nap and relax. We will be selecting a different hotel on our next trip to Boise.
__label__2	This location has gradually gotten worse and worse over time. You cannot get counter service at this location so you if you want to eat eat you are forced to download their app to do so. Bowls never have much in them. The workers seem nice enough but always seems like it runs on a skeleton crew. That might explain why the table tops (both inside and outside) are consistently  dirty. Far from my favorite chipotle i have come across. Management needs to go back to the drawing board and turn this place around.
__label__2	Only giving this place two stars because the servers are nice .the food is inconsistent, one day it's good and one day really bad . First day food was good , second time it was terrible! The atmosphere is fun but it's the same u can find anyplace. Just don't bother . You'll be disappointed. If you do go , stick with apps. only .
__label__2	Beer selection is great, food not so much. 100% prefer the local breweries over this chain.
__label__2	Small kids will enjoy the ambiance, but unfortunately the food is mediocre, takes too long to prepare, and is way overpriced. Not likely to return there.
__label__2	Went here on a Wednesday night and wanted to get the 1/2 off sushi offered M-F. There weren't that many options for vegetarians like myself but what I got (vegetable and avocado roll) were pretty dry. My friends got real sushi with fish and they couldn't even finish there's. Its good for a cheap dinner, but only at the 1/2 price.
__label__2	If you're looking for high-end dining.....this is not it. If you want great service.....you're not getting it here. Horribly understaffed and the waitress we had was horrible. We will not be going back.
__label__2	The food is good, but the service is horrible.  You will have long waits as your table.  If got takeout and they make a mistake.  I thought I could get it replaced the next day on my way home from work, but they insisted I had to bring in their mistaken story.
__label__2	"My wife and I went to BWW after a movie and were disappointed.   We sat at the bar and the service was not good at all.  There seemed to be people who did not know what to do, while others seemed to be doing too much.  The food was alright, but nothing great.  The beer was supposed to be Stella, but it was a wheat beer.  When they ""changed"" it out and gave us another Stella, it was still not Stella."
__label__2	Terrible service even when they are slow with few customers.  The food is bland and I am not quite sure how they stay in business.  Have heard rumors that they are staffed by illegals.  I had a to go order and the waitress was too busy playing with her child to get my order in a remotely timely fashion.
__label__2	Thought it was decent at the time but I got gel polish and literally the next day it started peeling. I don't think that he was really paying attention because it was on the edges of my skin on some nails and that's why they peeled but the others were done poorly. /: And on the manicure he completely messed up my cuticles. They're worse off now.
__label__2	Called to place an order and was told they were closing early. Web listed different hours and they had four more hours that they should have been open. Had this been handled politely, I would not be writing a review, but I was treated rudely. Needless to say, I found a different florist who was happy to take my order.
__label__2	Food was just OK. First Sunday of the month is a buffet and the food is not worth going out for. Average at best and hard to justify $10 per adult. Service was pleasant and attentive.
__label__2	We were seated right next to the front door so everyone (and their screaming kids) waiting for their table were standing right next to us  our server was slower than molasses in January. I got the salmon quinoa plate and hubby got the ribeye. Food was decent.
__label__2	"08/28/2018 1:15p. Restaurant was empty save one customer. All the tables were very dirty and needed wiped down and cleaned. The counter staff were polite and efficient. 

Ordered the southwest salad. The menu did not say it had onions or shredded tortilla chips. I would have ordered without these had I known. The salad was fresh, but having to pick out the tortilla sheds and onions was annoying. Maybe the sandwiches are a better choice than the salads?"
__label__2	Steak is below average. Salmon tastes very fishy, potatoes are bland. Service is slow and made a mistake in my order. Soup (clam chowder and gumbo soups) and dessert were best part of the day - but it's hard to screw up ice cream and brownies!
__label__2	The pizza is good but a little pricey, but my main complaint is that this is the only one in 3 states we've visited that would not honor the free salad with advance check in.
__label__2	"The bread was good, but was all that I could say positively. Actually the staff were polite and kind.
The ""large"" was one of the smallest cheese steak sandwiches that I've ever had. The amount of meat way too small. It felt like they took the amount of meat from a small and spread it thinly over the larger hoagie roll. Also the meat was lacking in flavor. I've had many cheesesteaks,  I can say that without a doubt, this was the worst one I've ever had."
__label__2	We love nordstorm rack! This location is meh, Some employees are willing to help, most are not. & Pay attention when they ring you out!
__label__2	Customer service is poor.  The selection is ok, but not well organized. The bldg it self has had many power outages while if been there.....so 2 out of 5 bc environment, Customer service... The thing we got you the 2 stars is the deals that Burlington offers
__label__2	Hadn't been here in a long time. Won't go back. The only really tasty item was the avocado salad. Miso was dull. Sushi had tasteless fish. The ginger served with sushi had almost no taste.   Back to Harusame for me. Only went here because it is closer and it was snowing.
__label__2	The ambience has modern feel which is complemented by IPads for ordering at each table. I ordered a simple breakfast: coffee and a seasonal fruit plate. The coffee arrived barely hot with no spoon and half & half because the restaurant doesn't have milk of any kind. That's hard to believe. The fruit plate didn't come with bananas (as featured in the picture). The fruit was sour so I ate 20% of it. During my 25-30 minute, not one server checked on me. Cool concept but the impersonal service and food left me searching for alternative.
__label__2	We have been here 3 times and each time the temperature of the dining room was frigid. As for as the food, it's ok. A little problem with today's meal. The waitress told us about the BBQ chicken special. She neglected to say it was a pulled chicken sandwich. It was not chicken breast either, it seemed to be parts. We probably won't be back.
__label__2	Breakfast was very expensive. $25 for an omelette and 2 egg platter. Not worth it for the amount paid. Also had about 10 flies in the dining area.
__label__2	If you go, do not park in a parking garage without an attendant! We have been in this garage for an hour due to the pay machine. And no one to call!
__label__2	Perfect location for after a paddle but only if you just want drinks. Every time we try to have lunch the staff seems completely overwhelmed even though there are lots of empty tables and then you either leave or wait forever for mediocre food.
__label__2	Their pizza and Stromboli's are horrible. Pizza was soggy and bot crisp like it should be. The Stromboli's are small and not of very good quality. Party of 4 tonight and the service was horrible! We won't be back and DO NOT Recommend this place to anyone. Poor quality of food.
__label__2	Food was so so customer service was yet to be desired. I don't want to sit next to someone who it not trying to get a fix. Waitress was more worried about their friend rather than their customers.
__label__2	Cindy moved back to China last year and the taste went with her. We have been a 2-3 times a month customer for years
__label__2	The servers were great and enthusiastic. They made wonderful suggestions but the food and drink fell flat in a splash of overpriced garlic grossness. The shrimp and grits were covered in garlic. The salad was not recognizable as a salad - though the ingredients were obviously from the ground. Eh...the dessert was beautiful and yummy. But please - please - do not pay an up charge for a dessert. It's not worth it.
__label__2	Seated fast and service was good. Food...not so much. Burnt ends sandwich was not much of burnt ends and had no flavor. Fries were just fries nothing special. Not worth it for the price. Everything was flavorless.
__label__2	Not a huge fan, the chili didn't have much flavor and the sandwich was forgettable. I will give it another shot, but so far not impressed.
__label__2	Great staff, good food (minus some salt) but my complaint is CLEANLINESS. The bathroom was gross, floor in the main dining area is dirty, and the tables were not clean. There's also these filthy metal containers on the tables holding utensils that.  I almost asked for clean silverware because I didn't want to use what was on the table but didn't want to be rude. I had the vegan pho bowl and it was very good but too salty. The staff was very friendly and the service was great.
__label__2	I've actually been to this place trying to support locals and I love your donuts. My sister was actually considering going to order donuts for my niece's bday party on Thursday (donut themed) but she went into the shop and the girl was so rude to her that she decided to go with some of yalls competitors. Customer service is everything to us because we have been in the industry for a long time! Just thought you should know .
__label__2	It was our first time coming here and we were so excited about it. Atmosphere is beautiful, music was nice...but the service SUCKS! The host sat us down and it took about 15 minutes for a server to come and give us the menu. Then maybe another 10 minutes to give us water. The food was okay...I guess I had high expectations. The only time I would come back is maybe to have the watermelon drink..then move on to the next bar.
__label__2	Today the boneless wings were cold and the celery looked as if they were thrown in dirt, and not wash off. In other words they were looking like it was expiring.
__label__2	Food was amazing, but service was awful. We had to walk in to find our server, she never checked in after dropping the food or refilled our drink orders. Once the check was dropped she only grabbed half the groups checks, and didn't come back after ran majority of the cards so the rest of us had to leave cash. Upon looking at the receipt saw gratuity was added so makes sense why service was poor. Just feel like if you're going to auto grat you should at least give decent service.
__label__2	This place ain't nothing special.... service is not the best and food is a 6-10 ... the cocktails were cold ... give them that
__label__2	"Against my better judgement, I stopped in to Jay's.  I always order spicy tuna handroll from every sushi spot I try, to gauge how good the place is.  Jay's, is not my favorite, to say the least.

The sushi is edible, but not tasty, and the only plus side was that it is reasonably priced and fast.  

Something upsetting was that I had seen the sushi man smoking a cigarette outside right after he made my roll..I hope he washed his hands!"
__label__2	Went in for lunch. Waitress was very nice. Food was so so. Had a hangover burger. Not really flavorful.  Teriyaki wings are heavy soy flavored. Fries are good. At least it's not really loud inside.
__label__2	"I have done a few haunted/ghost tours in different cities in the past and this was my least favorite.  There just wasn't anything special about this tour.  We kept running into other tour groups that seemed to be having a lot more fun than ours.  I kept thinking, ""I wish I was in that group!""  She just wasn't very interesting to listen to and there wasn't anything about her that seemed like a ""Voodoo Priestess.""  

I would not recommend this tour."
__label__2	Unfortunately this will be the last time for us. The food is good, but inconsistent. Service is also inconsistent. Waited 1 hour for take out, after being told 30min, only to be told that the order was never put through. Hostess was flustered and consequently rude. Thankfully there was an additional hostess who fixed things.
__label__2	There is always a security guard at this place, obviously because its located in New Orleans but his attitude is seriously rediculous. He's so rude, never smiles, and assumes the worst from everybody that walks through the door. I guess being on canal street, it's meant to be busy. But three cashiers at 11pm and there were at least 8 people in each line was a joke. Oh well. It's Walgreens. If you need something here be sure to be extra friendly to the cop on duty, because he hates life!
__label__2	Food was ok but I have never been so rushed at a restaurant.  Waitress asked if we needed take out boxes before we had a chance to get the second bite of food in our mouths.  Check was dropped off within 5 minutes of getting entrees.  I understand trying to turn the table but that was ridiculous.  Food in menu did not look anything like what showed up at the table.  We will not be back anytime soon.
__label__2	3 Mbps for $39.99 stop kidding around comast, whats the real price and real speed you're offering?
__label__2	Pretty simple, the food is above average but for some reason the cashier here is ALWAYS rude.  She always rushes you out so that she can look at her phone.  Maybe I'm just being a baby....
__label__2	"Food was not too bad - quite authentic, but lacking a real punch.  Prices a little high maybe for what it is.  

More of an issue though -  is they don't turn the heat on very high (even after asking them) - and you might be fully freezing during the whole meal."
__label__2	The hollandaise on the Eggs Benedict was pathetic. That would have been ok if it wasn't so expensive. It didn't help that the OJ was bitter. On the plus side my niece's breakfast burrito was good!
__label__2	Eighteen minutes from time of order to get my drinks.  Ridiculous.  Food took over 20 minutes.
__label__2	The man cutting my hair cut the part on the wrong side and I had it how I wanted it when I came in . Wanted to look business professional and came out looking like Macklemore
__label__2	Meh... Its ok if you can deal with trumptards/rednecks everywhere. Staff isnt very helpful. Selection kinda sucks. Not to mention its not really a charity at all. Anyway. 2 stars.
__label__2	Employee special events bar tender Kyle absolute worst customer service ever. Otherwise nice hotel but this jerk totally ruined it.
__label__2	They changed their fries to skinny little mcdonalds fries and their quality has gone down a lot and prices have increased. If youre going to serve worse food at least decrease the price.
__label__2	"Messed up order TWICE-  and took awhile to fix it strike one.   I had to ask for a refill of my $3.95 drip coffee- strike two.  No adjustment to the check without me asking (asked to remove coffee).  They did. 

Service- 4 out of 10
Food- 8 out of 10
Coffee. 5 out of 10. 

Gotta do better to get 5 stars in Webster."
__label__2	Very disappointing dining experience. The two star rating is only because we were a walk-in party of fourteen the day after Christmas, We were seated in a very cold and drafty room the chairs were very flimsy plastic and two were broken. The food and service were mediocre at best. We had to ask for a beer list and were only given one for a party of 14. The menu unimaginative, just the usual pub fare.
__label__2	Every time that I come here I promise myself that I won't come back. Although the staff is nice the turnaround time for a basic oil change is ridiculous. Even though I make an appointment through the app I'm still stuck waiting anywhere from 1-2 hours. What's the point of making an appointment? Also, the upselling is annoying. Every single time.
__label__2	"***UPDATE***
Got a ""compliment"" notice from Yelp from a Thao L. who accused me of being from another nail salon to check them out.  Don't know who this person is, but this type of online harassment is completely unwelcome and on unfounded grounds.  Stay away!"
__label__2	I am giving it two stars because the waffle was good. Our server Frank was abrupt. He handled our lemon wedges with bare hands no tongs. They didn't have real butter. They must like washing dishes everything was served on individual plates even the two small cookie cutter sausages. Yuk. I think Mc Donald's is better. We went there because of the 3.5 star rating. I guess Tennessee'ns have a low bar for breakfast or is it food in general?
__label__2	comfy beds and large rooms. nothing close by to walk to, but has a shuttle to the airport where you can catch the train. bar is way overpriced, food is nothing special and wi-fi is not free.
__label__2	I really want to like this area, but it just never seems to deliver. It seems like the required base has never developed.
__label__2	"Cool little spot to pull up to. But the food..

First the chicken is a huge solid cut of chicken breast which you need a knife to get through. 
Second. It wasn't crispy. Come on man. 
Third. Medium was more chalky texture than I've ever had and not all that spicy. 


Meh."
__label__2	Terrible service. Our waitress disappeared for long stretches, forget food ordered, and was generally uninterested in serving our group. Food was average and nothing exciting.
__label__2	The service was good and they did my nails pretty fast but I got gel and it chipped the next day. I usually get my nails done near North Philly but I heard this was a good place since I was near there already. But from my experience of Gel, don't get it here
__label__2	I placed an order, around 70.00 for a few extra large hoagies & some sides, they were terrible! Italian was so soggy it leaked through the paper, through the bag and was dripping on my floor, the tuna was so watery, that roll was ruined too. Nothing about this order was good, very disappointed they would send food out like that.
__label__2	The server didn't bring whatever belonged to what was ordered  ie..straws, soysauce...and you had to ask several times for these items. Food wasn't top rate. This was my father's 88th birthday. Won't come back. Managerial staff did not ask if everything was okay with our meal or if there was any way they could make our dinner experience better.
__label__2	"Good pizza but they never have Hot and Readys of anything
Even when I call ahead to order I still have to wait because they've given mine away"
__label__2	Was hoping this would be another family friendly, neighborhood spot,  but its strictly 21 and over. Not sure why, since it has the sports bar and grill type feel.  Just have to stick to City Park Grill and Blackthorn
__label__2	Stay away unless you are in the mood for overly salty and MSG-loaded dishes that have been left out under the heat lamps for hours.  The pepper steak was tough and covered in a coagulated sauce that was so salty that I drank 2 bottles of water with it. The best part was the steamed vegetables and rice, most likely because those didn't require any culinary skills.The staff are decent but the food could definitely use some improvement.  The portions are also tiny and the prices very steep, even at the KOP mall, for what you actually get ($9 for rice and 2 selections).
__label__2	A for effort of decorations and topping selection, but the flavor and freshness was lacking. Yogokiss yogurt is textured like a custard, which some prefer, but I don't like. There was no perceptible tang. I asked if they made the yogurt in store from milk or if they used a mix and added water, but the server did not know. They had Natural, Chocolate, and Taro flavors when I visited. Taro flavor, really.
__label__2	It said they opened at 11am on Sundays online.. got there at 11 and waited 10 minutes- no one showed. RUDE!
__label__2	This place is really overrated. The food wasn't really good and the service was horrible. The custom cocktail all seemed like someone was trying way too hard to be unique. I sent the first drink back because it tasted horrible.
__label__2	"The food is always wonderful, but the lighting is always dark there. The service can be hit or miss but is usually OK. As it is in a very hipster area, it seems to be the trend that looking more hipster somehow excuses service ability. Aside from that, the food and margaritas are very good.

Update: it took over an hour to get a check, let alone a glass of water the last time I went. Icing on the cake -- no toilet paper in the restroom. Get it together."
__label__2	I used to go here often with my boyfriend. The ice cream is good and the staff is friendly, however the last time we were there we saw two small roaches crawling on the glass where the ice cream can be viewed. We mentioned it to the girl working and she took care of the roaches. We haven't been back since.... Sorry!
__label__2	Chevy's in the Central West End.  More of the same tired menu and poor execution of typical Tex-Mex.  generic in every way.
__label__2	"Don't serve pizza by the slice. Smallest serving you can get is a small pie which is over $6 and the smallest drink brings up your lunch to almost $10.

The restaurant:
Smokers puffing and coughing right next to the open door next to the ""dine-in"" area which is two little tables with ugly ripped up chairs. 

Hostess smoking outside didn't even wash her hands when coming back in to take order and go back into the cooking area.

The pizza:
Overall pretty decent. A little greasy and could use a bit more sauce."
__label__2	Since my post I have received calls from the service director and the operations manager. After 7 months of trying to get parts ordered; the parts have been ordered and things are moving in the right direction.
__label__2	Just went Saturday night and it was so noisy .We changed our table two times and it didn't help.
__label__2	Eh! It was OK. I got take out from there. I had the crabmeat fried rice and coconut soup. Hmmmm....the soup was delish but the fried rice not so much.  Extremely greasy....little crabmeat.  Eh! I dont think I'll return. I'll stick with my usual place in Philly.
__label__2	This place got much better when it became ACME last year and has slowly gone WAY downhill. Half of the staff and friendly and nice and a handful are so incredibly unprofessional. I will go out of my way to go to a different market from now on. I wish it was a Trader Joe's. Everyone there is nice and polite.
__label__2	My girlfriends and I went to Strange Love for brunch because it had just opened up and we were curious. I got the Eggplant Jawn. The name of the dish is more pleasing than the actual dish itself. It was way too salty, greasy, and unfulfilling. It's not somewhere I'd go again.
__label__2	The good things about this place are the fast service. We ordered lunch and it was ready for pick up in 20 minutes for 12 people. The staff is also friendly and accommodating giving all the sides and utensils we needed. Food wasn't terrible, but nothing spectacular. Just seemed to be lacking some flavor and was bland. Not sure if I would go back when there are other options nearby.
__label__2	"Sadly not what they used to be.   Apparently a new chef and based on how the manager acted , probably a new owner as well.  
The dishes are dramatically different from the past and not for the better"
__label__2	"We went here after work one night, after waiting in line for around 5 minutes we noticed that they didn't accept debit at the cash register. This place must be in the early 90's or something.

Oh they had a atm that I'm sure charged you $5 to take some money out, and possibly had a card skimmer attached to it. No thanks!"
__label__2	I've been a long time customer of Luke's but today they served me frozen lobster that was tough, slimy and stringy. Very, very disappointed when I brought it to their attention and nothing was done. I have introduced this restaurant to so many of my friends. I hope this doesn't happen again or my friends and I will go elsewhere.  On a more positive note the crab, grilled cheese and bisque were as good as always.
__label__2	Service was good, however the breakfast was horrible. Food was dry and coffee was the worse. Wouldn't recommend and will not be returning.
__label__2	"First, the waitress was very nice, what a sweet person.

Other than that? It's a $40 meal with a $100 bill. The grilled oysters looked and tasted like they were microwaved. The vaunted redfish was utterly boring. The crawfish ravioli tasted just like Rouse's frozen ravioli although the crawfish sauce on top was pretty good.

If you're coming in from McKeesport PA and ""want to do New Orleans"" this is the place for you. Otherwise it's a pass for me."
__label__2	"I was sure I had found the ultimate cookie dough treat. And it just didn't do it. Great concept, no eggs equal 0 risk of food poisoning,  good idea , but the 2 flavors I tried, chocolate chip and rocky road where not sweet and the dough was to thin. I so wanted it to be sweet, decadent goo of an experience and it failed.
It just isn't for me. I will eat my cookie dough the old fashion way."
__label__2	I hate writing bad reviews and seldom do, but we ordered food tonight and it just wasn't good. For starters out order was wrong. Not all of it mind you, but still wrong. The rest of the order was correct, but none of it good. The pizza was bland, lacking sauce, overall just not good. We also ordered a corned beef sandwich and it was also fairly awful. Sorry guys but this was just a no across the board.
__label__2	"Awful restaurant I have ever been to and I have been to a lot of Indian restaurants all over USA.

We were at their lunch buffet and there was not one item on their menu that was done right! 

The place looks good and well equipped to be a great restaurant but too bad they don't seem to be trying hard enough. 

2 stars go only to the location and the place itself and none to the actual food."
__label__2	This place is great for watching football or whatever games, tons of TV, but the  food is disappointing it's like a half step up from Chillis or Applebee's.
__label__2	Sally super nice to let us drive through if out in 15 minutes.  We were able to cover the whole rode.  Not much of a park or facility unless maybe camping.  Otherwise, not worth $7 fee.  You can see plenty of similar cacti anywhere in Tucson.
__label__2	Was ok. For a diner that wasn't all that busy it took a while to our food. It wasn't that hot either. It was semi flavorful. I had the Texas bbq burger deluxe that came with fries and onion rings. Asked for medium and got well done. Cost was $8.95. The waitress seemed ok and tended to us ok. It might be a while before I try going back.
__label__2	Beautiful place with a wonderful menu but awful, awkward service wrecked the evening. Waited almost 30 mins for wine, waiter was not attentive nor accommodating. Good food + bad service equals not another visit.
__label__2	Just got off of work been waiting for more than 30 mins. I decided to take the ferry because it's a straight shot to New Orleans East. But a total waste of time. I should've sucked it up and had taken the CCC for all of this. Would've been home by now. It's a hit or miss at times. There should def be 2 ferries. One for each way. But of course, the city is cheap.
__label__2	Specifically asked about the buy 1 get 1 for happy hour today and got home only to find out that they didn't apply the promo.
__label__2	Stopped in for breakfast before shopping at Costco next door.  I was appalled to look up from my booth at the frames and pictures on the wall to find them covered in fly feces, that plus my table was vibrating from the freezer on the other side of the wall. Really IHOP you cannot at least wipe down your wall hangings!!!    Who knows what is in the kitchen if there is so little attention paid to where the customers eat!
__label__2	I would have rather stopped in for a drink to listen to the band and gone elsewhere for our meal. The bartender paid no attention even when drinks were empty and never checked in once the food arrived. There were only two others at the upstairs bar so the beer got restocked instead. The food was just ok. If I would do it again I would stick to an appetizer at best and move on for better food.
__label__2	"Food, good like you'd expect
Host and waiters with excellent
Cleanliness 1/5, saw a member of the staff walk out of a stall right back to work, apparently some employees in a restaurant are exempt from washing hands"
__label__2	This deli is overrated. The food here is average. Burgers, sandwiches, greasy fries. I really do not understand why this place is busy during lunch when it isn't even that good. The customer service here is just HORRIBLE, from the beginning till the end. One thing I despise is when restaurants claim that their food tastes just like food from New York, when it tastes nothing like it. Go to a real deli or even a bodega in New York, and then go to Lucky Dill. They do not even compare!
__label__2	Visiting philadelphia for the first time and this was the first restaurant i went to here, i open my box to find a long dark hair next to my crepe. Absolutely ******* disgusting. With as many choice words as i have i'll just say, start wearing hairnets or the health department is going to shut it all down.
__label__2	Overpriced orchids. Fun to walk through to look, but you can't buy most of what they have. It is roped off. My husband innocently found an unusual orchid he wanted, not in the roped off area,and when we went to the front to buy it the saleswomen ripped it from his hands and said he wasn't allowed to buy that and where did he find it. Really? Went to Gallup instead. Much better prices and service.
__label__2	SBSC didn't have the kind of crab (king, rock) we wanted so we ordered the local crab. It was a disappointment. Clam chowder and lobster bisque were passable.
__label__2	"Even with the recent renovations, it's still a dump. 
The new jumbo screen was a nice touch though so that you could see huge tears as they lost the Territorial Cup in glorious HD"
__label__2	Food was OK, but there was this strange and really awkward guy walking around tables interrupting your conversation and telling bad jokes. It seemed like he was an employee, if not a manager. Totally inappropriate and unprofessional.
__label__2	This place has gone downhill since they changed over from Sunflower Market. For example. I went in for gluten-free stuffing for Thanksgiving. They had one box and it was, wait for it, NINE DOLLARS. It's not worth it to me to drive this far and pay this much when Safeway is now carrying so many gluten free options. Such a shame.
__label__2	Read the reviews and headed over. Terrible disappointment! The Shrimp and Grits were served cold,  the crab cake was so crispy it was closer to being burnt, the gumbo was mediocre and the pork sandwich consisted of crock pot pork with three pickle slices!  Service was poor. Courtyard setting was pretty and tranquil. Not worth the inflated price  of the food.
__label__2	Came in at 12:45 with nail in my tire. Told it would take 45 minutes to an hour IT'S NOW 2:45 AND IM STILL HERE! !! You see I left to go  pickup tee shirts  for PourHouse at Goodwill and I guess they forgot about me! ! I guess it PAYS when you have Road Hazard with them! :-(
__label__2	Disappointing. The shrimp with lobster sauce had no taste to the sauce and few shrimp. The beef fried rice had NO beef in it. The orange chicken was ok. Not going back
__label__2	The girl there is angry, not friendly at all. Maybe she keeps up that attitude with her bad reviews. I went because it's closer to where I live. Not ever again. She scares me lol. Basically despite her, the papers were signed and she notarized.
__label__2	Food was mediocre and service was bad.  Couldn't even split a bill correctly for a table with 3 couples.  Can't say id go here again.
__label__2	I was not a fan of Prime time. The chips and queso were extremely bland and asked for some buffalo sauce to give it some taste. My husband had the bleu burger and he said it was ok. The service.. WHat service? She never came around. It was not busy at all.
__label__2	The outside and inside of the restaurant is stunning, however when you go to a Polish restaurant at 6 o'clock on a Saturday and they're out pierogies, and sauerkraut and make you wait an hour and 15 minutes....  And they definitely aren't given the food away it is a pretty big letdown many service errors
__label__2	"The bar had a cute tropical feel to it.  You could see the hussle and bustle of State Street and the bartenders.
I loved how they bring you your tab in a cigarette box.
i had the Porto Guava cocktail.  it was good but did not WOW me."
__label__2	We've gone here 3 times snow and it's an okay place for a night out.  The food is generally chain quality and not exceptionally flavorful. I feel the same about their beers as well. Service was good each time, and meals were brought out in a reasonable amount of time. It's one of those places you end up at once or twice a year when you don't feel like driving any distance.  With the amount of high quality gastropubs just across the bridge, it's hard to accept the blandness delivered here.
__label__2	I keep trying to give this location the benefit of the doubt but I'm just done with it now. Another visit with items unavailable and then I get the wrong drink. We ordered 2 drinks, one tea and one mocha and they give us a hazelnut? Ordered a Bagel with butter, but you'd think were under a butter rationing order. I was going to look past the curt drive through attitude but with the order fail too, the whole experience was a disappointment.
__label__2	We tried this place for lunch. Food was ok. We had shrimp fajitas and carnitas plate. Not a whole lot of flavor with both meals.  Ordered desserts. Horchata bread pudding and apple pie taco ala mode   They were really good.  Service needs improvement. Waitress took a good 3-5 mins to finally come over to the table and ask if we needed anything. Not sure if we will go back.
__label__2	Always understaffed. Time for managers to do some managing instead of always being caught out by the rush or whatever other excuse is flavor of the day
__label__2	This place is okay. The staff was friendly but the service was shitty and it wasn't the girls fault bc they were under staffed and doing the best they can. Mediocre burger and not so good service equal epic fail for a return
__label__2	The toppings variety was great! I just wish the veggie dog was like an actual dog and not a veggie burger sliced in half. I liked being there tho!
__label__2	"The food here is ok, because the dipping sauce does not taste like the sauce in JP. The dish ""seafood and yasai"" is too salty."
__label__2	We are new to the area and we were looking for our new favorite Thai restaurant. We'll this isn't it!  We weren't very hungry, so we placed a pickup order for Fresh Rolls and Tom Kha. The rolls were mainly lettuce and the soup was okay, but the serving size was very disappointing. We know prices for food have increased everywhere, but $18.00 for this was unacceptable. We'll keep on looking!
__label__2	Let me start by saying the food was very good. My problem was with the bill. We had a group and they automatically charged a 25% tip on our tabs. I am totally fine with automatic group gratuities, but the maximum I have ever encountered is 20%. It wasn't stated anywhere either, but easy to do the math.
__label__2	"Was so glad that there is a pizza place a block away, yet it was a disappointment. I ordered the ""T-Bird special"" pizza which was supposed to include asparagus. There was probably half of one spear of asparagus that was shredded into super thin slivers, placed one about every 3"". If it's a case of running out of an ingredient, just say so - don't stretch it. Got fries here once too and they were soggy. Bummer."
__label__2	The breakfast sandwhiches don't live up to the hype, so sad. The staff are nice and friendly though.
__label__2	Our server was the only person working the tables. She was running ragged trying to keep up while the other employees stood around. Food was over priced for the French Quarter. There is much better restaurants in the area with better prices. Beer selection was lacking as well. As a plus, the musicians were great.
__label__2	This is a good restaurant. One of the (waiters?) Was talking about his snakes he breeds. I axed him about if he breeds dogs(touchy subject). Overall EXCELLENT stuff!
__label__2	"Sat at the bar and
Tried to order for a while.
Was ignored.  I left."
__label__2	We stayed at this park for 4 days.  We enjoyed touring around the area viewing all the beautiful beaches.  The park itself had nothing to offer.  We paid for a premium site that had no cable, no WiFi and we couldn't even get antenna tv.  It was awful.  For four days we watched scrambled tv channels.  For what we paid for this place it was a big ripoff. This park had no other redeeming qualities and most of the residents were unfriendly.  We would never go back again and will not recommend this place to anyone else.
__label__2	Steak dinner...or eat here??....hmmmm... decisions decisions....you might need to take out a loan.
__label__2	I used to go there a long time ago. Then found out they did not cut my hair like I wanted.. They messed up the hair cut... I will never step in there again
__label__2	"I ordered through Uber eats from this place
I ordered a burger and a poutine dish they call the ""Canuck""
I specified in my instructions to not add salt to these fries(picture shows what I said)
Upon getting the order and taking a fork of the Canuck I found that it should be called THE OCEAN. Instead of No Salt it was more like they added extra salt. It was way beyond anything edible.
I filed a problem report through Uber eats but haven't heard anything.
A gave two stars for the burger, which was ok but for what was paid nothing was worth the price."
__label__2	Food is good but I go thru drive thru once a week and it's always something no pork no ribs wait for chicken. U
__label__2	"Full disclosure: I didn't actually eat here, but I'm still rating my experience.

Took a day trip to Santa Barbara and was looking for a nice treat to soothe the hot summer sun. Yelped Backyard Bowls to find a very highly-rated option. Excited, we parked and went in and walked right back out.

The options were complex, overpriced, and limited. It didn't look like I'd be able to get a simple vanilla frozen yogurt. Santa Barbara could benefit from a simple ice cream shop or a Yougurtland or something similar."
__label__2	"This is what you get at 4-5am.  Loud TV's 
Oh and the parking goes as follows 
30$ - 6 hours or more for self park go to bed wake up you pay this. Go out to tour or whatever you pay this.  Valet =$56.  

Sleep in til 2p = 60$
Parking on the street is like musical chairs. Good luck on that. Oh did I mention the noise !!!"
__label__2	Drinks absolutely suck and service equally sucks. Only went to this place because it was close to our hotel and we wanted a nightcap. We had the worst old fashion ever. Place seems like it's kind of a chain and pretty farty. I'd pass if I would have read the reviews beforehand.
__label__2	"Meh, the food is decent.  Good flavor and everything, but it's overpriced for the amount of food you get.  I got the Duck Tacos, and they were good, but there were only two, they were tiny, and there wasn't anything that came with them.....just two miniature tacos, served on a cutting board.

The beer is selection is decent, but I didn't feel like supplementing my remaining hunger with beer, due to its excessive price too.

The service was prompt and friendly, however, I won't be back."
__label__2	We ordered the citrus salmon with risotto. My boyfriend asked for the blackened salmon but it was not blackened. The risotto was missing flavor and was not creamy at all. Had high expectations for this restaurant but was underwhelmed. For the price, I was surely disappointed in the taste. As for curbside pickup, there are no signs for curbside. You have to park in the handicap parking and alert the staff when you arrive.
__label__2	Often too crowded and has trouble-making crazy people inside.  I become impatient with things there like: this place made a tasty hamburger but they put salt on it plus the order taker talked crude.  Food would have tasted better without salt.
__label__2	"Had dinner here, it's pretty bad. They hawk the place based on it having once been on ""diners drive-in's and dives"" in fact they have a movie poster up at the entrance and hawkers tell everyone who walks by.

Well, those days are past. The food is mediocre at best now, service also subpar. But the kicker is the price, $30/person. They obviously survive on gouging tourists and milking the TV fame"
__label__2	"Chicken Parm was hard and crunchy. When I called to complain the owner got very nasty. This was after 1 hour wait. They did send out another but we had to wait another 1/2 hour. They should let someone with better customer service experience answer complaints before this guy runs off all there costumers. 
Gone for good."
__label__2	b.good is not.good.   The fries were practically room temperature.  The burger was served raw.  The seasoning was off.  The acoustics of the restaurant itself are so poor that I couldn't wait to leave.  It's an interesting concept but it needs some improvement.
__label__2	"eh. it was okay. nothing special and nothing i'd like to come back too.

the room rate was only 99$ a night fri/sat and 44$ on sun. so it was cheap and cheap was what i got.

the room was okaaay. except it was noah's ark in the bathtub...the drain was clogged.

when in reno...."
__label__2	They saw right away did work right away but charged 200% over and didn't actually fix what needed to be fixed just something else than what we said needed to be done a week later it's giving the same issue and take it back to be told what we said needed to be done needed to be replaced and he wanted to charge 350+ took it to our regular mechanic in Philly and only cost 80$.
__label__2	I tried the thai tea which tastes some favor of medicine. Still many people wait for this bad boba tea. I should walk into the starbuck and order the vanilla latte next time.
__label__2	Overall the food was on par with any other fast food restaurant, although rather pricey for what you get. I was quite disgusted that the owners chose to play religious music. Keep your opinions at home and not foisted upon the general public. It would also be a good idea to train staff to not place their hands on customers regardless of intentions.
__label__2	Depressing. Tired. Happy hour is coors light pints... :| Seriously? And no HH food? WTH???? Surprisingly busy though. Not sure what people see in this place. Maybe cuz it's close to home?
__label__2	Ate outside, not very impressed with the ambiance. Lots of road noise and an overwhelming odor of fish. Food was OK, the caprese salad was terrible, tomatoes were hothouse and very hard to cut through, very little balsamic dressing. Entree of shrimp and scallops was OK. Special of new Zealand cockles was also just OK. Both meals were too pricey. Will not eat here again.
__label__2	"The sushi here was just plain bad, but the service was good (when the food was taking a long time, the server brought us a free appetizer, without us even complaining). 

Most disappointing was a roll (I forget the name) that had a deep fried shrimp in it. The batter wasn't fully cooked, so when I took a bite, I got a mouthful of wet, uncooked batter - ick! The fish seemed fresh enough, but noting was good enough to warrant a repeat visit."
__label__2	No Pequena Colombia. Food was ok but not great in my opinion. I love the empanadas from Pequena Colombia on Nebraska in Tampa which remind me of my Queens, NY roots. I now live in Pinellas so decided to give this place a try but not as good as I had hoped. I would rather drive the 17 miles.
__label__2	Amazing pizza but the people who answer the phone are horribly rude. Called for pickup and the guy was clearly annoyed (sorry for calling to order pizza from a pizza place???) and rushed me off the phone, literally like hung up before I was done. Called back, the lady who answered was the same way. I needed to clarify that that guy got my order correct. So ridiculous. I get you're busy, but come on. I've always loved this place but for the price I'm saying, this service is not cutting it.
__label__2	Ordered takeout, quoted 20-25 minutes. It took 45 with no apology or consideration. Poor showing team!
__label__2	Very loud, very busy, waitress rushed salad before we ate one forth of the of the appetizer.   The meal came out before we started salad.  Felt very rushed.  Over all the food was good with the exception of the steak.  Same quality steak as I got at Ponderosa, it has to be frozen and not fresh cut.  I will not be back,
__label__2	Up to this point, our dining experience in New Orleans had been wonderful. That was until we came to Stanley.  Our waitress never made eye contact, never asked how our food was (semi-warm), and then at the end, said we wouldn't get a bill, but rather that she would show us her hand-held electronic device detailing our purchase. She hovered over us while we were instructed to choose a tip amount in front of her. The worst  part was that she was loud with her coworkers the entire time in the background. Very poor management here.
__label__2	We used to Love ordering their pizza and absolutely loved their chicken wings, but for the third time they've run out of wings before 7pm. I think they changed their pizza dough recipe as well as their toppings. I don't think we will be ordering their pizza anymore, the only thing good about my order today was the coke. Rusty it is from now on... So sad.
__label__2	"If only they put as much effort into the food as they put into the decor.

The decor - nice baseball touches here and there
The view - big windows facing the stadium
Noise level - decent
Service - attentive and perky

Food - nobody finished their food.  Bland grilled cheese, terrible potato chips, mediocre fries, disappointing nachos.

Could be a good place to have a beer  (they have some non-Budweiser choices).  and visit the Hall of Fame upstairs and the gift shop next door."
__label__2	Stopped in when in Westport and had a few drinks. Overall bar was dirty and smelled like smoke, on top of that charging $7.50 for a Rebel IPA is nuts.
__label__2	Too loud (both music and baristas), too hot, smells like a toaster (no ventilation , alright coffee, beautiful inside, pastry was delicious
__label__2	Food is good but the service has to be one of the worst in South Tampa. Took the hostess 10 minutes to acknowledge us and 10 more minutes for the bartender to address us.
__label__2	The food is always fresh and amazing! Service however is an entirely different problem. They are inattentive, unopologetic and rude with a smile on their face.
__label__2	Placed an order through the app 24 hours in advance. Arrived to pick up and they were out of 2 cookies I ordered. No apology or explanation, just pick other flavors. The order was paid for and there are no options to cancel or change the quantity, so I had to make substitutions. Management needs to ensure the inventory is adequate so orders can be fulfilled. The cookies are fine, tasty and fresh, but the overall experience was disappointing.
__label__2	bleh....like every other casino. hot and stuffy, smokey, packed, don't like staying long on the few times I do come. If you are a fan of casinos and gambling then it is right up your alley. If you don't care either way like myself then save yourself from smelling like an ashtray and go somewhere else with friends.
__label__2	We went not twice but three times to do Christmas shopping and we were let down and left because all the departments were not restocked!  I was told by a cashier that the truck only comes in once a week!  That is an operation plan for failure not to restock two to three times a week during the holidays when 85% of your customers visit to do shopping and leave with a negative shopping experience and 50% never return to have their limited shopping time squandered on the store's mismanagement!
__label__2	The spinach artichoke was to salty., shrimp pasta was over cooked , good oysters , bad Bloody Mary- bacon at bottom .. Slow service .. But waiter was nice ... Won't be back though ...
__label__2	"High Hopes were crushed. 

I personally think this place is too praised for what it actually is....gourmet Mexican food that lacks true Mexican roots and flavor."
__label__2	"Visited this location 3 times, twice I was served a sandwich on stale bread.  It's such an obvious and unforgettable error. 

I'm done with Lucky Dill."
__label__2	"I used Silvia's cleaning service and they weren't bad, but I wouldn't say they were great either.  I think they do a really good job on windows and bathrooms, but eh on other areas.  

Their prices are median, but for about 2 hours for two people the cost was a little over $100.  You can definitely find those who are more expensive, but there are also those who are less.  

If I had a rental or am moving in/out, i would use them again, but I wouldn't say they are the best service that i've used."
__label__2	Turkey hoagie was lacking in the turkey and for 8.49 way overpriced IMO!. There is a lot of other competition in the area that offers better sandwiches with more filling for less $.  No wonder this place looks like its empty all the time when I drive by...
__label__2	The water element is tiny, everything is faded, and the picnic pavilion has never felt the touch of a power wash. The bathroom is straight out of Orange is the New Black. I only give the second star because it has a bathroom. That's all that's going for this park!
__label__2	ZERO social distancing. They didn't even try! People everywhere. The servers were not wearing masks or gloves. The guy preparing the food was not wearing a mask or gloves. No cleaning or disinfecting counters, pens, tables, etc. Good food, but not worth dying for - or even just getting sick. VERY irresponsible!
__label__2	Enthusiastic performance, but - for the love - update your decor! It looks like 1987 in there. The food is tired, no local beer, and the desserts are clearly from a box.
__label__2	Food was good. Dessert was awesome. Service was horrible. Portions sizes were really small for price
__label__2	We didn't even go in as the entire establishment looked shady. There was a security guard standing at the door (for what?), the windows were covered so that you couldn't see inside (again, why?), and the whole exterior was just so unwelcoming and again just shady looking. It was just bizarre.
__label__2	Not the biggest fan. I typically get the spicy tuna roll.... My boyfriend LOVES Vic and swears by them. I on the other hand would rather eat someplace else
__label__2	Use to really love this place! The food was great and they have interesting options. However, the last couple of times the same items have been different (smaller in size from $11 dinner to what looks like half an appetizer, cold, unseasoned) and also an instance where I ordered a wrap dinner and received... just a wrap. Not sure what's going on but I love supporting local business and they're a staple. Hope something changes, would love to eventually return!
__label__2	"Was not impressed.  After hearing all the hype about this place I gave it a shot.  Meatballs were great, but I also had the chicken, White Fish,
potatoes (way over cooked), spaghetti and broccoli.  It was an odd combination of food to say the least...   My plate left me feeling more like I was at a company pot luck and less like a fine restaurant.  Everything was just ""good"", but nothing made me want to seek this place out again."
__label__2	"I really wish i could give a full review on this place. We have been wanting to go for a while & finally went tonight. After literally 15 mins of no one approaching our table to even say,""we'll be with you in a minute, we got up & left. They had 3 servers, so, not exactly sure what the deal was. Hopefully, if we try again, things will be better."
__label__2	I do not understand the hype. The portions are small and it's expensive. We ordered dinner then had to go for dinner afterwards. Also unfortunately, we ordered via skip the dishes, so the missing goat cheese from my salad and the missing cilantro from my sandwich, came with no explanation or remedy. About the only good thing was the cherry iced tea.
__label__2	Nothing special about this place besides proximity. No matter how you tell them to cook your food (wings for example), they won't do it. Most of the bartenders couldn't care less about you or refilling a drink.
__label__2	Whatever you do, don't go here if filling your stomach and value for the price are priorities.  $7.95 for a caramelo that was maybe three bites' worth, and wasn't even hot by the time I got it home?  No thanks.  Lame, overpriced Mexican food-come here to get ripped off!
__label__2	Omg..gave this place a 3rd try and the food still sucks. Ordered the black cherry peach Mojito strong and they still bought out a glass of sugar water. The food was room temp. It suffices to say, you fail me 3x and I'm done. You can offer me a free meal and I still won't go...Ush!
__label__2	I have eaten at Pomodoro Pizza for many years.  This time was the last.  I ordered an Italiana pizza and it was soggy all except 2 inches from the crust.  This is definitely NOT what a South Jersey Pizza is supposed feel like or taste like.  I realize there are a good amount of ingredients on it, but soggy pizzas are absolutely disgusting.I threw out the pizza.  The meatballs smelled suspiciously like prepackaged meatballs.  I am from south Jersey and my ex owned his own pizzeria.  I know good and bad pizza.  This was NOT good pizza in the least.
__label__2	"Wow, all the other reviews were right. If it wasn't for the free booze the main terminal is much nicer. 
I found the funky musty smell to be the most troubling."
__label__2	I used to love this place!  People were amazing, usually quality of service was awesome....then new managers came in. I'm ok, given the new managers   are super sweet and friendly and trying to make the space amazing. All of this is true...the problem lies in that the quality is significantly going down hill. Dip nails for the first time chipped on day 2 and 3.  Which means my European vacation needs to be amended to fill in a second manicure.  I  seriously loved this place for a year....I'm not going back!!
__label__2	"I've been here before, food is usually really good, not so much tonight. Shrimp Po-Boy and Jambalaya was not eatable. Really disappointed. 
Staff and service was great, as always."
__label__2	I wish I could find a place that was able to continue to groom my dogs and have them look as good as they did the first time sadly happy tails is in that group. The first and second time my dogs looked great the last time I took my dogs there a few days after I got home I realized that one of my boys topknot  was a little weird looking most of it was cut off on the front when I took him back they said oh yeah I think he moved they should've told me that when I picked him up not hid it from me. So very disappointed!!
__label__2	"Disappointing.

Dinner
   the good - nice room with a feeling of authenticity.Friendly staff, reasonable wine list

   the bad - Mancha Manteles:Pork loin overcooked to cardboard, Masa cake that needed a steak knife to cut. Long waits for food and service. Very dry meal. Dessert churro beyond dry."
__label__2	Pretty sad that you can't do a simple task. Add a name to an existing account. There was no one available to do this at this branch for at least 2 hours. She then made an appointment at another branch for us. When we got there we waited 15 minutes past the appointment time. The person that we informed of our appointment never actually informed Sarah that she had an appointment. Customer service severely lacking!!
__label__2	This place has gone downhill. Bathroom had no towels and looked like a homeless people lived in it. Bread is up charge now. Air conditioning wasn't working that well when I went.bar and decor looks like in style 7 years ago. Only drinking so can't speak for food. And people wonder why chain restaurants are doing poorly.
__label__2	Not the best sushi I've had but not the worst either. The seaweed salad tasted the same as every other sushi place. The California rolls had a lot of mayo with the crab. Don't think I'd go back.
__label__2	"Food quality has gone consistently downhill since they opened.

I've eaten here 6 or 7 times since they opened and the food has been worse every time.  I think they are just too busy and having a hard time keeping up with the long lines.

Some folks get cold food, some folks get hot food.  Some food comes significantly later than other folks at the table.  Some plates have sides missing.  Some plates have a lot less food than other plates (same dish).  Some food tastes unseasoned."
__label__2	The first time I went here the food was less then impressive, but I gave it a second chance last night. To no surprise the food was bland and nothing special. For the price I excepted a lot more.
__label__2	Slowest service in the market and the cashier, while sweet, didn't mention the up charge (which is more than listed on the board) when asking if I wanted both hot and sweet peppers. Also the ridiculous wait allowed me to watch the cooks touch a cellphone with his gloves on (geekiest thing around!) and get ice for drinks with his hands....so far my experience has not been impressive.
__label__2	"The kids who work at Roast are friendly.  They screw up things once in a blue moon, but that's to be expected.

The cookies offered there are good.  They're not the best that I've ever had, but they're good all the same.

The pain au chocolate is terrible.  It's some kind of thick, chewy abomination.  Avoid it at all costs.

The sandwiches are overpriced by about 40%.

The drinks are good enough, but they're not particularly memorable."
__label__2	This place was alright. The pasta wasn't that great. The moment we didn't want to order drinks, shifted our waiters attitude to a bad one. Maybe we should've ordered something different, but in my opinion, over priced for not that great of service or food.
__label__2	The staff didn't seem to really care if they had customers or not and the gyro was rather gross.  I don't say that lightly.  I was staring and I ended up throwing half of it out and getting lunch someplace else.
__label__2	Was really looking forward to going to Distrito, and was very disappointed.  Service was terrible, and the food was just ok.  Only thing good about this place were the nachos and the drinks.
__label__2	"Disappointed in new local burger place. Ordered ""The Our Burger"" (medium, as recommended - pink in the middle) and was served well done with no signature Wahl Sauce on it. They re-ordered it, which took quite a while (service was slow in general) and was again cooked well done. Even still, the thin pattie wasn't impressive and not worth the price."
__label__2	We are regular CWE Drunken Fish customers. We decided to try the Ball Park Village location because we are downtown. We ordered appetizers over an hour ago, have empty drinks and have not seen the waiter in over 30 minutes. The service is atrocious compared to the CWE location.
__label__2	It was alright. Burger was a bit tasteless. Everything else was good. Good came out in 5 minutes. Free ice cream cone after your meal.
__label__2	"I was excited to order the vegan gumbo from the menu. Sounded great. At the same time the other meals arrived at my table, the server told me they didn't have it. Stanley has a very compact menu; it sure seems like they would actually have the things listed there, or at least tell you when you order instead of waiting until the other meals arrived at the table. Bad form.

Two stars because my daughter was very happy with the bananas foster pancakes."
__label__2	I have had mixed experiences here. They are cheap, but this is the second time I have left with my fingers bleeding (I believe it is the same manicurist). I also got a pedicure and have polish all over my toes...no, not my toe nails. The edges of my nails are rough and not even.
__label__2	Greens so slow that you don't want to get used to them.  Not much else to say but meh....should have saved 10 bucks and played Northdale.
__label__2	The rice is good. The rest, not so much. I ordered the take out dinner for two, and each of the containers was only half full. Disappointing
__label__2	Decent food that have healthy options.  After wanting to go for a walk and the buy one get one free meal we decided to walk here after working out and get some dinner.
__label__2	Giant space and good tap list, but both good and drinks took forever to come out, the server was nice but only checked on out large group a few times over the course two hours, and the food was hit or miss. Only come if your already in the neighborhood and want to grab a drink (and order from the bar)
__label__2	Realizing staff is mostly high school kids, i gave 2 stars because of service...but owner needs to better staff.  Wait times to even be served, even on slowest of nights is bad to lousy. Most recent visit, 7:30p on a Friday- ONE person working counter on a Friday!! Saw FOUR cars get served thru drive thru while i was still #2 in line inside....left.  $20+ lost
__label__2	Was highly disappointed on my last two visits here.  I was looking for a particular fabric I was certain they would have; only had 3 rolls in stock, on clearance, all black.  Customer service rep was non-existent for questions both times I came here (within 3 weeks of each other).  Not sure I'll return.
__label__2	I know good Greek food, I've been to Tarpon Springs many times and that's good Greek food out there!  This place was just ok, nothing special, and quite frankly their prices were a bit high.
__label__2	Good meal. Sort of odd, slightly edgy and impersonal service that you might have to expect in a tourist filled area. They seem more than a little over it. I'd say 16 bucks for my very good plate was over priced. But not complaining. I had the Uncle Jazz Fest meal. Very good. And solid espresso. The rules contract on the table was just odd. And the place is a little dark, in case you are someone who likes sun.
__label__2	Low margin needs high volume, so maybe that's why every Trader Joe's seems to be in a strip mall near the corner of Road Rage and Crazy Drive. But the thing that really got me re-evaluating this TJ was the condition of the fruit on Friday. Four or five measly pineapples left. A bag of oranges with a rotten one at the bottom. More than a few fruit flies.  Two associates were giving plenty of attention to organizing the wine section. Buy a couple bottles to soak the fruit in, and you may be safe.
__label__2	Restaurant was practically empty but service was very slow. Ceilings were covered in dust and tables were not clean.
__label__2	Stopped by Lipkin's bakery today Sunday, 7-24-16 at 4:10 PM.  The door was locked with two salespersons inside which ignored  me and 3 other customers. The website states they are opened from 7 AM to 5 PM.  The schedule on the door states 7AM to 4:30 PM.  Get your act together.   I WILL NOT purchase from Lipkin's in the future
__label__2	Place is a rip off! Large pizzas the size of anyone else's small. Cheesesteaks have no meat. Deliver charge is higher than anyone less than a mile from home. Only thing this place has good are their rolls.
__label__2	Really disappointed by the food here. I ordered the ultimate bowl and it was essentially huge pieces of onion, pepper, and carrot almost raw. My partner ordered the ramen, also just had the same veg in there.... kind of bland all around. The sushi is good, I'm assuming stick to the sushi if you eat here.
__label__2	Bob Seeger put on a great show. Bankers Life Fieldhouse is the worst venue for a concert there is. All music has so much echo that nothing sounds good. Glad the tickets were free.
__label__2	"We're locals so I'm not sure why we even went! Maybe the thought of watching the ocean with our two year old suckered us in! I had a Bloody Mary that was so spicy I had to have more tomato juice added, after it wS added it was flavorless. So either to spicy or no flavor. My husbands blood orange margarita was more martini style and less like a margarita. 

We ordered the harbor platter. It was fine. The service was rushed. Overall the meal was so so and nothing was worth the 65.00 bill. Would have been better off going to chat west."
__label__2	"Went in for a gift card, thats it. 

Staff seemed to be a combination of frazzled and lazy when helping all 3 patrons inside the store. Took way too long just to make a purchase when there appeared to be plenty of staff on."
__label__2	"Seeing all the positive reviews we had to try. What a huge disappointment  Ordered the Eggs Benedict like I always do at a new place we try... HORRIBLE!!! No flavor, the ""ham"" was sliced lunch meat and the bread they put it on was tasteless. The Hollandaise sauce was thin and no flavor at all .... water that is what it was. My husband got the Bacado and he liked it. His multi grain bread was yummy. Clean and very nice staff."
__label__2	Very average. Orange beef just one big glop all stuck together, tasted okay. No option to order diet soda when ordering online.  I mentioned this in the notes when placing the order, still I received regular Coke.  It seems to be getting harder and harder to find a Chinese restaurant.that is trying to kick it up a notch.
__label__2	"You get what you pay for here. Off airport rental (which is a pain when there are several on site companies). The car they gave me had a faulty AC system which caused a loud noise when it turned left and leaking on the shoes of my passenger. They refunded 1 days cost for this. 

Short is I wasn't happy with the experience here and would rather pay more for better service. I recommend you do to!"
__label__2	If you enjoy waiting in line for 30 minutes this place is great. Unfortunately, this is the closest hobby lobby to my house. Customer service is awful and if you don't have your receipt it's a pain in the behind. As an etsy shop owner I find myself here frequently but prefer joanne fabrics or micheals if possible. Also this is the only craft store that only lets you use one coupon per visit.
__label__2	Not quite the deal for the price. The pulled pork was good...not the best. The sides were not good. The beans were so-so, the Mac and Cheese tasted like it was cooked at 6am, and the cole slaw was not worth the price. We were hoping for a good BBQ close to our house, but this is not it.
__label__2	Always have enjoyed the food but the new waitresses are unorganized and slow. Last visit it took 20 minutes to get drinks although it wasn't busy. She could see us sitting as she cleaned a table inside next to many empty and clean tables. Poor priorities. Loved the waitresses that worked there a few months ago, only see one left.
__label__2	"I went on a Saturday, walked in and immediately greeted. I asked for a basic gel pedicure & basic manicure. 

She made my nails so short. I asked for them to be slightly filed down, there's no consistency with the shape, I have paint on my skin & maybe 7 layers of polish. I would have scored one additional star if I wasn't there for 2.5 hours. 

The tech has passion for her craft, unfortunately I do not. 

The cost was $50 for a gel pedicure & $35 for the manicure; one color with no design work."
__label__2	I came here for lunch, and had the oyster poboy along with a half dozen oysters.  There was seriously nothing to write home about.  This place is way over-hyped.  I was very disappointed with the mediocre cocktail sauce served with my oysters, and immediately after my half dozen here, I went to Felix's and had a half dozen there...Acme's oysters paled in comparison to those available at Felix's.
__label__2	Went here for the first time Friday. I ordered ahead of time I get there 2 men at the counter one walked to the back the other stayed at the counter Let's get to the food NOT good very salty dumplings were very sweet! Ordered curry goat and it was very fatty no meat really. Didn't eat much had to dump it. First and last time.
__label__2	The ice cream was pretty good and it was fun to watch and thats the only reason it's getting two stars. There is a small fish tank with 8 big fish, no rocks or plants. It looked like it hadn't been cleaned ever. The smell of the tank masked throughout the store and my boba drink even tasted like the smell of a dirty fish tank i just threw it away.
__label__2	"Note to self...
1. No cars in the parking means turn around and go somewhere else 
2. Only customers in the restaurant means turn around and go somewhere else 
3. Hearing the blender after ordering margaritas means turn around and go somewhere else 
4. Extremely low lights in the restroom means turn around and go somewhere else 

The only thing that was a positive was that our waitress was sweet and polite and the bill was zero."
__label__2	This is mediocre Chinese food. I got the General tsos chicken and was not impressed. It just tasted not fresh and chemically. Would not recommend
__label__2	Don't order your food to go, they will forget to include items you've ordered and have paid for. This isn't the first time either.
__label__2	The first impression when we got there: smells like old dirty carpet. First I thought it was just in the waiting hall but it remained even when we were seated. Although the food was great, the smell killed my appetite. Also, the drink menu was all sticky and disgusting. Sangria felt like it was mix of ice and syrup only. I must say, the staff was fantastic - very thoughtful, kind and helpful!!
__label__2	Visiting and we had high hopes for this place. Chicken nachos were good and we also ordered wings which were disgusting and we likely got sick from them. The 2 stars is for the nice waitress we had and the drinks!
__label__2	My kids were members. I say were. Management isn't the best. The workers who are there ignore the teens doing wrong but hover over the younger kids. It's just too much. I gave 2 stars because my kids love it but it's too stressful and policed for me to take them there anymore. Playgrounds are free and they can run and jump all they want without being told no.
__label__2	Wanted to love this place so bad so I went real simple: hummus with cous cous. Neither had any taste whatsoever, even the chips that came with the hummus. Don't understand how you can mess up chickpeas...
__label__2	I've read some really good reviews on this place and have come to the conclusion that everyone was intoxicated when they ate here. The food was okay. The spinach is frozen not fresh which is absurd considering there's a produce store literally 100 feet away. The omelet was 10% egg 90% vegetable which is weird. Whatever, I'm stealing the hot sauce (just kidding) and never going back.
__label__2	Bread is not bad or donuts but cookies were stale and baked about a week old. May return for the Bread.
__label__2	"Boo to the Hilton Garden Inn for recommending this place with great enthusiasm. ""Mediocre"" does this place too much justice. I really think I could have made a better breakfast in my hotel room, using the microwave. If the Dutch Eating Place had been open on Sunday, we would have gone there and not been subjected to this boring diner."
__label__2	I used to go there couple times and love their donut- blueberry fritter whenever I go there. However, I ordered bacon maple donut today and with a first bite, I hate it. It tasted greasy with oil on my hand and the cream inside is unlikeable. I understand donuts are deep fried in oil but with these much of oil I can squeeze from a donut I am eating, it is not good to eat. My stomach got bloated from a bite. Not going to eat them like I used to or going bAck
__label__2	Only eating here because of hurricane sandy .... Kill me
__label__2	The only good thing was the salad.  Food was over cooked and over salted. Service was bad.  I wouldn't reccomend it at all.
__label__2	Okay seriously why is this place so small? I expected a huge farmers market, but it was incredibly tiny. There's basically three sections the fruits and veggies, the plants and an inside portion of restaurants. It needs to be double the size, just not enough to keep you entertained.
__label__2	I came here all the time now I'm done with them they are not very warm and don't say much do pedicure to quick they are horrible and very rude ellie is the worst one
__label__2	I only went once, so take review with grain of salt. I was surprised at the prices, especially since the coffee and pastries I got were just so-so. I'd be willing to try again perhaps, but I'm definitely not aching to go back.
__label__2	We wanted to like this place but you don't always get what you want.  We like supporting local so we tried it out.  The food was average at best.  If I am going to eat at a restaurant I want the food to be at least as good as I can make myself and it just missed the mark.  Based on the few other reviews I would have to assume they are friends or family trying to boost the business.
__label__2	"The furniture was reasonably priced but took several months to ship.  Unfortunately the warehouse forgot to put felt protectors on the truck.  I went out after the delivery and I bought my own felt. When I called back after the delivery to get them to stop by and place them on the sofa legs, the customer service agent said I would have to return the sofa!  What?

Such nonsense.  I expected better from Macys."
__label__2	"Go to the buffet just before noon. Two pizzas out, with single vegetable toppings only. A single serving of pasta. Thought was early so waited a bit. 12:15 put out a desert pizza. Pasta is empty. 12:25 put out another pizza, this time half pepperoni.
Had to ask for a salad, but was never offered.
One glass of soda and never offered to have it refilled.
Like the old place on Veale Road in Wilmington, this place is on the decline."
__label__2	Kensington was out of meat they only buy one cow a week according to the waiter. Burger was good but very skimpy amount of potatoes. They also charge for bread even know we had salad and ravioli too. Won't be back and suspect they won't be around for long.
__label__2	So I'm only going to rate what I ate since this place has good reviews for other food choices but I got the chicken biscuit sandwich and mac & cheese. I can tell you that the chicken patty was pre-formed had a few spices on it and dipped in hot sauce. The biscuit was bland falling apart and didn't have much flavor.  The mac and cheese was so so.  You might do OK with the barbecue but I regret not  getting any because it might've been better based on the other reviews but I can definitely say stay away from the chicken biscuit.
__label__2	Out of honey mustard dressing and out of almost every drink including lemonade, diet Pepsi, rootbeer and mis. Got a 3 piece tenders, tater tots and a honey butter chicken sandwich. The toys were cold and one of the three tenders was completely cartridge and hard. The only reason I'm giving 2 stars was because the staff was so nice and friendly.
__label__2	"I'm not crazy about Red Door East.  

In fact, I've never stayed there for more than just one drink.  There's not a lot of room to move around, so getting to the bar is a chore when they're busy.  Maybe I should go earlier in the day?  And although the porch is wonderful, they do not allow dogs on said porch - which should be illegal in East Nashville."
__label__2	Visited Philly this past weekend.  One gotta try a PCS in Philly, right?  Since we saw this place on TV and all over the tourist brochures, we decided to give it a try.  Customer service was nonexistent.  The sandwich was good, not greasy, not dry, just plain good, but not great.  On a side note, how come everybody in South Philly park on top of each other?  We left feeling like we totally fell for the tourist trap.  Totally overrated.
__label__2	"We ordered macchiatos and we were served espresso mixed with hot water instead of espresso with a splash of steamed milk. We questioned the bartender but he told us he was right. We did not want to argue but this is definitely wrong. Please learn the correct coffee preparation if you are going to charge $3.50 per cup. 

The bombolini was good. The service was good."
__label__2	Not that impressed. IG pictures looked great but the food wasn't the best . Lobster Mac & cheese we had to send back to be warmed up, came to the table cold along with wings. We all agreed the waitress was great and accommodating. I would only come back for the milkshakes they are Best !
__label__2	Take everything that sucks about San Antonio (Riverwalk, bad restaurants, tourist overload, smells) and put it all under a glass roof in Nashville. Voila, Gaylord Opryland.
__label__2	Beautiful but overpriced,  and very high calorie. Food was ok. Limited menu. Seems very popular though.
__label__2	We came in for breakfast and ordered eggs. The eggs were under cooked and not once did the waitress come around to ask us if we wanted a refill on our coffee. On top of that the food is way overpriced. Disappointing.
__label__2	Next time plan to make enough BBQ pork, chicken, beef, ribs for a Sunday night crowd to get past 6pm. Thanks for the let down. The tip off should have been when the sign in front is looking for new staff. Don't know what is going on at this location.
__label__2	These aren't the worst bagels I've had, but definitely not the best. Not nearly chewy enough. The concept of a bagel food truck is amazing and the staff seemed great, but the actual bagel really failed to deliver.
__label__2	Such small portions! I wanted to get a Po Boy down the street minutes after I finished my breakfast here. :(
__label__2	"Why are the main restrooms  for women locked? All morning.   Cmon guys, I know u can do better. 

It's a bit rushed to figure out which gate n track the Amtrack train is on. If u miss the announcement,  which is hard to understand,  u could miss ur train. It's very rushed also. 

Come on, Philly. I know ur better than that. U know ur better than that. I believe in u. Get with it."
__label__2	Slowest service.  Small space.  Indifferent  staff.  Drink quality inconsistent....in other words I've had better.
__label__2	"Jambalaya was not good and the fried catfish Napoleon (highly recommended by the server) was undercooked and mushy. Looked great on the outside but was too
Soft for catfish. I have eaten catfish my entire life, but never cooked that way. Not good at all."
__label__2	"Chile rellenos in the Tucson Area rated according to the Homeland Security Advisory System with three word descriptors.

__label__2	"They straight up don't answer the phone, ever. This was the 3rd time this year I've tried calling this place. 

Menu looks great! But I don't have time to play phone tag with any food places when we are hungry"
__label__2	Meeh, strombolli had no extras, all cheese and cheese and more cheese... add more layers inside, lameo, ive been around from LA to Miami and this was soggy with no perks... service great but strombolli lacking... weak
__label__2	Food handlers are not required to wear gloves, to the contrary Health Depts. require food handlers to wash hands frequently. Gloves are required if a handler has a cut or open sore. Gloves can get just as dirty as hands and can cause cross contamination.
__label__2	My family and I have been here a few times and won't be back anymore. The quality of the food isn't worth the price they charge and the last time we were they I ended up getting sick. The wait staff is t that great either, our drinks sat empty for quite some time on each visit and the waiters and waitresses don't frequent your table, even when they aren't busy
__label__2	Someone needs to teach these guys how to make a Rueben. Worst I have ever eaten. If rest of sandwiches are the same I will not be back!
__label__2	"Stay away. The course is below Sea Level and gets flooded all the time. Of course people ignore the rules and drive on the course, ruining the fairways. 

This place is cheap and is perfect to take a novice or someone just picking up the game."
__label__2	The greasiest blandest burger I have ever had. Would not come back. The fries were good though.
__label__2	Ended up buying from innervision because they carried the frame we wanted at a reasonable price.  The quality didn't meet our expectations and the majority of the staff did not provide good customer service.
__label__2	Ordered shrimps and grits to go. Got home hungry, only to be disappointed when I opened the box. Tiny shrimps were served. On their menu, shrimp and grits show jumbo shrimp. Called to ask. The answer was that for lunch the shrimp is small. This isn't showed on their menu. Grits were fine. Nothing great.
__label__2	"watch out for the soups they are loaded with oil and butter!!
the mixed salad personnel are sometimes rude and have real no clue how some of the food is prepared!
all the checkers are fabulous!!!
everyone in produce are extremely helpful!!!
sushi wrappers are so nice!!
pizza and prepared dinners run the line like a cafeteria!! such a put off!!
wine area very small and closed in!!
cheese guys are very kewl!!
denise in the bakery is a genus!!"
__label__2	"Fast food in 45 minutes, serve it cold and ""burnt"" or at least over cooked and you have our Lunch.   Good luck eating there.  I hope it is better when you eat there."
__label__2	"i had their ""dark roux"" gumbo at the Treme Creole Gumbo Festival and (1) the roux was not dark, and (2) it wasn't that good.  i happen to particularly like a dark roux and all the flavor that entails, so it was a letdown to get their gumbo whose roux wasn't even borderline dark.  also, there was no depth or development of flavor, and the meat was bland.  no thanks."
__label__2	The technicians were great however I'm disappointed to have spent $100 on a mani pedi when my mani only lasted about 3 hours. 3 hours later I chipped a couple nails because I let the receptionist talk me out of shellac. I had requested shellac in the notes section which they didn't read and then told me that shellac doesn't last that long anyway and that they had another brand of regular polish that was similar to gel so I went with that. Won't return.
__label__2	The patio is great, but that was the high point of this restaurant. Service was uncoordinated with dishes arriving a few minutes apart as they forgot about one of our orders. Seems they are focused on being quick instead of a more thoughtful customer experience. Edamame was under-salted and the sushi was average.
__label__2	Ordered stromboli's here three times, three separate times and disgusted to say that EACH one had hair in it. Called to talk to anyone about it and there was no one who would assist me. Loved their food otherwise else, just disappointed in the quality.
__label__2	its ok not much flavor we like juice it up better and they are cheaper we most likely wont be coming back
__label__2	Brought a suit and 3 dress shirts,. Suit was nice untll i noticed on the pants a big patch of dog hair light colored l ike b a lab or something, started to look at jacket and had a big patch of bog hair on it also on the back. I had 3 full button up shirts and all were wrinkled fron 3rd button up , it was like a steam press wrinkle there to stay. I will not go back and i will NOT recommended.
__label__2	U can cook a better Tom Yum using the spices u bought from superstore, this place is absolutely a bad choice to me.
__label__2	I don't expect fine dining here, but I would like consistent, decent food with good service.  We have experienced issues the last 2 times we visited and may not be back.  One reason we specifically go there is that they offer a fairly substantial gluten free menu.  Today (Sunday at 11am) they were out of gluten free bread and offered me regular bread as a substitute.  Seriously!? One party close to us were told the restaurant was also out of granola.  Another party returned their entire huevos rancheros order because it was so gross and mis-prepared.
__label__2	My phone got water damaged and I brought it to get it fixed. It was in within the first 24 hours and I did everything according to what their website said. I paid to have him look at it only to have to call back 2 times within the next 3 days and him say nothing could be done, leaving me out of the very high diagnostic fee and saddled with a broken phone. He made no effort to contact me about pickup or phone status even though I had paid for emergency rates and had been assured I would receive a call the next day.
__label__2	"Meh. I work right down the street and have come here a few times for lunch or a post work drink. 

Chills food is always disappointing. I had to send back guac and chips because it tasted like the guac was made days ago and shipped to the store (which I'm sure if was)
Their drinks are usually a bit overpriced.  For instance last night I paid $4 for a Miller 64 
I wouldn't come back here unless I was dragged here by a group of friends..."
__label__2	Food was ok but cold.  We shared a big daddy -the beef brisket and ribs were good but the turkey and pulled pork were dry.  The guy who prepared our order was rude and condescending when we asked what he suggested for us.  It is our first time in St Louis and wanted to experience their version of BBQ.  I wouldn't go back to this place.
__label__2	Im going to agree with the other mediocre reviews and say that I ate here today and it wasn't good. I got chicken parm which is a pretty easy dish, the portion and ingredients were there but it just didn't taste right. The chicken was chewy, either fatty or undercooked I'm not sure which. Not real Italian I would go elsewhere in the future.
__label__2	Ehh.. I dont get the hype. My wife and I went for a weekday dinner. Nice waitstaff and all but food was meh. Glorified diner food not worth the price. Maybe i caught em on an off night...everything took forrrrreeeeevvvveeerrrrr to come out.. And thats not why im giving the bad review..food just wasnt very good...and i HATE fries that are as big as my fingernail. Like i get all the crumbs.
__label__2	"Wanted to try someplace new and were hungry for Chinese.  We found this restaurant on Yelp and decided to give it a try.  We have our favorites in Edwardville, but didn't want to go that far, so we chose New China.  Very average quality Chinese food.  
Had the Chicken fried rice and pot stickers.  Pot stickers were very doughy.  Fried rice was just ok.  Probably won't be back."
__label__2	"The only reason this place received two stars is because of a few of the servers who were really nice. The food was under seasoned and too sweet. I bought fried chicken wings, Mac n cheese, green beans, and peach cobbler. Everything including the mac n cheese was way too sweet...horrible!!! Some of the money being used to open up new restaurants around  the country should be spent on remodeling, and cleaning up this disgusting place. I was so disappointed and will never visit any of her ""cafeterias"" again!"
__label__2	"Great potential - Fantastic beer selection, staff and the sexy fries are amazing. The food menu often feels stale and quality is often lacking, so we choose Skippack the majority of the time. 

Revamp the menu, invest in a new chef and the options are limitless!!"
__label__2	Stay away from room 349 at this hotel. This room is noisy all night long. I thought it was the air/heating unit; however I turned it off and still heard the machinery type noise. If you want a restful nights sleep do not accept and pay for this room or the rooms in hallway of 349.
__label__2	Boring.  Average service, lackluster food.  The restaurant was very warm (on a very warm day) and the call ahead system was inaccurate.
__label__2	"Gel mani was awful! Uneven filing, never soaked my hands or clipped my cuticles. Nails have hard edges and polished peeled on day 3!

The reason for the 2 was the great pedicure. And only because I paid the extra $10 for the spa pedi. My girlfriend got the regular pedi and her nails looked awful. 

Place is beautiful, but not very friendly and paying before you receive service is a bit strange."
__label__2	Terrible tasting rice and chicken. Rice was more like a mush, and chicken was bland. Would not come again.
__label__2	The ambiance was, um, lots of bright overhead lighting. Nice service and management.  The main problem was that the food was totally uninspired and poorly flavored.
__label__2	"This place was great until they got money hungry. I spent 13$ on a burrito, rice and cheese dip. Terrible portions 
Very sad 
Food taste good but not a good value at all"
__label__2	Beware: Attendant is almost impossible to communicate with unless you speak Cantonese; if you put your coins in before your clothes and the washer starts up, it's locked and they won't refund your $.
__label__2	I've tried to give them the benefit of the doubt since they do have an excellent broth for the pho but it's ruined by  what seems they pre cook the noodles. That being said going back to their service; it is very poor, they don't acknowledge you when you enter the restaurant and when they do it seems like you're an inconvenience. While we were there another person walked in with their son and had to retrieve their own menu. It is truly unfortunate for their lack of professionalism as this place has potential.
__label__2	The food here was lukewarm. It's super busy . I wouldn't come back  I like piping hot food where it's burning my mouth
__label__2	Neat concept, but WAAAY overpriced for what you get. I'll go to Red Robin next time. More for your money. Plus the burger has very little flavor. Bun is weird, and bbq sauce is tame. No oomph! Too bad.
__label__2	Really unfortunate experience here...had friends visiting from out of town and wanted to introduce them to the delicious mojo bowl. Waited 15-20 minutes and didn't even have a waiter come by the table. After reminding the hostess that we were still waiting for a server, 10 more minutes passed with nothing, so we left. For context, it was not crowded. This was the second time I've been to this establishment and they are 0 for 2 in the service department.
__label__2	The ambiance was great and the coffee was spectacular. However, it appeared that there was miscommunication between the staff on several occasion. Additionally food came out cold and there was little flavor to everything. Not sure will go again.
__label__2	"Yelp 100 Challenge 2019 #7
Went to a conference here - they provide decent spaces and food.
Service was okay.

But the casino portion, oh my, I just couldn't get over the smell and how dirty and old it felt. I do not recommend this place as a casino or place to hang out.  I would only go because of the conference.

If you have to go to a restaurant, I recommend the Oyster Bar."
__label__2	Bar folk offended  I mentioned Anthony Bourdain, and cut me off without stating to me they thought me offensive. Your inexperienced staff exhibited awful etiquette. After 15 years I will never go back.
__label__2	"I walked in and was immediately disappointed. The speakeasy thing is a good idea, but this one was executed in a way that was just too Steven Starr. It was crowded, and the crowd was clearly a little more focused on looking swanky than enjoying a well-poured cocktail.

I should mention that I am something of a bar and cocktail snob. I judge a place by the quality of its ice, so don't listen to me. The more people who go here, the shorter the line at Franklin, so by all means, go to Ranstead Room RIGHT NOW."
__label__2	Worst experience I've had at a restaurant. Servers were crude became we came so close to closing. The hostess told us over the phone it was ok. Worst shrimp I've ever had obviously frozen and reminds me why I don't eat in Jefferson parish/Kenner
__label__2	Always a huge disappointment, I have no idea why I keep going back. Their buffalo chips and BBQ sauces are good, but that's about all that is good. Had the BBQ pork sandwich and it had a huge chunk of fat it it. Asked for a new one and the second one was dried out. Dickeys is a far superior BBQ joint and much better priced too.
__label__2	The place and service are fine.  The food on the other hand.  Seriously 4 1/2, I don't think so.  The gyro is so bland and the quality of the meat is average at best.  The salad shirazi was so salty I couldn't believe it.  Go to an authentic Persian restaurant if you want real salad shirazi.  Good luck guys but this food was not acceptable.
__label__2	The worst pineapple curry I've literally ever had and I've had a ton. The red base was yellow/orange and watery; had no flavor other than red pepper flakes (which I hate). I asked for mild mild like NO spice- I almost threw up it was so spicy. One server and she was busyyy. She's the only reason I gave 2 stars. Very apologetic and nice; discounted my meal since I ate 2 bites and got sick. Yuck :(
__label__2	Had issues with my room, the staff were unapologetic. I've made numerous calls to the Resort to see what they can do to remedy the situation, but have not heard back. I'm very disappointed with my last stay at GSR, and I've stayed here many times.
__label__2	Horrible place, horrible bartender. Shitty food and Joe was horrrible. Kept trying to get us to leave, we were just trying to get a drink
__label__2	"This place is so mediocre. I think the only reason it was so crowded is because there are only 1-2 other restaurants around. We went there for dinner. Spinach artichoke was a thick layer of mozzarella cheese with some cream cheese with flecks of spinach underneath. Fish tacos soggy, spinach salad with ""hot bacon dressing"" was covered in a mustard vinaigrette and funky tasting chicken. Seriously, disappointing."
__label__2	I have had pedicures at River Nails for the last few years.  I was always really happy until my last pedicure on Sept. 12.  The staff didn't seem to know that I had an appointment. There were two people who did part of the pedicure-- a female and a male. I had to tell the female to trim my toenails although that should be part of the process and she cut one of my toes.  Also, the pedicure station leaked and got my shoes really wet.  Unfortunately, I won't be going back.
__label__2	"Advertised as a ""boutique"" hotel. Boutique must mean old. Small rooms and outdated fixtures. No problem with small rooms if they are decorated nicely and bathrooms are updated somewhat. Frankly, the rooms look like a Motel 6..  housekeeping appears lacking with dirt buildup on the carpet in the corners of the room."
__label__2	I work in the shopping center where this is located. You are right it gets crazy at lunch! The line is out the door and it's just salad ... Expensive salad .all salads come with a white or a wheat roll. The best thing I like is the soups! Delicious especially if you are like me and like soups. They have grilled sandwiches that are delicious . Hmm .. Seems like I like the sandwiches and the soups more then the salads! I guess I do. Hey give it a try , the staff is very nice.

__label__2	A bit disappointing for a 2nd time. The lamb wasn't served with a sauce & was over cooked. The grape leaves are dry. And I ordered rice but got some strange pickle & pepper side.
__label__2	Yelp removed my original review. Service is unfriendly and elitist. Won't be returning nor recommending.
__label__2	First time at chipotle I got a burrito it was good but never get the brown rice it has a lettuce pieces that is horrible but the food is ok
__label__2	Disorganized service. Fair Bar and Convenient Neighborhood food however this place is dirty and has poor food handling. No improvements in years. Servers touch your food, Cooks / Employees smoke Cigarettes outside of both buildings at the doors of the restaurant and then immediately go to make your food without washing their hands.  Not good. Owner Just doesn't care.
__label__2	stopped in for a few slices. pizza was not so good. and only 1 table inside, so it's definitely a takeout place.
__label__2	We thought this was silly. There were only about five stories and we would have enjoyed seeing more sights. We were brought to a bar about halfway through the walk. There are plenty of bars in New Orleans and it wasn't necessary to make this part of a phantom tour.
__label__2	The food was ok, but unfortunately, price was deceiving. We were family of four, and the final cost of the food for all of us was about $17 more than we thought it was going to be. We found out that they raised price of each good items but that's not indicated on the menu so you have no idea how much you are spending on your food until you get the final bill. I'm sorry but I don't like the way they do business. We felt very deceived when we left.
__label__2	"The high lights are the old rasputin porter, and the jalapeño bacon poppers..
Service was spotty and my appetize,beer and dinner came all the same time..cold food :-(

The pretzel bratwurst. .I didn't like...and I love brats and pretzels. .
So loud you can't think..very dark..not much lights..
This is a place for college kids..misses the mark for us older folks"
__label__2	"Food was meh, service was good other than the hostess at the front, and prices were pretty high. It is Nashville so I understand it'll be a bit higher, but the food wasn't very good... So less understanding lol. 
Tonkotsu ramen : awful, hard noodles, decent broth, decent egg, dry pork
Gyoza: fairly good taste, too much dough
Yakitori: decent taste overall.. wagyu was pretty good, pork belly was a disappointment."
__label__2	"Visiting NoLA with the wife foe Mardi Gras. Sorry, but food is not good at all. Presentation is amazing, staff is very friendly and welcoming, but food lacked flavor. I wish we didn't waste the 60.00 spent for breakfast (we had mimosas though). 

Our best part of the experience was our waitor, James I believe his name was. He was amazing, new the menu well, and was very attentive. Love him but I doubt we would return."
__label__2	This place is conveniently located at two major road s but it is very difficult to get in and out of the parking lot.  The servers seemed nice enough but I thought it was overpriced for it being a diner for the amount of food I got on my loaded fries and Asian chicken salad.  It was worth a try so I have no regrets, especially as the kids enjoyed themselves.
__label__2	The food is great but the service is reliable terrible!  Have been there 3 times and two out of the 3 times the server just walked away.  I just gave up and won't be returning!
__label__2	"Terrible service - asked two people where to find something just to get reprimanded for asking... the lady literally said 'no you cannot ask me a question' twice when she was walking back and forth. If it wasn't for being the closest wine store in the area near our apartments, I would go elsewhere. 

Other than that, location is good and wine selection is decent. They even have soju (korean sake) in the back for cheap."
__label__2	Service is not the best. Waited 40min to be seated. Waited an additional 1hr to get food (restaurant was not packed) this changed our plans as it delayed us .. also keeping building clean is not a priority. Bathroom was really filthy, tables left a mess from previous people.
__label__2	Went back here because I had to use some gift cards someone gave to me. The service was much better this time. It was attentive and quick. However, the food was still barely worth eating.
__label__2	I ordered the BBQ combo plate. The meat and sauce were ok, but the sides were disappointing. Half my food was cold. I then ordered the apple pie per the server's recommendation. The pie was not fresh and it was also brought out cold. Service staff is friendly and knowledgable. Atmosphere is great. Food is just ok.
__label__2	One word: Bland. Actually two words: Extremely bland. On a positive note, the food seems healthy. Not overly salty, or oily. But zero flavor. Blah! They tend to serve an older crowd, which explains the lack of flavor. Older people tend to not like any real spices.
__label__2	I've been here two times since it changed from wing-stop and both times I've told myself I wouldn't go back. Both times my order has been wrong. The first time I took the wings back to get the order fixed and they messed it up again. I just don't see how wings can be so complicated.
__label__2	Way to pricey for what you get foods ok but not worth the prices an I was with a big group an our food came out cold they could handle the group. Pools are great but you do pay a price for Cabana help an it has beautiful views but very strict on how many people are allowed to stay in penthouse for 10,000. I would let them know I would have anyone I want stay in my penthouse. Crazy
__label__2	Not upholding Covid rules. Felt uncomfortable picking up food. People walking around without masks and workers with masks below their noses. Do better.
__label__2	"First time getting food from Qdoba (delivered via GrubHub). I ordered 3 crispy beef tacos with guacamole, shredded cheese, pico de gallo, and Fiery Habanero sauce. 

I cannot understand, for the life of me, who decided to squeeze these 3 tacos into a small SALAD bowl. The tacos barely fit in there, the toppings had spilled out into this already tight space, and because of the odd packaging, made the tacos a soggy mess. If I wanted soft tacos, that's what I would have ordered. Sheesh."
__label__2	"Came in for lunch, one person doing everything. Seems to only be able to cook one thing at a time. 
People called in for take out as well as others on line for take out. 
Long wait, very long wait... unfortunately I paid in advance or I would leave. I understand his assistant didn't show up today...
He is doing the best he can, but still a long wait...
I'm out of time.  

Small business. People like the owner and I agree with them. 
Will give him another chance, soon ."
__label__2	"The dinner cruise is nice but I don't recommend the birthday package. We had to ask the waiter twice about the ""free"" bottle included and cake that ended up being a plain white cake from Publix. The atmosphere is for older people with an oldies dance party after sunset. The food was overpriced, the shrimp was tough and stale. Overall, the experience is only good if you are retired and have nothing better to do"
__label__2	Maybe I am just a scrooge, but this place is terrible.  The games cost a fortune, the food stinks and the beer tastes watered down.  I would have loved it when I was 13, but as an adult this place sucks.
__label__2	Mediocre sushi, the habachi portion is big enough for a 2 year old, and the water taste like dish water.  Will not be back.  Our server was nice and the ice cream was good.
__label__2	Mac's had no meat..salad with meat had hardly any meat too.   Drinks not very strong.  Kids running the place..not great service.  Never again.
__label__2	"The Good : Very nice clean park with friendly manager.  
The Bad :   I was told how to connect to the internet, but where we were located the signal was
                  to weak to connect.  Cable TV wasn't working as well.  

It was ok for one night, but would not stay there again.  Don Titus"
__label__2	"Where's the Cheese!!! I order the Vegetarian Pizza.
there wasn't nany flavor; vegees soggy & cold; got back to work and heated it up but wasn't any better; so I ate a piece of cheese and crackers so I would not go hunger; will have to toss or donate.
I was hoping it would be good by the reviews. Maybe a bad day!"
__label__2	"The food quantity was good, but the meats were all bland. They don't have many sauces like other kbbq do.  They have all you can eat and the first round of meats were able to take to-go if you can't finish it. 
We had to ask them come replace our grill grate because it was burnt. They have a call button so it wasn't that big of a deal. Everything was incredibly expensive, which is fine for dinner, but the quality was not good, and they don't have much selection."
__label__2	Store seemed nice- but the hours are incorrect. Door was locked before 8pm and says it closes Mon-Fri at 9pm.....
__label__2	Gimme a break guys.  The food and drinks weren't bad, but the prices in no way reflect what they're serving.
__label__2	Tried this location the day after having Acme's chargrilled oysters (Unbelievably amazing) Unfortunately, I was really disappointed with Drago's version. The gumbo was average and l the chargrilled oysters did not meet the hype of food network reviewers. The topping tasted like warmed imitation butter with no flavor and wet breading. All the fire and flames made a good show for atmosphere, but they didn't actual add to the flavor of the food.
__label__2	"The awful awful is a slightly better version of the Big Mac.

Sorry, but its true. Yeah you get a TON of fries with it, and the ambience in the place is a pretty fun dive (complete with tons of drunks). But I had to wait FOREVER for this thing...and it wasnt even that busy.

Ill stick to In N Out or five guys as the best fast food style burgers."
__label__2	"OK, as before dinner is and has always been better than standard joints of this type.
But not as always the service was fair to poor this time, and it is not crowded today. For a Sunday evening at 6 Pm,  it's surprising but as I stated the service is not as good as it has been.
Also please add a sugar free Something for dessert. 
Ice cream, Jello or something. 
A.lot.of Gluten-free options but come on, it's the 21st century get with the times people..."
__label__2	"$25 gel manicure... Get what ya pay for? Crappy job. 
 
Ugh. Seriously, is there not ANYWHERE in PHilly that does a great job with nails, It's not too expensive, it's a cute and clean nail spot, and the people are nice and friendly?!

After living here for two years I know the answer to that question."
__label__2	"I tried liking this place but they are a mess.  1x I went in and their cashier was sitting on counter.
Another time 2 employees were making out in storage closet with it open. 
1 day they'll give me 2 stamps for 2 drinks another they give me 1 stamp for 2 drinks. 
The coffee itself is good so I do keep trying it. I do like to support small businesses."
__label__2	"Over priced, food is nothing special and some items not good at all, but service has been AWFUL!  Beer choices are nice but when you like something it's not there the next time you go. Really disappointed because I live close and was REALLY looking forward to having a great ""go to"" place."
__label__2	"I lived near this place for several years. I ate here numerous times and after each visit hated the place more each time. The service is poor and stuffy. The food is not very good, bordering on ""barely ok"". This place defines greasy diner.  There are so many more places to eat on the beach, and you can only do better by driving past Gayles. Nearby are Beverley's and the Frog Pond which are both terrific.

You can do so much better on the beach!"
__label__2	If you want the focus to be on clipping and unclipping carabiners and ducking under wires, then this is the place for you! The work and attention required to safely get through the course with multiple connection points and tiny platforms made the experience of climbing and soaring through the trees less than ideal. I recommend getting shoulder harnesses, bigger landing platforms, a better landing area than a pile of mulch and continuous safety attachments throughout each segment.
__label__2	"The food is not even close to organic , the steak doesn't have any taste. Need to know how to cook Brussels but sprouts. I Wouldn'tnd recommend it if you are looking for something cool
It's a good bar though"
__label__2	We were here for Brunch. It was a hit and a miss. My Eggs Benedict with home fries was very good. My wife's vegetable soup was not good at all. Didn't even look appetizing. Should be taken off the menu. We complained about it when we left but they didn't offer a refund. Her egg  salad sandwich had no taste and had only a thin piece of lettuce on it. We will not be going back.
__label__2	First off, the staff was very friendly and helpful. None of the locks in our room locked; room, connecting room, or bathroom. The toilet ran all night and the pool had way too much chlorine. My wife wanted a bottle of water, but the cooler by the desk had broken handles, I had to pry it open. The only choices were water and root beer. Their snack counter only carried Cheetos. It seems with a Sam's club in the same parking lot, they could stock better. Disappointing stay, but the staff was great.
__label__2	Slowest Panera Ever. 20 minutes for 2 coffee drinks!? People with their food that were in line after me got their hot food before me. It's a shame the Panera is in a great location terrible service.
__label__2	Average food when we ate twice there. Tandoori too dry. Not fresh naan.
__label__2	Menus prices not correct. Child pasta does not include bread. At 6.25 plus 2.65 for bread. Stated 4.50. Not right prices on line.meatballs awful  salads usually good not good for kids.
__label__2	"Meh. 

It's good but over priced. The menu reads like a stationary food truck, with limited options. But, unlike a food truck, you don't have a captive audience so we expect more.  It's almost like they have an identity crisis. Should we be full service or fast Caz or food truck. 

Again the food is delicious if you want to pay almost $20 dollars for a drink, side, and sandwich. 

It ain't that delicious to me. Maybe they'll adapt. But, otherwise, I'm not going back."
__label__2	If you're on the hunt for some lukewarm food and find being ignored alluring, then boy, are you in luck! In all seriousness, I don't know how they did it but they successfully managed to cook all of our food to the exact same mildly (generous) warm temperate. Our server was nice, and did apologize for her lack of attentiveness, but it was clear she was over-seated (to no fault of her own). Overall, one star for being nice and one star for trying.
__label__2	Good service. Food sucks. Ordered ropa vieja (described as shredded beef), food that came out was 95% tomatoes, peppers, and onions - almost no beef at all. Wife ordered a sandwich, which had an almost comical amount of meat (comically small amount). If you want to eat meat, don't eat here. Thought the prices were reasonable, but now that I see what you get for your money, it's way overpriced too.
__label__2	"Unfortunately, this wasn't ""it"" for us. Both the mixed greens salad and Oyster BLT had dated/old produce (including peaches, avocado, lettuce and tomatoes that had dark spots and/or withered texture) and the oysters had an old cooking oil taste. For a $16 piece of toast, we'd expect fresh food? Just a thought. Our bill was over $75.00 and we could truly walk away saying we only enjoyed our Bellini and chocolate chip cookies."
__label__2	I love Pizza Hut pizza, but not from this location. I received a pizza that was under cooked in the middle. It was still mushy dough. When I left feedback on their online survey about this, I never heard back from them. I expected at least some acknowledgement, something I usually get from other food places. If they had reached out to apologize, then I would have given them a second chance. I go to the Domino's down the street now.
__label__2	Looked forward to this becoming a Barnes & Noble, but have not had much success here.  I have never had a question answered without being sent to three different people.  Most of the employees do not know what is in the store (weird, because it is a small store). I have been given  misinformation.  I have figured out how to park there (use the garage; they validate)  But I am pretty much done with this location.
__label__2	The shelves are organized in such a frustrating way. They're sectioned off into U shapes in the least intuitive way possible. I just want to walk down an aisle between rows of shelves to find the genre I'm looking for. Not navigate an entire maze.
__label__2	This place might be ok for beer, but is not great for food. Slow service, cold food, and the children's menu is not kid friendly flavors at all.
__label__2	The menudo was good but the carnitas were the worst I've ever had. The tables were all dirty and I could only spot on hot sauce bottle that wasn't empty but some
__label__2	"The inexplicable popularity of this place is proof positive that Edmonton needs more vegetarian restaurants. You don't need all that fake meat to make good vegetarian eats.

That said, the desserts are great."
__label__2	"We had the General and a shrimp dish and they were tolerable but it was the worst hot and sour soup ever. 

Food was fast but not appetizing. 

I really wanted to like this place."
__label__2	Sandwiches are super yummy! Doesn't taste like cheap lunchmeat either. HOWEVER, the second time I called, the person was extremely rude. Extremely! I don't know about this...
__label__2	Food is definitely not as described on menu, so don't expect it to be.  However some is tasty.  We went with a group and shared so I got to sample more things.  Nothing special. FOOD NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!!  Great atmosphere but location is in Providence so if you don't live there you have to fight the traffic going and leaving.
__label__2	"The receptionist jasmine was extremely rude.
She was sucking mints and kept saying I'm sorry with attitude and rolling her eyes
Not the first person you'd want to be greeted by
If you're having an issue
I've been coming to this office for a few years
Hopefully won't have to deal with her again"
__label__2	Do not trust the hours posted on the Yelp page they were not open at 10pm when we came by, and we thought they would be open since the Yelp page says they close at 2am. Just a heads up!
__label__2	I'm absolutely disgusted and very disappointed in Sonic. Especially today, which was Mother's Day, and even if we are in a pandemic-it isn't an excuse to make the tenders overly oily and gross. Along with the tater tots, it was wayy too salty and the toast was burnt. This has happened a couple of times but it has never been this bad, until today obviously. Out of everything I had ordered today, the only good thing that came out of it were the shakes and mozzarella sticks. Good job sonic .
__label__2	Just had dinner... table of 2... No major issues...Pastas and Apps all good...EXCEPT the $32.00 Fish special that was as flavorless and dry and over priced and a complete disaster that i would be embarrassed to be serving such a poor example of seafood and cooking ability . Server only said, Sorry, next time well do better.. I could go into serious detail...But , long story short...  That was BAD!
__label__2	Opens and closes whenever the hell it feels like it. Was closed at 3pm on a Monday.  No explanation on the door.
__label__2	Chicken and waffles  is a simple dish to make and  is not that easy to make bad, but some how they found away with that being said at best it was edible .I was highly disappointed  my chicken was over fried and under seasoned  and my waffle was  equal to a frozen Eggo waffle, but this waffle I will let go. I will not be back !!
__label__2	"The service was slow and it was hard to get our waitress's attention. The soup of the day, a creamy potato, tasted only like condensed milk and not much else. The ""mild"" chicken wings were so hot we couldn't finish them. The Manly Wedge with pulled pork was so salty I sent it back and did not want a replacement. The rotational IPA was terrible but I felt bad after returning my entree so I left it undrank. Prices are more steep than cheap. It's super loud. Only redeeming qualities are the cool atmosphere and some of the beers were decent."
__label__2	"Again, I go for a car wash during their normal posted business hours and they're not open. There was one person sitting there that looked like a worker but he never came to greet me. So I drove off.   They do a good job when they wash your car, but you never know when they're going to be open or closed
Once again. Saturday morning, sunny and a beautiful day. Opens and 9 and not a single person hear"
__label__2	I ordered a large cheese pizza to go.  The crust, cheese and sauce were good, but, not $20 good.   The box weighed more than the pizza.  If they made the cheese slices of fresh mozzarella any thinner they would disappear in the sauce.  There were so many red spots on the pie (meaning they were not covered with cheese) It was a rip-off.  I will not be back.
__label__2	This place was pretty run down, the food was decent enough. If your a strict vegetarian you have the freedom to order anything from the menu. I just couldn't get past the lack of cleanliness factor.
__label__2	Seems to be getting worse.  This was one of our favorite places until Saturday night.  They ran out of their signature beer, I ordered a $15 cheeseburger and paid $2 extra for sweet potato fries.  I got a cold cheeseburger that was worse than McDonalds and 22 small pieces of sweet potato fries.  No wonder there wasn't a wait on a Saturday night in Franklin.  I hope they can turn it around soon.
__label__2	The food at Szechuan Tasty House is good but their delivery service is terrible! After the 3rd time of delivery half an hour to an hour late, we will never order from them again. They shouldn't even offer delivery if they can't deliver.
__label__2	The food was okay, and average priced. I had the sausage trio and they were cooked well and tasty, but one of the three was overpowering. The sides are fairly good, I had the mac and cheese, and collard greens. The waitresses' attitude was friendly but not all of our food came out at the same time, and there was only the four of us in the restaurant. One person's food didn't come out until about 5 minutes after the rest.
__label__2	Most of the desserts are just okay, nothing incredible. But they used to have the most amazing delicious decorated sugar cookies. They almost always had them when I went frequently, and they would make extra with unique decorations for holidays and Tampa events (gasparilla, BBQ fest). We went to order them for our last office event and they were gone! When we called to request a special order, they said their main decorator who did those special treats is gone now and none of the other decorators can do it. That's prob why the treats are nothing outstanding to look at.
__label__2	I'm giving 2 stars because I feel I got a bit duped at the bar. We discussed with the bar tender which Rye would be best in my Sazerac and she suggested using Angel's Envy which we agreed to. The sazerac was outstanding and I was quite impressed. That is until I got the bill. That Sazerac was $32!  Seriously?  The bar tender apologized because she had not mentioned the PRICE INCREASE and we paid and tipped appropriately. I just wish I had known ahead of time there was a 5X markup for this particular premium Rye!
__label__2	"Acme is definitely a tourist trap. The food is decent, but the wait time is ridiculous (see tourist trap comment).  

There are so many other places in New Orleans to eat, there's really no sense in waiting so long! Advice: do not take a large group. You'll die of old age before you are seated. 

But if you must, definitely have the oysters."
__label__2	"long wait for the food,long wait for refills.
Dirty table with gum under. 
The server was no where to be found. 
The food was okay they put to much mayonnaise in the sushi to feel you up."
__label__2	Slides are fun.  Expect a bit of a wait on the more popular ones.  Lazy river is fun, but wish they would limit it to people on tubes only.  Having people swim and dive around you while you're trying to relax is a bit annoying.  Wave pool can get crowded and tubes can get scarce.  Bathrooms are so nasty.  Definitely wouldn't go in without flip flops.
__label__2	First time inside a McDonald's in many years.  Looks very nice.  Another fast food location with a touch screen  to order at.   Very easy to use, but if goal is for better and  faster service it fails.    Person at the walk up counter  ordered, got food , ate  and left before our food arrived.   Other down side  was sweet tea was empty and no large drink lids.  Typical food taste for a McDonald's.
__label__2	"ATMOSPHERE: 8.6
SERVICE: 7.7
FOOD: 3.7

Great date place. Food is good--- the first time I went. Until my 2nd attempt, when I ordered from the Asian side. Soup tasted like dish water. Then my friend had old salad, and then the manager would not give us the refund, and kept trying to reconcile and just had us order more food."
__label__2	The service was okay. The ambiance was nice. This restaurant came HIGHLY recommended; however, the food was very disappointing. The baked penne did not taste authentic at all. It lacked seasoning and sausage. My friend's meal was lacking in consistency with his house ravioli. The caprese salad lacked freshness and flavor. Lastly, the tiramisu was anticlimactic and unbalanced.
__label__2	Terrible service, watered down drinks (both alcohol and non alcoholic).    The food was average.    There appeared to be enough workers but a lot of standing around and hiding in the back.   The server lacked communication skills and was not friendly or accommodation at all .  The service was very slow.   There are many better options for Mexican food in the Indy area.
__label__2	Love tropical smoothie but this location is horrible. Waited 20 minutes for a flatbread and nobody else was in the store. 4 people working but one person was making smoothies and food by themselves.
__label__2	Service seems okay, wasn't happy with the flavor of the strawberry (quart) packed custard I purchased. Also I'm not a fan of corn syrup being used as an ingredient in the custard, prefer actual sugar. Just my take.
__label__2	Ordered a strawberry bubble tea & crispy chicken to-go, the drink was so disgusting I had to throw it away after a couple sips & the crispy chicken was not crispy. Darn! I had high hopes to find a good bubble tea location.
__label__2	Dined at this place with my husband and friends, I wasn't impressed at all, the food wasn't all I expected it to be, and the bathrooms were Nasty, dirty. I'd never go back and I wouldn't advise anyone to go there...,
__label__2	I thought Whitebox was mediocre at best and do not understand what all the hype is about.  This is basically a fast casual brunch spot in the middle of Carondelet.  Parking is atrocious given its location.  The food is average, and the adult beverages are subpar.  I am glad a tried but will not return.
__label__2	Food is good, wait staff are fine.  However do NOT visit without reservation as the front desk is inept.  No real assessment of time.  45 minutes actually means 1 hour and 30 mins.  Nor do they afford every customer with the same information.  (For example, one party is told they can wait 45 mins or go to the bar section which is free seating.  Another customer - us - isn't told anything but the wait time.)
__label__2	Over priced, and sub-par. The food was good but was really over priced. $10 for 4 crab rangoons... $4 for ONE spring roll, and $6 for a boba tea?? I wouldn't have minded if the food was delicious, but I know of way better places for a more reasonable price. Not to mention we were the only ones in the restaurant and it took us 40 min to get our food with five employees working. It made no sense.
__label__2	Average food , rude server , got the wrong bill with no apologies and did not ask one time how are we doing or refilled water... Although we are staying at the hilton but would go some where else dine
__label__2	"Too busy Too Noisy, Too Fast it's not at All like 25 years ago when my soon to be husband took me on an a lunch date.  We were married shortly there after, went there for quite a few lunches and Dinners, I even got together with ""The Lunch Bunch from TWA"". It was a bunch of commuter guys from all over the USA lookin for a decent place to get lunch.  
  My husband and I have been living in Dog Town USA for over 26 years now,  we stopped going to ""Schamous"" cuz the Croud and the workers have no respect."
__label__2	Great pianos... Weak drinks! If you're going to drink only order beer. I just watched the bartender pour me a whiskey and ginger ale with like a 2 second pour! Pitiful! ::edit and it was $9.00!::
__label__2	Well I know why there is no wait to get in this place. We went for brunch and I tried to get past the horrible service we had, but then the food came out cold. Such a huge disappointment. The employees only wanted to chat with each other.... no drink refills unless you begged.
__label__2	I would just call it flat bread, not pizza. It was okay. Nothing to rave about. Kind of pricey for portion and as a Wash U student I'd go there if I was desperate for a quick bite.
__label__2	"I was surprised b/c of the glowing reviews, but what I ordered online and what was delivered were two totally different bouquets.  I did call and they offered no refund (even partial), just to ""redo"" it and have it delivered again.  Maybe two would've added up to what I ordered, but I was just over it.  See pics."
__label__2	Went to Bohemian Rhapsody tonight and saw the film in theater 16.  Loved the film. The quality of the sound and picture quality was at best an Analog picture and sound quality was very disappointing.  For a music film production this is not the spot for those that appreciate better quality! They need to upgrade this theatre.
__label__2	"Place is a dive...but there wasnt any casino near my hotel...this was across the street from the hotel i was stayin at.
I lost over 500$ from Blackjack and Roulette...
not gonna lie i was playin reckless!!!
after losin $$ i went to buy a hot dog at the Lucky Dogs stand inside the casino...made my night @4am lol =)"
__label__2	My honey and i decided on mexican for lunch, encanto was a huge mistake, the food was extremely bland and wholly unappetizing.  The restaurant was small and not as clean as it should be (the bathroom was horrifying).  They got 2 stars because the staff was very sweet.
__label__2	The store itself is OK, with friendly staff and a nice selection of products. Just don't buy gas here unless it's a dire emergency. It's not just a few cents more here, it's ridiculously over priced. If memory serves, they are about 30-40 cents higher than the gas station at Magazine and Washington.
__label__2	"Cash only ""Because of the rain, our system is down."" 

Wow. So rain isn't something you can prepare for in a city with a climate that is downright tropical. 

Got it. 

After passing up several other options to come here when I have a sick kid. 

No Bueno. 

Nothing the employees can do except apologize for an inept corporate conundrum. 

LAWD. Some days, Nola."
__label__2	Something about there pizza that i've never really been a fan of. the insides nicely done.
__label__2	Food is quite good. The most major annoyance about this place is that parking is well nigh impossible to find. We have come several times to circle around the parking lot unable to find parking, thus we went elsewhere each time. Poor planning at its finest.
__label__2	two co-workers brought back pretzels today and I was going to try one. However, when I went out to the truck (at 1:30pm) today in front of my office, the gal behind the glass just waved and voiced they were closed. Oh ok, it's 1:30 which I don't find terribly late for lunch, but it might've been nice to have her actually tell me this rather than wave her arms at me talking behind the window. Not sure I will ever try them after that.
__label__2	"Just gonna keep it short. Worst $23 prime rib I've ever had. Super slow service and food delivery. Not even busy in there. 
My buddy also ordered prime rib. He wanted it rare. Came out near well done. They made him a second one and it was not even close to rare. 
When you pay over $20 bucks for a steak, it should be right. Overall not impressed with this place. I'd skip it if I were you."
__label__2	Decided to try Tiffin after reading some reviews.  Tried the eggplant chaat appetizer because someone had raved about it.  It was horrible.  Mostly chopped raw onions.  On the other hand the vegetable korma was delicious.
__label__2	"I stopped here with my coworker, while traveling on business. It was a quick easy lunch.
This place has a fun 50's vibe, with red and white decor and music to match. Also, an interesting train track suspended from the ceiling. 
The food was ok...I ordered a salad with grilled chicken (came fried), my counterpart ordered a burger and fries. Salad was average, nothing special...my coworker said that she liked the burger, but only ate half of it. 
I would likely choose another place next time."
__label__2	Place looks nice. I was with a party of 6. The order took a while to give. It took over an hour to get food. Unfortunately 4 other parties came and left before the food came out. Not sure that I will return. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!
__label__2	Very disappointed. My boyfriend and I came in for Pedis this morning and this is what we left with. Rushed service and hardly any change. Pretty disappointed because we were referred here by friends since we are new to the area and this is what we ended up with. I would have had better luck doing my own pedicure at home. His feet are still rough and cracked and so are mine.. see pics. Also keep in mind we got our pedicures done at 11 am and it is 2 pm now..
__label__2	Worst meal I ever had in NOLA. Booked it for NYE, insufficient staff, poor quality food and not worth the money we had to pay. Then they brought in a  loud DJ before we had even finished our meal that played obnoxious music. Left before midnight just to escape the noise.
__label__2	"Stayed in the ""new"" building. Clean room but small, and in old building. No movies on tv. Cable wasn't working. The hallway was 100 degrees and muggy. Overall, pretty disappointed. Parking lot is tiny and nearly impossible for an SUV to park."
__label__2	"First off the gal at the register on January 25th at 1130 was very friendly and helpful. She was so busy and didn't freak out or get frustrated. She was great. Having said that the wings were greasy and the fries were soggy. The blue cheese dressing is usually very chunky but not this time

I have tried to order from this location twice in the last month. I'm on hold for sooo long that I give up."
__label__2	This might be one of the worst representations of golds gym I've ever seen no space between machines horrible atmosphere lack of variety with equipment and machines all in all it just doesn't feel like a real golds gym you'd be better off saving your $30 a month and going to another gym
__label__2	The items here seemed to be hit or miss. The fried alligator and cheeks were absolutely delicious, but the Cochon was pretty horrible.  It was bland. I would absolutely avoid that item which seems ridiculous as their name would suggest it should be a speciality.  It was so bad that we added on two extra items after tasting it because we knew we couldnt stomach it ( the mac and cheese and shrimp).    This place would be a 4 or 5 star restaurant, but was really turned off by the Cochon.
__label__2	They say they take walk-ins but when you walk-in right when they open they can't tattoo you and want you to come back in the evening. Most people when they come to Reno they want to get a tattoo right then and there, not having to come back.
__label__2	"Good: Live music, good bands, some drink specials, location.

Bad: Owner and staff is not customer service oriented, actually the customer service is really bad. Short tempered staff. Bartenders can conveniently forget the specials and overcharge, then give you the stink eye for calling them on it. It also takes a long time to get a drink.

Been there 5 times, 1 out of 5 was a blast and that is because my friend suffered getting the drinks."
__label__2	"Corn and crab soup was disappointing, perhaps added crab would have helped the flavor.
Wait staff left something to be desired, especially the gal who brought food to the table. The spoon for my wife's corn and crab soup was in the soup.  This was not noted and we fished for the spoon and wiped with my only paper napkin."
__label__2	Wife and I went here because we were just to exhausted to find somewhere more suitable. BIG mistake we ordered the 2 for $5. We both got the fish. Each fish sandwich had 1/4 of a slice of cheese and each little piece of cheese was stick more to the box than to the fish. The fries were extremely cold. But the server was nice if that helps.
__label__2	"Had delivery. Fried dumplings ok. Beef Lo Mein smelled and tasted like cigarettes, not kidding. Threw out. Gave hot ""Cold Sesame Noodle"" and Chicken Lo Mein to neighbor. Drank the cokes. Unfortunate."
__label__2	Well I drove all this way for brunch for 2.  That being the bloody Mary with the Cornish hens and they don't have any.  The waitress says they only make 4 a day.  So you have brunch from 10-2 and you only make 4 for the day.   Very POOR
__label__2	I had flowers delivered for Mother's Day, and asked for Lilacs to be included.  Unfortunately, the lilacs were withered within one day.  While the arrangement is beautiful with different flowers not just lilacs, my mom loves lilacs so that was the focal point which I requested.   I have never had flowers die within a day of delivery.  I should have been told that the lilacs were not fresh, and they would not last, and then I would have chosen a different flower.
__label__2	I came here on Tuesday 12/12/17. I ordered a turkey wrap and my aunt got a Deluxe sandwich. The tortilla shell that held my wrap together was dry and literally tasted like rubber, again. This is my second time ordering the turkey wrap and their tortillas have a nasty, rubbery, bitter initial taste and aftertaste. I just can't hide it with honey mustard anymore. Figured I say something. They forgot the lettuce and tomato on my aunt's deluxe sandwich. Only thing that keeps me coming are the waffle fries.
__label__2	I had Amorino many times in France and definitely it was a disappointment here at this store.  Amorino is known for making their ice cream like flower pedals and for sure my classic scoops were not.  Service was slow and employees looked confused.  That being said the ice cream is good so 2 stars lol
__label__2	I usually love coming here, but recently prices have gone up without them acknowledging it. My nails have paint all over them and are not cleaned up or shaped correctly. The girl doing my nails seemed to be in a hurry to get me out of there, so it's sloppy work.
__label__2	"What are the 2 stars for? The location...that's it.

Whenever I'm in Phila or NYC, I book for the Express Bus. Whenever the staff feel like following their own rules about calling for boarding numbers, lining up customers and getting the buses away on time, then it works fine - shame, those are becoming rare occasions."
__label__2	Not good in my opinion...burgers are subpar and the milkshakes suck. They don't even use real ice cream in the milkshakes. Every time I've had a milkshake it's riddled with ice crystals.
__label__2	Grab a drink before dinner or after dinner type of place... it was way busier than the bartender could handle that night when we were there...Whiskey choice, great ! Atmosphere, just so so.We were probably there for only 15 minutes ??? I will take my hard-earned dollar elsewhere.
__label__2	"They did an alright job washing my car. Not great. I pulled up in the driveway and I was the first in line and it took about 10 minutes for someone to greet me. 

They didn't accept the yelp coupon that I received for checking in. 

The consol was still dirty after they were finished. 

It was $20 so it was pretty inexpensive, but I would probably try some place else before going here again."
__label__2	Their window sign/graphics says same day service available.  However, they do not actually do same day service (an employee clarified to this me.)
__label__2	Don't go here for the scallops, mashed potatoes, or the rice. The mashed potatoes taste like cat litter and the rest taste like it's been sitting out for hours. The staff is nice but the food isn't worth it.
__label__2	We chose this restaurant because it was right across the street from our hotel. I wrongly assumed it was the same Abuelas as the ones in Wichita and OKC. At first we couldn't find the entrance, but once inside we found a lovely, contemporary space. This is definitely not your usual Mexican restaurant. There was a limited menu with a lot of dishes I've never heard of.  I ordered the cochinita pibil. Don't. The food and service were disappointing. We left through a side door and ended up ina dark courtyard with no exit.
__label__2	They had good cheesesteak, but not worth the amount, I'd rather get something more authentic at a foodtruck lol It was my birthday and they made us pay for the celebratory cupcake...
__label__2	Came here on a Friday night around 6 and experienced painfully slow service. They were not packed at all but drinks, food, etc took so long. Not sure why... there was a ton of staff working. The food was above average (pork = very tasty) but the slow service really hurt our overall experience. Hopefully some better training for the servers (barrio blonde is NOT an IPA), a couple of bus boys, and a manager that is checking in with guests rather than running food is implemented soon...
__label__2	Got my eyebrows waxed here and they turned out horribly. Completely lopsided and mismatched. At the price they charge I'm honestly shocked.  I was very clear with the lady that I just wanted a easy clean up, now it will take months to fix her over eager waxing. I did go in and speak with someone about this, they admitted the issue and provided me with a refund. Good business practice. There is nothing to be done now, just need to grow them out and look odd.
__label__2	I'm thinking these pierogis must be much better not as takeout because they did not travel well at all. They were beyond greasy, practically dripping. The cheddar jalapeño were really good flavor wise. Potato pancakes were okay but so so so greasy. I absolutely do not recommend the crab Rangoon ones (seemed risky to begin with but anyway) they were not crab but the chopped up fake crab stick with the overwhelming fishy flavor - good idea, horrible execution.
__label__2	$16 for chips, salsa and queso. AYFKM ?  What a rip off. Stay away from here. Prices are ridiculous. Food is bar food not even better. I live in the area and have for over 30 years. Now I know why I don't eat here.
__label__2	Maybe it was an off day.  Though I had been here a couple times before and had a similar impression.  This time the chicken.  Basically it seemed lightly cooked but unflavored raw vegetables, raw udon noodles, tough unflavored chicken, all placed in a bowl of broth with slight flavor but thin as water.  That's pretty much it for about $11.  I applaud a local indie effort but it reminded me of what happens when someone like me who has no idea how to cook, tries to cook.  Wish them luck, and maybe some inspiration.
__label__2	Josh's  use to be the best pizza around, at least we thought so. The last two times we ordered the crust was both on the burnt side we were not happy.
__label__2	Aug 6, 2015 Had dinner at Hook's tonight in 84% temp.  We complained and were told the waitress is sweating too.  No Manager ever came over to offer apologies or even a discount for it being so uncomfortable.  If this is how they are going to treat customers they aren't going to have repeat customers.  Experience and food is everything!
__label__2	I've been to Zama multiple times (mostly for lunch) and always thought the food was good. Then I went to dinner with a couple of my girlfriends two weeks ago and two of us got sick from the sushi. The only reason we know it's the sushi is because the 3rd person didn't eat it. Zama used to be on my go-to list for sushi in Philly but if I go again, I will only be ordering hot dishes.
__label__2	The food was very good and the staff is nice, but it felt like that I was eating at horse stable with all the flies.
__label__2	"UPDATE:  Buffet quality has gone down significantly.  Undercooked chicken.  Very sorry to say as this place had so much potential.

ORIGINAL REVIEW
Finally!  A great Indian restaurant in Reno!  I have been to the buffet twice and the quality and selection were great.  This place is what Reno needed."
__label__2	Stopped in for lunch on a Saturday.  Incredibly poor service. Granted, we were a group of 8 but the food that did come was delayed and the waitress didn't put in 2 full orders!!  Food was decent but this review is totally based on service.
__label__2	We ordered rolls and hibachi , steak and scallops. Everything came out all at once, and we waited a long time for the food to come out. The hibachi had very little steak and scallops, it was basically a  plate of veggies with a side of white rice and the steak was only cooked one way. The rolls were good, we had the Gary roll, veggie roll and avocado roll.
__label__2	I like the 7 alarm pizza. It's amazing. I don't care much about their regular pizzas. I'm less than 3 miles away and no delivery so only gets 2 stars for that.
__label__2	Nice view of Vinoy basin however so crowded and touristy makes it not worth it. Go try Paul's Landing at Vinoy.
__label__2	"Tacos: literally salty and shaped like tacobell. Not even joking.

Drinks are OK but overpriced.

I shouldn't spend $80 on Mexican food. Ever. 

(Disclaimer: I'm a Mexican from the south, so I know my shit.)"
__label__2	Greek food is well known for using FRESH, seasonal ingredients that pop on the plate.  Everything we ordered here tasted like it came out of a can or a freezer bag.  Menu items that should have been straightforward  (greek salad, grilled calamari) were disappointing and poorly executed. We ordered appetizers, soups and main course and we were still in and out in less than 45 minutes.  Not an enjoyable dining experience on any level.
__label__2	Overpriced for what you actually get. Service took forever too. But the blood orange margarita is great
__label__2	We ate dinner with the fire alarm going off. Overpriced! But I'm a good cook, so the food was good.
__label__2	This place used to have the best car washes. Now, it's very hit or miss. I got my truck washed there a few weeks ago. The outside looked good, but the inside was not great. I got my other car washed there yesterday, and they did a much better job. For $30, I expect a great job every time.
__label__2	The only reason I can think of coming here is if you want to sit down and eat.  If you are looking to get a dozen bagels to take out, Brandon Bagel a few blocks west of Einstein is a much better choice.  Einstein does have a $6 baker's dozen special on Mondays, but I will still spend the extra $4 and go to Brandon Bagel since the quality is so much better.  A final note, if you want your bagels sliced, don't let them use their slicing machine that does a really poor job.
__label__2	Wasn't too happy when I saw the guy handling the cash at the register go straight to the grill and started handling raw chicken without washing his hands or using gloves
__label__2	Disappointing to say the least.  Went for appetizer and drinks. Service was excellent. It is more inviting inside now. Here's the bad: we ordered chicken fingers and they were pounded so thin you couldn't taste the chicken.  The crust was hard enough to hurt your teeth and mostly just tasted like garlic.  The sauces were the best part, but not anything you can't get at a good chain.  The new chef needs to taste what he/she is sending out.  Will try again because we support the neighborhood but boy, were we shocked at how bad the food we got was.
__label__2	My two usual favorites (gumbo and potato salad) were over salted today. Never had this problem before. My husband had a fish and shrimp plate. The shrimp were over cooked, but the fish was good. We've been here quite a few times over the last 6 years. This was disappointing.
__label__2	Two hour wait after order was taken. No attempt by owner to address the issue. Inexperienced waitstaff, nice but clueless.
__label__2	"We've been going to the Spruce Goose for decades. Recently it's become impossible to get a cart for hauling your tree, and the trees are quite picked over (perhaps a victim of their own success). AND they recently changed their dog policy so you can't bring your dog on the lot. 

What used to be a relaxing day with the family is now just a giant hassle, with the furry family members abandoned in the car. We'll be going to a different place from now on on."
__label__2	"So, the arch is super cool. The ride up is super-meh. Definitely go, walk underneath it. Walking under it inspired a great sense of awe. The view from the top though? Not worth the $10 or whatever it was.

The area is currently under construction, so you need to walk down to Walnut to access the Arch."
__label__2	"Nice food, but it wasn't stated that everything came with rice, so rather than call me, they sent 3 lots of rice (2 entrees and the rice I ordered, thinking it wasn't included). Better customer service would've been to call me and tell me this, offering substitutes. 
Delivery also took a while."
__label__2	Chumleys is still alive and well at this 'new' restaurant in BR. Service is the same; terrible. You'll sit and wait for 10-15 minutes before anyone even approaches you. Beers are the same; broad selection but nothing you can't find elsewhere with better ambiance and food. Food is actually worse, in my opinion. I'm willing to bet this place will regenerate into something else soon enough.
__label__2	The atmosphere is warm and cozy.  The service was attentive.  What needs work is the presentation.  I ordered the black snapper.  It came out as a piece of fish with an ice cream scoop of mashed potatoes.  No garnish. Not even a dusting of parsley.  For $26.00 it was absolutely unappealing. Others at the table ordered a steak.  Came out the same way.  A piece of meat, a scoop of potatoes sitting all alone on a big round white plate.  THESE PLATES NEED GARNISH!!!!  I felt like I was at a diner.
__label__2	I love this store as it's next to my house but have to say please please butcher department the meat you sell is awful we bought many T bone steaks for Labor Day cook out and we could not even cut them with our knifes so much fat and grizzle this is happening more and more and I would rather pay more cash and go elsewhere I would like to know if others have had this issue
__label__2	Not that good for the price. Good location but parking is terrible. I have had better seafood back home in Texas. Clam chowder was just ok. Coconut shrimp just ok. Crab cakes terrible too much stuffing. Would not recommend much better choices in the area.
__label__2	Not fogo.  But also, not good.  Meat was bland, not tasty.  Very few cuts of steak.  Salad bar had some chicken dish that I think was just butter,  ketchup, and chicken mixed together.  The margarita was ok.
__label__2	Very sad to say that I have to join several others here in saying this once favorite restaurant seems to be slipping. My yellow curry with chicken was thin and flavorless. The chicken in this dish tonight was very substandard. It reminded me of the thin frozen chicken some stir fry restaurant use. We added an order of Crying Tiger because I truly could not eat the bland curry. Again, disappointment. This typically amazing fish was undercooked and flavorless. I hope they get things turned around soon.
__label__2	"I sat at the bar.  
The pizza was excellent but the bartender/server was horrible.  

He was chatting up some friends and then chatting up his coworkers and totally abandoned the customers at the bar.  

It took forever to place my order. 

My glass was empty almost the entire time I was there. 

And I grew old waiting for the bill so that I could leave."
__label__2	Typically I enjoyed this place until they stated me more for what I was drinking. 8 tequila shots for 3 people? No. And the. I'm shamed for stuff I didn't drink lol
__label__2	I have eaten here many of times, the food is good but the wait staff is rude and very slow
__label__2	My BF surprised me with some Pat's after a long night at school.  It was rather dry and there was not a lot of steak on the roll.  The Wiz was good, but I feel like I could make a better steak made out of Steakums on an Amoroso.  If you want a hardy, excellent steak, drive to South Jersey and try Seagraves!
__label__2	Beware the is prepared in a very unsanitary setting. teapot and serving utinsels are unclean. There are better choices. Review Philadelphia Health Department inspections before choosing these venues
__label__2	Nice rooms. Clean. But the place is very old. Tiny bayhroom. Oh, people can stand outside the room and clearly see into the bathroom area. No way to fix this.
__label__2	Have been here about 10 times over the past 6 months for eyebrow waxing, gel manicures and pedicures. Have never been offered a drink. Recently went with my mother-in-law for a girls night. We opted for regular manicures. When we asked for a glass of wine, we were told it was only for people getting a gel manicure and up. (Note: sign says 1 complimentary glass of wine per visit). They either need to change their sign or comply! We were embarassed and will not be returning.
__label__2	Food was good, but i had to wait over 30 minutes just to receive my bill as my waitress was hiding in a little corner playing on her phone. It was quite interesting that she checked on every table but mines. Highly upset that gratuity was included because she didnt deserve not one cent. The experience counts for half of the visit so all in all I would rather just go to the seafood restaurant 5 minutes away.
__label__2	Usually every one is very nice at this location. Today the pharmacy tech lady with super short hair was short with me.... I came to pick up my kids meds and they weren't ready so I was looking around the candy and stuff in the front of the register since I was the only one there I wasn't in the way. She snapped at me and told me to go sit down around the corner...Wtf? Don't treat me like a child, I have plenty of other shit on my mind so if I wanna look at candy, let me!
__label__2	Interesting concept that ends up feeling gimmicky.  Overpriced for something that doesn't really taste like ice cream or yogurt.  $3.75 for a kid's size! What a bummer.  I was hoping to enjoy this!  Spend your $ at Huddle's instead.
__label__2	Bought my car here and got it serviced. Couldn't get a part I needed that day which is weird because it's one of their more popular cars. General feeling of getting ripped off somehow.
__label__2	Don't go!! Drinks are watered down! Girls are mediocre. Most look under the age of 21.  20$ to get in? For what??!!! Don't go!! Take my advice!! Check out the strip in Brooklyn Illinois, you'll get a lot more for your money, alcoholic drinks, panty less freaks, private dances for half price, better music, smoking. Don't go! Try pink slip for a real experience of pleasure.
__label__2	"meh. the food is never very good, the chicken seems to be low quality and nothing is special or very flavorful. I always think about the Zagat review that said, ""more like mediocre grill."" TRUTH.

I know the happy hour and margaritas are good, but shouldn't the food be too for a place this popular and since it is primarily a restaurant?"
__label__2	"I won't say this place is bad but should be called a $$$ establishment.
See when one get charge so much for something one expect nothing but the best and that's where this bakery failed all my expectation.
Staff is friendly but the portions and food and general I cannot give them more than a two stars.
Basically you're paying for the name no the food."
__label__2	What's the point in a reservation? Had to wait 30 minutes to sit down even with reservation! This is absurd and  outrageous. Food was alright but I would not go back.
__label__2	My saleswoman, Margret, was pretty good. She was personable and even grabbed me and my kids a bad a chips and water when I mentioned we were getting hungry. However, the General manager was very dismissive to her and ultimately me when she asked him to help her order my furniture. I spent more than 2 hours trying to help her get all my items entered in correctly. Next time I'll just make my furniture purchases online if not a different store all together.
__label__2	This place has fallen off so bad  the steak i had the meat was not real meat taste like kangaroo meat .it was horrible and I use to love this place but am going pay $7.50 for a steak made with fake meat. When I bit into the sandwich it not real meat. I will not be back don't go here you will be disappointed.
__label__2	"This being my first time in NOLA, I had to try the muffuletta. We got the whole sandwich, it's too much bread and where's the meat? Also, the olive spread is too salty.  The only good thing I can say is it's filling for the 4 of us.  Lots of carbo.

I've had better sandwiches in San Francisco and New York.  I will skip this sandwich the next time I'm in NOLA.

If you really have to try this sandwich, don't except too much, then you won't be too disappointed."
__label__2	Please avoid going to this restaurant! I only had to wait 10 to 15 minutes to get a table, which is good. But once inside, the place was a mess! The floor was slippery and full of trash. Both the seats and the walls were greasy. They don't offer a regular hand menu but a QR code to scan and see the options online. We couldn't get to the website so finally the server brought us printed menus. The food arrived hours later. Very slow table service! Overall, awful experience!!!!
__label__2	If I were basing this review on the food alone, it would get another star but the service has been suffering over the last several months and last night was enough to make me never want to return, addicted as I am to the pork mexican rolls and mexican pizza. I am pretty forgiving if the place is crowded (last night, it was not) but how do you--as one of four bartender/servers-- let customers sit at the bar for over an hour with empty glasses and not follow up?
__label__2	"Eh. That's how I felt about the food. Not delicious, but not terrible. The portions are huge, so you get what you pay for. The rice and salad were tasty but my chicken and potatoes shared the same seasoning and they were both over seasoned. The pita bread came out of a plastic bag so you had some grocery store pita on your plate. Eh.

Still in the hunt for some good Greek!"
__label__2	This used to be a great restaurant. Last few orders were truly awful.  Gen Tao was hard and dry, and I threw it out.  Spare ribs that were so burnt they were inedible, then there was last night...  what looked like gorgeous butterfly shrimp but in a sweet and sour orange sauce???  It was $14 of disgusting. Even the noodles for the soup are awful now.  New owners? New cooks?  Just had great food from Liu Gardens- it's worth the trip.
__label__2	Average food & on the pricy side for what you get. Started with a flatbread which was overly salted, then a bland bison burger. Menu is limited, wouldn't recommend.
__label__2	this place used to be incredible. Great deals near it's over price used junk you have to scour the store just to find item you would be interested in paying for artwork that is  overpriced.... very long a check out to cash register at this location on Hillsborough. Not a good shopping experience
__label__2	"Most mediocre expensive meal I have ever had.  My wine glass was not filled enough for $10.. The food was not up to par in my opinion.  Do better Dinardos.  This is why no one comes here.  

Staff is great."
__label__2	There were bits of crab shell in my meal that made it very unappetizing. Service was so so.
__label__2	"Waited a long time to visit Pennhurst and was sadly disappointed.  For ""fear"" of wasting too much money on all 4 attractions, opted only for the Asylum and Dungeon which was the biggest mistake.  Apparently the Tunnel was where the only scare was...
Though the facility itself is super creepy and the actors good, neither attraction was scary at all.  If you like being poked, prodded and having your head patted and hair fondled a lot, then this place is for you.  Otherwise, not worth it."
__label__2	"Historic location. Crappy replacement for neighborhood bar. Not great for locals. Seems to cater to the frat type bro. Take down the dumb multi colored draft list made from kids magnets. No one can read it. Get some
Decent wine and better beer. Get it together. Could be great. Someone told me you charge $3 for ice. Are you kidding? Did I say the music sucks and there are 4 giant goddamn tvs lined up next to one another?"
__label__2	We like to joke at our house that this is the worst Papa Murphys in town and time and again they prove us right. We ordered 2 pizzas, that were supposed to be thin crust, apparently they did not get this memo. I don't know what they do at this location but the pizza never tastes as good as other Papa Murphys. The vegetarian pizza just had no flavor. The garlic chicken pizza was decent. The good news is that we had coupons so we saved some pennies.
__label__2	"The food is great for a pizza place.  I would give them 4 stars but the feature item on their menu ""porchetta"" is never available.  It is featured  dead center on the menu but they never have it.  I have ordered it ten times in a row but no luck.  I asked the owner about it and he said they make it regularly but it sells out fast.  Please don't lie to me!!  I could tell he was lying.  I have ordered it soon after they open and still no luck.  Take it off the menu if you can't bother!"
__label__2	Ordered 2 large pizzas and fries for pickup within 20-25 minutes. Arrived roughly 30 minutes after placing ordered and drove 10 minutes home. They both taste like 2-3 day old pizza. Who knew that was actually a thing? This reminded me why I drive to the Houghton location where everything is fresh and hot even after the drive home.
__label__2	Very much displeased with the idea of now having to reserve seats. This theater doesn't even have the recliners. I hope it'll be changed back, it's a very frustrating addition.
__label__2	Update: since my terrible experience, the stylist who did my hair promptly contacted me, apologized, and refunded my money. I added back a star for good customer service, at least after the fact. I gave it some thought, though, and I still just don't feel comfortable going back there.
__label__2	This placed used to be Sushi on the Rocks. They offered somewhat the same menu. However, they don't have the same promo and points perk membership.The owners are nice and accommodating. The food and experience can be better. It seriously went downhill. This place is in need of Gordon Ramsay's touch.
__label__2	There better be pearls in those oysters. How do you get away with charging $21.a doz. for oysters where the competition like Rock Salt Tavern, Thirsty Marlin , Molly Goodheads, etc. charges $13-$15 for a doz. delicious fresh plump oysters.
__label__2	Rides were fun...but they planned poorly...they have every restaurant shut down...and none of the employees know this.  They keep telling us such and such is still open...we rush over and they're closed.  It's almost like a big joke being played on the park's guests
__label__2	"Ok, ive drank milk from everywhere, every company, and every dairy. The only milk that doesnt ""taste weird"" to me is the pink lable skim milk they sell. Dont ask me why.  This is the main reason i go there. The rest of my experience there makes me feel ill."
__label__2	The service was horrible.  Took them over 20 minutes to make my drink.  Salad and bread sticks didn't come out together.  We had to ask several waiters and the manager for my drink.  Waiter had to ask several times what we ordered.  Had a little chat with the manager.  Luckily they credited our meals.  Still left a tip for the waiter.  I told my wife I don't blame the waiter, I blame the company and it's staff for not training him properly.
__label__2	Food is bland and too much msg! Overhyped and too modernized it doesn't taste authentic enough for it to even pass as a mediocre Vietnamese restaurant
__label__2	Not much for selection, the prices were high and the staff wasn't interactive except for our checker.
__label__2	"Food is good for the most part. Sometimes it's greasy and they don't always pay attention to special notes.
Calling in an order is a NIGHTMARE. Which is a huge down side when you're in a hurry.
One or two guys are unbelievably rude-and go as far as hanging up you when you try to order.
Could be an amazing place if they could get their act together."
__label__2	Cool atmosphere and great service, but terrible food. Dry steak tacos. Stale chips, flavorless tostones dish. Maybe go there for drinks, but definitely not food.
__label__2	"We went there for lunch because we heard it was famous and supposed to have great poboys. The food here totally don't worth the price!!! The waitress is really rude too. She brought our food and told us ""you can leave tip on the table"". What is that!?!? 

Never gonna come back again!"
__label__2	Gone here twice and just didn't think they go the extra step in perfection when it comes to a good manicure or pedicure both times I left feeling unhappy that the Polish had lumps or didn't fully coat nail or cuticles weren't as neat.
__label__2	Waaay over priced for the burgers they make.I mean if your gonna charge 10 bucks for a burger I'd better be amazing this one didn't even come close to that. The ends of the patty were burnt which made the burger taste bitter. Way too salty and it resembles one that you would buy at schnucks. Small bun, small patty. For 10 dollars I can get a whole meal somewhere not a itty bitty salty burger like here
__label__2	I have lived here 5 years..some good some bad..great location...just know they will do everything to steal your security deposit.  2 stars for being theives
__label__2	"Staff was friendly. But we tried to order an egg and cheese sandwich, which is on the menu, and were told that we couldn't get it because the cook ""didn't want to make it"". We ended up getting our sandwiches, but they were just microwaved eggs and they didn't have salt or pepper anywhere in the store."
__label__2	This location is incredibly dirty tonight.  Almost every table has food on it.  The dishes are piled a mile high at the trash cans.  It's as if no one works here, or they just don't care.
__label__2	Food good but AC not working inside
__label__2	Don't hightly recommend. Price was good at first when we book but because we picked up the car later then we reserved for they charged us a penalty. At no time during the pick up process did they mention that within the week they would be moving so when we returned to check the car in, the building was empty! Luckily we had planned extra time for the car return process.
__label__2	Really disappointed.  I got a dip powder manicure and the tech cut my cuticles with the drill two times, the shapes of my nails were completely different nail to nail -  I needed to completely reshape them when I got home. The surface of the dip is rough and bumpy, not totally smooth.  The station was dirty and covered in dust, and I felt rushed to pick a color.  The tech was not gentle at all and didn't seem concerned when she cut my cuticles (which bled!). Not a good experience, I will not be coming back.
__label__2	I'm sure I just got the wrong thing (roast beef and gravy po' boy) but I wasn't a huge fan of this. Probably if you already love po' boys this will be great for you. If you've never had a po' boy, this is apparently the best place in town to get one, but I personally wasn't converted.
__label__2	"We ate outside, served by an ebullient server in one of those t-shirts that pretends to be a tux front. His enthusiasm didn't quite match his serving ability--he forgot our simple orders, time between courses pushed 30 minutes--but then he was so cheerful that it was mostly OK.

Below average pho is a head-shaking shame. The plate of fixins was there, but the third and fourth stars from this review are as absent as most of the crucial, long-cooked ingredients that make pho taste like itself."
__label__2	"This is not Texas Style BBQ

The brisket was really fatty.  I ordered the two meat platter with the brisket and the pulled pork.  The sides were really the best part.  The meat was barely warm when I received my meal and it only took about five minutes to get my meal.  Texas Style must be describing the ambiance because Texas style BBQ would not come out with sauce already on the meat.  I've had better in Maryland and that's alot further away from Texas."
__label__2	I was really excited to find this place because good coffee is hard to find in Arizona. There were only two people in line in front of me yesterday but the cashier was disorganized and slow. After 10 min of waiting for her to get the order of the people in front of me correct, I walked out. She was still trying to figure their order out when I left.
__label__2	Ugh, make sure you check your to go order before you leave. I paid for 7 tacos and got 6. Not worth it to drive back downtown for a single taco.
__label__2	I don't know if they are always like this, but this milkshake is pretty much all milk.  And it was expensive.  Cute place though with creative flavors.  Seems like a good spot if you have kids.
__label__2	I usually love this place. Service is always 5 starts!!! My server had black and purple hair ah was absolutely lovely and on top of things before we even asked for anything. Though 40 minutes before closed we were informed that the kitchen was closed (right after my food was dropped off) and wasn't able to order food to go like I had hoped. I have never had that experience before.
__label__2	"I placed an order with Uber Eats 3 hours before they close, and somehow it still tasted like I got leftover food. The fries were great even though the portion size isn't but the ""fried"" eggplant wrap was completely soggy and didn't have much flavor to it. The wrap itself was tough to bite. We have ordered from you guys in the past and the first time was amazing but it just seemed like this time was definitely lacking in quality."
__label__2	"If any bar takes its name literally, it's this one. Immediately upon entering, you're greeted with a wall of smoke so thick that you feel like you're visiting your great aunt's house in coal country. The bathroom smells like Philadelphia's biggest landfill. No really, there's a serious disregard for the courtesy flush rule...every time I go in there, I'm met with someone's last meal.

I want to like it, because I know you all do, but I. just. can't."
__label__2	"Was good previously but lately not so good. Last week- ordered and paid for brisket with other items take out. I get home no brisket but pulled pork. Burnt brusell sprouts. 
This week I ordered a 20 oz porterhouse cooked for takeout. I realize take out of a steak is dicey but I literally live half a mile away. Way over cooked and like leather. For 35 bucks I expected better. It's not like I was late because I had to wait for the order. Need to learn to cook steaks. The sides lately are way overcooked."
__label__2	This place looks very inviting from the outside, but I found it to be the most uncomfortable restaurant around this area,  the food is underwhelming...it is cooked properly but absolutely NO flavor and as we all are aware the staff shortage is a issue everywhere the staff here need a personality.....To each is own though feel free to give it a shot....plenty of better places around.....
__label__2	We have tried the pizza twice.  Good price for a plain cheese pie (under $13) but both times we found the pizza to taste although an old pie was merely heated up.  We may try once again, but not until we try the other pizza places opening up on Girard Ave.
__label__2	I have always loved this place. I always thought they have had great food and I have been coming here since I was young. I always order the hot braised chicken which is usually so good! Unfortunately, they changed owners and they changed the recipe to their chicken.. It is SO spicy and is not good at all anymore. I am very disappointed and will not be coming here anymore.
__label__2	If you're a fan of fine pour over or Chemex coffee's this isn't really the place. The staff is super friendly and they have a nice amount of outdoor seating. However their coffee and brew options are limited.
__label__2	"Food was cold when it first came out, and when it next came out, and was just barely warm on the 3rd try. I am not talking about just 1 of the 4 plates served....I am talking about all 4 plates. To the establishment's credit we were refunded a generous portion of our bill.
The server was polite and we appreciated her sincerity. 

Our prior visits here were enjoyable. However there are too many other establishments close by to consider coming back here and risking another disappointing experience."
__label__2	So disappointed. I got the Linguini Nero and it tasted like oily noodles. It was supposed to have crabmeat, but I couldn't tell by flavor. By sight, it was sparsely there. My boyfriend's pasta dish was equally disappointing. We started with the special, Oyster Tacos, which consisted of two tacos, inside which were shriveled portions of fried oyster. More lettuce could have possibly saved them.
__label__2	Used to have nice staff, but not anymore.  One employee especially makes you not want to return.
__label__2	average - but its probably the best place in fairmount for this type of food.  Fairmount has the worst places to eat in the city.
__label__2	Unresponsive. Had to call numerous times just to get a quote. Never got a response to follow-up questions. They were friendly, but clearly not interested in helping.
__label__2	I felt they were disengenous. Restaurant prices lower for wine but they charge you bar prices which are higher when you get the bill. They skimp in places where they shouldn't. Never going back
__label__2	This is an old school restaurant in a very touristy area. We normally wouldn't eat in such a touristy area, since prices tend to be high with little quality, but saw all the good reviews and figured we would give it a try. The food lacked any flavor whatsoever and our server seemed bored waiting on us. The biggest problem was our French bread was inedible and could have knocked someone out cold because it was so hard.
__label__2	ive been coming on and off to this farmers market since 2013 i used like it i used to buy there fresh seafood. all the time so good i notice there meat section smelled  really bad and there seafood prepackage did look healthy either its getting dirty looking as well. i dont think i being going here anymore there cleaner places like giant and wegman more expensive more healthy looking. lol but now worries of getting food poising.
__label__2	"When we first walked passed I though another overpriced tourist trap place. Saw the reviews and figured I'd give it a shot. 

Came for brunch, it was filled but not crowded. Ordered our food found a table and waited. After 30mins I found out they lost the ticket. Without and apology they retook our order. 

Food was whatever. Not as overpriced as I thought. But yea my suspicions were correct another bland, not-so-overpriced tourist trap with limited charm. 

(My counterpart thinks I'm being nice)"
__label__2	Went to this restaurant for Dining Under the Stars with friends and had an awful experience. Our reservation was for 7:00 and didn't get our food until 9:15. Service was awful and when we asked to see a manager she was completely unresponsive. On top of that a 20% gratuity was added to our bill. The restaurant was not even busy on this particular night. I don't recommend this restaurant.
__label__2	Quality has decreased... Haven't been here in a while and decided to go there for dinner and food was very mediocre.Fried mushrooms were very over cooked and topped with a melted cheddar that were only on the middle mushrooms. Dinner came and was very bland, Caesar salad had way to much dressing and the chicken salad sandwich had no taste. Server was very polite as was the rest of the staff only wish the food was better.
__label__2	"A small rain storm causes over an over hour delay

__label__2	"The Walmart of steakhouses.
So disappointing, from 2 crappy bar drinks @ $25, to the ribeye, tough, flavorless and full of gristle. Cowboy beans, salad and bread were great though !"
__label__2	"Checkers are rude and not helpful
Prices are wrong when you get to the register
When I questioned the prices they were rude and begrudged my inquiry
checkers are rude and not helpful
Not the best selection or quality Fruit and Veggie organics 
No helpful people to find what you may be look for.
Checkers are rude and not helpful  
Oddily the Customers were nice!  That is why I gave it 2 stars.
They must have horrible Management style for the employees to be like that 
But, the price problem is rampant at every Safeway I have been to."
__label__2	"Couldnt tell u about the ice cream, couldn't get served! Small line in front of us and none of them being helped. The staff didn't actually ""work"" the counter, they just sort meandered about the area. I felt like I needed an appointment. After 5 minutes of being ignored, we went around the corner to  goodnoes. If I ran this place and was wildly understaffed, I would at least acknowledge the line of people."
__label__2	We came here excited for a Sunday morning breakfast. It was freezing in the restaurant, there were lipstick stains on the water glasses, and hair stuck to the top of the Tabasco sauce. Disappointing all around.
__label__2	A place that serves craft beer and good burgers in Brentwood, Awesome!!! Unfortunately, they failed to deliver. I like the small size of the burgers and the options you can put on them, however, they are way overpriced and the ground beef is flavorless.  Fatal flaws for a casual burger joint. Not sure how long they will last with pressure from less expensive burger places opening around town. Maybe will try again sometime. I might have gone on a off night for them.
__label__2	Went here today she was doing grab and go so the platters came out very quick I had the fried fish with the Mac and cheese candied yams and seafood salad the Mac cheese was okay I had better the candy yams and seafood salad was good too but i didn't see what the hype is about this place I had asked for tarter sauce for my fish they didn't have that nor did they have any drinks ready I don't think I would be back
__label__2	This review is for the customer service, as the sandwiches, although pricey, are good and up until my recent experience, I would recommend Panino.  However, having a problem with an order earlier this month, calling and being told a manager would call me and having zero response was a disappointment.  I followed up with two emails and still no response.  I suppose they are busy enough that local customers (or perhaps any customers) are not a priority.
__label__2	I recently moved to St Pete from NYC and at first glance I was excited for a great healthy smoothie. $14 for a smoothie and $5 for a coffee. Those prices are ridiculous compared to NYC. The coffee was regular drip not some artisan coffee. The smoothie took 30min to get because the staff was too busy talking.
__label__2	The restaurant had a strange odor, like the belt to their vacuum was burnt. The steak was dry and over seasoned. We ordered it medium, but it came very close to well done. The manager did offer to replace the steak, or give us a dessert, neither of which we could accept due to time constraints. The Caesar salad was made with iceberg lettuce, but had a good taste. The Parmesan crusted chicken was much better than the steak (how ironic at a steak joint), but still over seasoned. And the sautéed vegetables were good. No complaints about the wait staff.
__label__2	I must say I was thoroughly disappointed with my experience at the Birchwood. Where do I start...Well  it was a friends Birthday and of course as friends we wanted the experience to be amazing. They placed us in a private party room which was a plus, really enjoyed the view out the French doors from our table. Mike our server had a positive attitude and tried to get things done. Although did state this is a fancy restaurant and we try and accommodate all request.
__label__2	Pro - they sat us at midnight on a Friday without a wait. Cons - no oysters?? Food was ok. Drinks were ok. Restaurant was dirty. Staff wasn't very friendly. For the money we paid I expected a lot better experience.
__label__2	Disappointed that a delivery order did not arrive sealed.  The bags for each order were not rolled down and open to the air.  The large bag was bit sealed. This seems less than optimal when orders are being delivered.
__label__2	"The poke bowl isn't great. Very small meat portions, I ordered eel (which is $1 extra) and a fish. I only got one small filet of eel and about 5 tiny pieces of fish. The bowl had way more rice than what was necessary, and the bottom was absolutely covered in the sauce to the point where I couldn't eat the rice. The fish and eel weren't bad, but it's definitely not worth the price when a good sashimi lunch is less than $14.

Their bubble tea is good though"
__label__2	The level of care here has changed considerably since my first visit in 2013. It seems the staff is overworked or overwhelmed and it seems the patient quantity is too large for what they are able to handle/facilitate efficiently. I have also experienced the front staff as being unprofessional and rude more than a few times, although there have been maybe one or two visits in which I was greeted by a professional, upbeat, and personal individual. Rare, but pleasant. Dr. O'brien and Rowbotham are always super thorough and have always provided me with thorough visits and information.
__label__2	"I've been here a couple of times and wasn't impressed either time. Bland seafood for the price.

The good - friendly service both times i was here.

The so-so - the food. I've tried the fried shrimp, fried fish, scallops, scampi, and a mahi special. None were impressive. All edible, but not with the price.

The bad - value for the prices."
__label__2	"Bottom Line Up Front:  Service was atrocious - Pizza was OK.
My wife and I arrived and sat a table outside.  The three servers assigned to the outside tables kept looking at us and passing our table without a word.  We finally flagged down the hostess who said she would get us our server.  Instead of a server we got a guy from the kitchen who got us our drinks, took our order and even delivered the food...the only time we saw a server was when he delivered the check...how nice of him!
That was our first and only time at this place."
__label__2	"How hard is it to get your hoagie done the way you ordered correct? 

Go to Vecrhio's and find out."
__label__2	I wish I could give a good review. Their rooftop area was cool and the service was good. But... the food was awful. Everything cold. Soup was cold and bland. The pimento grilled cheese was cold and the cheese tasted like cream cheese spread. And lastly, it was a chilly night and we wanted coffee after dinner. They had no coffee or tea. That seems like a very basic thing that every restaurant should have. If I give them another chance I'll review again.
__label__2	There were two positives about this hotel: the location and the price. It's close to Biosphere 2 and cheap for a night. The actual hotel is pretty run down and dirty. We had to find a grocery store at 10 o'clock at night to buy Lysol wipes so we could clean our own bathroom. There is no way we were using a toilet that had someone's pubes all over it!
__label__2	This is my first review, so here it goes!  The quality of the sound in the picture was great.  The staff is not the friendliest but who would be making minimum wage. Just like any other movie theater the food is overpriced.
__label__2	First visit wasn't anything to write home about but stopped in for appetizers. The calamari was awful and when they ask if everything was okay we were just ignored by management. We will never go there again
__label__2	"Poop on a toilet seat. Disgusting, unacceptable & awful to see in women's bathroom on a Friday evening...No wonder why it smelled like $hit. Also, the brut champagne was very disappointing - no bubbliness and cheap; it didn't warrant the price paid IMO. I would rather drink a beer in comparison, but I wanted to treat myself to something ""nice."""
__label__2	A lovely atmosphere complete with a wood burning fireplace. We really wanted to like this place. However the coq au vin tasted like it could have come out of a can.  Over cooked stew with mushy veggies and gravy.   The French onion soup was ok, but we have had much better and it was overpriced. We did not try the sweet crepes and perhaps they would be better.   Too bad. I wished it had been better.
__label__2	"I was unimpressed.  We had the horchata which tasted like regular milk, fajitas that had zero flavor and cheese enchiladas which were not enjoyable either. 

The only bright spot was our waiter who was prompt in getting our food and drinks but aside from that the place is below average."
__label__2	"Really really Bad service 
Bad food burnt dry wings
Soggy seafood 
Didn't honor happy hour prices."
__label__2	"Employees were nice

Ordered large fry and 3 burgers
My burger was a yumiyum or something like that
Teriyaki glazed mushrooms , all I could taste was salt. I like salt on my burger but not that much. Couldn't taste the mushrooms or teriyaki at all. 
Fry's were done early and sat on the counter until our burgers were ready. By the time we got our order the frys were only warm. 
Unfortunately probably not going back. 
You could tell the employees cared and were trying , I attribute our experience to poor training."
__label__2	This store is chronically understaffed. We have been going there several frequently recently and typically have to wait 20-30 minutes to get anyone to help. Will go elsewhere from now on
__label__2	good is typical for an IHOP, but the staff is completely useless.  the help must be the rejects of all other restaraunts from Washington Square West.
__label__2	"We waited an hour for our appetizers despite the restaurant not being especially crowded. Our entrees came 20 minutes after that and were absolutely the size of appetizers: tasty but tiny and unsubstantial. 
The service was poor and only ever apologetic. 
In short, everything arrived too little and too late. 
NOLA has many, many other places that I would recommend before Saba. 
It tries too hard to be upscale and ultimately doesn't succeed at being even a decent place to eat."
__label__2	I ordered online with 45 minutes ahead. I got 4 souffles 3 of them were spinach and artichoke and the other one was  a bacon one. I paid over $20 to find out they were burned. You go to Panera's for a decent meal. Very disappointed.
__label__2	Music was amazing, sound was outstanding. The food not so much. Go to listen to the music but find another place to eat. Drinks were decent but service was not so awesome.
__label__2	This place has great food and wing but the service sucks!!!!!!!  Every waitress in this place should be fired!!!!  They are rude, slow, and mess the orders every time I go in!! The bartenders are ok but the waitresses are horrible!!!!!!!!
__label__2	Having several choices in the area we picked this this place because of the nice outside seating. That saying. The food was just OK. My burger didn't have all the ingredients on it that were advertised in the menu, the waitress looked at me like I was nuts when I complained my bacon and blue burger was missing the bacon. Rolled her eyes when we asked for water. Had to get another waitress to run my credit card after waiting for ten minutes.
__label__2	This RV park is very noisy. You hear the train and the 101 freeway all day and ALL night long. The park does not allow campfires and the spots are narrow. It's a couple of miles to State Street, Zoo, beach etc. The surrounding neighborhood is questionable, we didn't feel safe at night leaving the park. The only positive comment would be that the park managers were friendly and the park does have wifi with a good signal.
__label__2	"Went for a group dinner - it took 45 mins for food to arrive, order was missing condiments 

Soup quality is questionable - conch chowder was practically missing conch

Fish sandwich was the only thing that earned two stars 

Overall a decent place given its proximity to clearwater"
__label__2	I'm definitely too old for this place, but if you are looking for a cheap bar with decent music, and don't mind being groped while you try to dance with your friends, then this is the spot for you.  We had to keep re-locating because there were a lot of guys that would not take no for an answer.  The music was fun, and it didn't get too hot or too crowded, but I wouldn't recommend going here unless you are pretty drunk.
__label__2	The music last night was good. My drink was good but I paid $10 for two sips of a martini. What I didn't like was that the bartender was trying to get us to leave the bar. He gave us our bill and told us we could go sit at one of the tables. He didn't even ask if we were done drinking.
__label__2	The food was absolutely amazing, but the service was horrible! I would never go back because of the lack of service. When u order a glass of wine to go with dinner and get it 20 minutes after you are finished is just wrong!!!!! Apparently Mr. Brennan needs to hire more help!!!'n
__label__2	"Have always loved the food at Bristol's but the crab cakes seemed to have shrunk quite a bit and our service was awful and they sat us next to the kitchen so we could see all the servers slipping and sliding on the dirty floors. Such a disappointment.
I try to be understanding with all the Covid restrictions and staff shortages but when your server spends more time cleaning glasses than checking g on his tables you have a problem."
__label__2	This place used to have great customer service and reasonably priced food. Now it's constantly letting me down. Food is just mediocre and overpriced and it has on several occasions taken 20-30 minutes to get a sandwich. Even when it's not busy, service is slow.
__label__2	Ive only gone here a few times since it's so close to my house whenever I crave wings and beer. All 3 times the beer was not very cold even after trying a few different beers none were cold. The wings taste like they are drowned in vinegar. The last time I ordered them with light sauce but they taste the same. I left a pair of sunglasses there...which is my fault....went back to get them and of course they were gone.
__label__2	I can't figure out the ratings on this place.  Compared to other places in NOLA - I would avoid this.  It is nothing special.  Food was average at best.  It was also dirty.  Multiple tables not cleaned off.  Multiple employees having personal conversations versus cleaning things up.  You could tell in the first two minutes that the place isn't well managed and it didn't get any better during dinner.  We have had multiple 4-5 star experiences during our trip and this one clearly didn't compare
__label__2	"Great venue. 
Crowded for the square footage."
__label__2	Mediocre breakfast.  Ours lacked flavor all the way around.  Our server was not very good either, messing up orders and such.  They have good potential, but I think they feed too many people a day and the quality loses out to the quantity.
__label__2	Second visit, all was fine on first trip. This time, gross experience- big black hair in my son's lemonade. Then his burger comes out with another big black hair! Photo attached.  Also, the chicken was so overdone that it should never have left the kitchen with any quality control, total rubber and no self respecting chef would serve it.   See second photo.  No idea what happened here, must be major kitchen issues.
__label__2	"I really want to like this place, it has so much potential but in the end it always disappoints.

Decor is great, the AlleyKat spicy beer on tap is sublime, no kids allowed makes it my kind of heaven....

BUT food is bland and for those who think they are the best poboy sandwiches, please compare them to something from Louisiana rather than the subway on the corner."
__label__2	"The food was okay. The service is something i would love to tell more about. The waitress was absolutely laud back, oblivious and with attitude. I had to wait quite a long time before i could finally ask for the knife to start eating my meal. Then had to wait for a long while before the waitress finally took my credit card so i could get outta here. Not coming back for sure. Oh, and no ""Good evening"" or ""Thank you! Have a good night!"" Just a young gal standing completely in her thoughts... Hostess?..."
__label__2	"What is with hotels not putting drawers in the room. I like to unpack my things not just leave them on my suitcase. I have this complaint about many hotels but never has it been this bad. Only one drawer in the entire room. The front desk said that when they remodeled the rooms the took the drawers out. WHY?

Otherwise the hotel is fine not great not bad. If it wasn't for my Marriott reward points this would not be worth it. I am a Marriott fan and this location is good just need management to step it up a little to make this a decent place."
__label__2	"Service and food were a let down tonight.  Our food came out while are drinks were empty and stayed that way the entire meal.  The tenders breading was falling off of every piece.  Three people got the tenders and all were the same.  

This place has always had issues with service.  Really think it is a management issue.  Seem under staffed."
__label__2	Slowest service and the should look into cleaning their floor. I love Steak N' Shake and was quite disappointed in this location.
__label__2	My husband and I have been coming here for years. We always liked the happy hour special, especially the cheddar burger. A couple of times the bar was full, so we sat at a little bar with two seats at the end, next to the doorway to gallos, just until seats opened up at the bar. This was never an issue before. For some reason, the same bartender that's been serving us for years refused to serve us the happy hour special. Because of the awful treatment and her rudeness, we will never go back there again.
__label__2	Room itself was fine (disappointed about no bath tub, though). But what was so bad was that they started construction right outside my bedroom window w/ terrible drilling sound before 8 am. So not the way to start my vacation in Santa Barbara! Unfriendly check in experience; not a hint of smile in her face; v unwelcomed.  A great location is the only plus.
__label__2	The fishing ships are decent here I didn't really enjoy anything else besides the beer And drinks espresso martinis were water down.
__label__2	Im personally a fan of Hilton. My friend got good rates here for our weekend in STL. The room was clean it just seemed... idk outdated? Maybe it was the location and the hotel. I would stay here again but not by choice. Also, the coffee stand by the front desk serves Starbucks, but it doesnt taste the same. Also their baked goods are definitely NOT Starbucks!
__label__2	"I went into the store to see about upgrading my series one Apple Watch to a series two, that's not something that Apple does, and instead of telling me that directly they made up a story about how I can ""recycle my watch for money"" which does not exist through Apple for Apple watches."
__label__2	"Over priced and long wait for mediocre food. 

We ordered the chicken souvlaki plate at $19 and not only did it take a long time the chicken was bitter tasting with too much lemon. 

We did like that it was family run, but seemed short staffed in the kitchen."
__label__2	Have tried First Watch twice. While the menu looks good, the execution is mediocre. Omelettes are under-filled and rubbery. Pancakes are oversized and caky. Sandwiches are small and stingy, filling-wise. Due to a front-of-the-house/back-of-the-house system, food is delivered by a person unempowered to get you anything else you need, leaving you searching for your server. Good coffee, however, served in a personal pot, which is always a plus.
__label__2	"Unfortunately my experiences at Surf Shack are progressively getting worse. Quality and consistency are lacking.  Maybe it's just on Taco Thursday.  My most recent experience ordering to-go was sub-par. One taco was missing from my order, another missing avocado which is a main ingredient. Then when I called to speak with a manager about my experiences,  her view of ""service recovery"" was to give me a free taco next time,  which is ultimately the taco I already paid for. Overall, I'm lowering my expectations for this restaurant."
__label__2	Pretty cool place but people treated my friends very unprofessionally barley checking on us if we want food and when we finally got it only had like 20 minutes to eat very sad cause I liked it. But after all that they messed up splitting the check 3 ways and made my comrade upset. And they were very Unsympathetic even tho their customer service is supposed to bed good. I've only been there 3 times and each time it has gotten worse.
__label__2	I came here to just get sushi.  The sushi was bad!  Not worth my time & money!  Big huge rolls, and the fish looked bad!  The shrimp tempura was not made fresh!  Must remind myself to get sushi at sushi restaurants not supermarkets!
__label__2	I want to like this place; it's in a great location, lovely outdoor patio, interesting tequila/drink menu.  However, the food and service are usually a disappointment.  Food has always seemed a little off- sometimes texture, seasoning, quality or done-ness of the proteins.  Waitstaff are friendly, but often seem underinformed (ex. on the specials) or rushed.  I suppose it'd still be a good spot for a couple drinks with friends.
__label__2	"I used to come here a lot but now they  are going down hill and the prices are going
up hill on Thanksgiving had a water pump put in 2010 Chevy charge me $1,000 and the reserve tank was still very filthy that wasn't worth it way too much"
__label__2	"Food is good and soda machine is awesome. Service is pretty piss poor. Last two times I have been in this place, gave me the wrong order and see ya..... I order through the app several times and I come in......
""ummmmm I forgot to put paper in the printer""..... Just disappointing service.... No knocks on the wings though"
__label__2	We used to love Caine's. Simple options with the kids made ordering for everyone a breeze. But it seems like the strips keep getting smaller. And today the portion of fries was like half what we usually get and they weren't cooked all the way. We asked for extra sauces for all of the meals and they gave us ketchup? Not sure how that request got lost in translation.. just kindve expensive for such small portions and undercooked fries. I included a picture. All 3 meals looked the same so I don't think it was a fluke. ?
__label__2	I've really tried to like this place especially because of its location and nice decor, however, there service is seriously slow and my orders never come out right. The first time they completely messed up my order of lox and cream cheese by giving me the wrong bagel and then putting the lox and cream cheese only on top of the bagel rather than in the middle. I thought maybe this was due to growing pains since they had just started. But then the last two times they put close to NO cream cheese on my bagel. Steins is still better!
__label__2	My son and I came in at 10:30am on a Tuesday for breakfast. The service was really bad and there wasn't very many people in there at the time. I found myself wondering what the waitress was doing because I barely saw her in the dining room. Our food came and my poached eggs were served in a bowl filled with water. The biscuit for my biscuits and gravy wasn't very good but the hash browns were very fresh. All in all we won't go back.
__label__2	Beautiful hotel but rooms Nasty!  Sami Bartels in management was rude & dismissive.  Poor customer service.  I will not stay again.
__label__2	Very slow, half of my order was incorrect or not served to me, and the food was only sub par. Does not compare to other IHOP's I have gone to in the past.
__label__2	"The poboys here are ok. I tried the fried crawfish and fried oysters. I thought it was cool that I was able to do half and half here. They don't really give a lot of the ""meat"" part, which sucks cos of the price that you're paying. Also, the service here was terrible. It took forever for my sandwich to come out. They weren't that busy, but there was only one person who was taking the order/serving the food, and then probably just one person running the kitchen (so it felt like)."
__label__2	Ok food 5 stars but other issues out weigh that. Restaurants has a dirty feel but I did look past that. My main problem I witnessed the cashier replace the bag in the trash can and pick trash can up return it to its place and then go grab food to deliver to two different table. NEVER WASHED HANDS! Another man steps up to cash register take his index fix runs it under his nose and then goes and gets MY food and delivers it to my table. Not ok!! Again food 5 stars but the fact I have auto immune disease and witnessing their habits probably won't be back.
__label__2	Even before COVID the chances of getting someone to answer the phone there is relatively the same odds as winning the lottery.
__label__2	No military discount on Veterans Day! You will also be charged .50 when you ask for cash back.
__label__2	Yuck!!! My family and I just left due to 2 non service dogs being allowed in. I will not be back. I'd rather drive to Dairy Queen.
__label__2	Excellent service....very fast!!  The food was nothing special.  Plenty of food but kinda drab. The salsa was like bottled and chips were thick and hard.  The mixed drinks were no good at all.  Waste of money. They were not made right and very weak. My boyfriend's LIIT was even warm!  I got what ended up being a thawed frozen pina colada.
__label__2	"Although I love the food I have to give it a poor rating.  I'm not confident the place would pass a health inspection.  One of the two workers behind the counter acts as both cashier and sandwich maker without ever washing his hands.  

A look on the Philadelphia Department of Health website revealed numerous violations from a November 2012 inspection, including cigarette butt in sink, no paper towels in bathroom, mouse droppings (repeat offense) and food stored at improper temperatures.  

Shape up Peter McAndrews!"
__label__2	The atmosphere is good but the food is mediocre. We got the lobster Mac but was not worth it being $18. The amount was very less, tasted more flour-y than cheesy and barely had any lobster in it.
__label__2	I previously  gave 4 stars just fyi. My boyfriend got us crab cakes today ...i literally said...these are hushpuppies. There were strings of crab meat but tasted nothing of crab literally ONLY breading. Its hit or miss with me.sad because they have been there forever.
__label__2	"Food is ok. Cleanliness is borderline passable. 

What isn't passable is playing FOX News coverage of the CT school shooting on a Saturday afternoon when many parents with kindergarten-aged children are in the restaurant eating. 

I don't know what's worse: the poor choice of management or that none of the parents are complaining."
__label__2	"Called for delivery over an hour before closing, and they said: ""Well it would take a long time to get there because we're closing up."" I asked, ""you're closing up now even though you're open for another hour?"" She said, ""yes because we have to sweep."" Really? Lame excuse. No more business from me!! Very disappointing. 

Two stars because I like the product, but I'm very annoyed with orders not being taken an hour before closing. Closing early on a SATURDAY?! Bad business!!!!"
__label__2	Carol C is dumb. She did not understand my simple order. However, these chocolates are dank. There was a bit of a wait. The chocolates are cheaper then you'd expect.
__label__2	Came here on a Monday night at around 7pm and was told that the wait would be around 2 hours for a table of 2 or around 35 minutes for the kitchen view bar. With that wait time and the amount of reviews on yelp, I had high expectations. I only ordered the gnocchi and was quite disappointed at how it turned out. It was way too salty in my opinion, and it's very overpriced for what you get. Definitely a disappointing experience here.
__label__2	The two stars are for the two trainers I interacted with while at the kirkwood location. After receiving a promotional email for a six week program I booked a consultation for my orientation. Since I do not live close by I choose the later time period offered and planned around traffic. I received a confirmation email and was super excited to jump start on my fitness in the new year. After arriving I was informed that there was an error in the automated emailing system and there were no longer any open spots for the program. The best they could offer was a two week trial period for approx $200. Very disappointing experience.
__label__2	"While in town for a wedding, we ordered a few  cheesesteaks to go. I was surprisingly disappointed (especially given the restaurants rating). The cheesesteaks was truly just so-so. I ordered mine with Wiz and it was drowning in cheese. I couldn't even taste anything else. 
We also had them deliver as we were getting ready for the wedding and it took over an hour (we were only 1 mile away) which was frustrating as well. 
Too many other options in the city. I wouldn't go back."
__label__2	Definitely nothing to write home about. I wouldn't go again on my volition. It wasn't bad just not great . I ordered a grits specialty bowl. It was good, I thought small and underwhelming. I sampled a sweet potato French fry that was too firm and flavorless. I also tested a fried green tomato that was also harder and had no flavor . I think this place is popular because its new , not because the food is good.
__label__2	I love Baskin Robbins ice cream and have been a fan since I was a little kid.  The ice cream here was as good as ever... but the shop was filthy...and with only one person working, it took forever to be served.  The service was understandable in these times, but being filthy is inexcusable.
__label__2	I wasn't impressed with my experience buying a car here. Most of what was promised wasn't delivered and they seemed very secretive and vague in answering my questions. The experience reminded me of dealing with a sketchy used car lot.
__label__2	Customer service is lacking today.  Maybe I am old fashioned but I sort of expected the cashier to get off her cell phone and interact with me when I picked up my clothes.  Instead, she continued her phone conversation as if I were not even there.
__label__2	Good thing you can have it delivered through doorstepdelivery.com If ordering at restaurant they have Slow service. Took forever for food to come out. Food was good though. Parking is ok if you park in the garage and come up escalator.
__label__2	I ate there today for lunch and had the finger steaks. They were really not good. Meat was not tender and the breading was boring. Our waitress was adequate but not very friendly. Atmosphere was ok. Wouldn't go back.
__label__2	I really wanted to like this place. Super nice and friendly family owns it and aims to please the customers. Unfortunately the espresso was bad and the food is prepackaged. The price was good but I would rather pay double and have real fresh food and better coffee. Get intelligentsia beans and make people want to come for the coffee!!!
__label__2	Does panera understand that without a customer they have no business. The lines are huge, youre server for food walks aimlessly looking for you.  Need sugar free gluten free paleo options would make it super duper!
__label__2	Went here tonight and was really really disappointed, I am visiting my family and we went here for a quick bite. I ordered the shrimp and boudin. It was horrible. No flavor. Tasted old old old. I won't be back.
__label__2	The food was average and the staff especially short male with glasses was extremely rude an unprofessional because he was inattentive to guest needs.
__label__2	It's sad to see this store go downhill.  Drive up and the landscaping is all overgrown and shabby.  Walk in and the store is dreary and unappealing.  I couldn't wait to get out of there, low inventory, small staff, just not a place you want to stay and look around at all.
__label__2	Although I'm thankful they fit me in for a color and cut last minute, it wasn't worth the small fortune they charged me for the services.  The salon has poor lighting and when I got home I realized the stylist had missed a huge section of roots in the front! I now have to go back to have it fixed.  Huge rookie mistake from someone doing hair for 30 years.  The salon was dirty and cluttered, although had good ambiance aside from that.  Elevations was definitely not worth the $160 charged for  color, lowlights and cut.
__label__2	I was craving bbq, and have been to this location in the past. This time was unbelievably frustrating and a huge waste of time. After waiting for a table for 30 min, we were seated and ordered. Got drinks and then our waiter Hector just dissapeard. We sat there for 30 min, he never checked on us or refiled drinks. After we spoke to manager, Hector came back and grabbed out empty cups..never apologized or looked us in the eye. After 10 more min we got up and walked out.
__label__2	"Concept- Genious or Not?

At first, I thought *genious*  after eating my pathetic concoctions created by my own hands. I just ate some of the worst tasting dishes in my life and have no one to blame but myself. Then I thought *Not* after leaving the place knowing I will probably not return to subject myself to my own inept ability to co- mingle ingredients.

Aside from the meal, Altai lacked in ambience and service. Lucky for them I was so preoccupied with my own debacle I just wrote the meal off as a loss onto thine self."
__label__2	Had dinner here the other night. The only good thing about our experience was the waitress who was very good. The food is extremely over priced. Many of the extremely over priced entrees don't even include pasta. My girlfriend ordered a side of pasta and asked for white wine sauce with it. It was 16 bucks and some of the spaghetti was clumped together and the sauce was genric tasting
__label__2	Their food is unseasoned but the restaurant was clean and staff was questionable. I felt out of place there.
__label__2	I've eaten at the blue tortilla many times over the years.  So yesterday, when we needed a place for dinner, I was comfortable recommending it to the people I was with.  Well, we ate there.  The food was unremarkable.  Totally edible, tasted good, but unremarkable. The only thing remarkable was the prices.  My son got two tacos for $17.  They were about five bites of food each.  We had to get him another meal.  They need to be of greater value before I could eat there again.
__label__2	I made an appointment for a dip manicure -- was told the price would be $45. The appointment took 90 minutes for a manicure -- I understand places are short on staff BUT the tech completed a pedicure on another guest during my appointment before returning back to me. I was then charged $55 for the service. I will not be returning
__label__2	"We thought that we paid prime dollar for a  BBQ sandwich that was dry, when we asked for a little more barbecue sauce they said it would be $.50 extra. Their rationale was that people order extra barbecue sauce and don't eat it.

Great place if you want to listen to screaming kids everywhere.

We won't be back"
__label__2	The ice cream is fine, but the service was not impressive. When the line is 10-deep, the servers should really cut the chitchat and try to keep things moving. I'll stick with Mueller's on Chews Landing Road instead.
__label__2	We got it for $70/night ($88 w/ all of the fees and taxes) on priceline negotiator.  The parking is hella expensive ($32/night).  Yikes.  The hotel is busy and has a great location, but it is boring.  The decor in the rooms is also hideous, but we have a nice view.  The service could be better.
__label__2	"Have visited Sup 4 or 5 times before with an usual positive experience..  Chose the broccoli cheese soup (for the first time) and was TERRIBLY  disappointed in the thin consistency.  It's alarming ""ORANGE"" color made me think that they were using powdered cheese to make the soup.  Will never order this one again!!   Also, the broccoli ""flowerets"" were about 4"" in diameter!  ""Cajun"" egg salad was OK -- not a hit."
__label__2	The venue in itself is not bad. It intimate. However there are several support columns that will block you view. Now the issue I had was the valet parking. After the show, it was well over 2 hours before we were able to retrieve our cars. And that was because we walked (a group of about 20 ppl) and followed the valet drivers to get our car for a garage a block away. I would so recommend this auditorium but not the valet parking.
__label__2	We went here and the place was dead. Yet it still took us 10 minutes to get a drink because the bartender was standing there talking to his friend then he went to the back and didn't come back for a while. The bathrooms were disgusting as disgusting could be. Needless to say, we didn't stay long. Had one beer and left. Not impressed with the service whatsoever.
__label__2	Went here for a birthday, and the mariachi were great but the food and service; not so much.  I live in Jacksonville and can't believe I drove all this way just to eat mediocre food.  I understand that this place used to be really good, but they missed the mark on my visit.  I don't usually give uninspired food or bad service a second chance.
__label__2	Didn't want to wait in line at Central Grocery. I decided to try the Muffalata at Butcher. That was a mistake. Their Muffalata was very bland. Their was only one olive on the whole sandwich. I also tried the boudin and the cubano. Again both bland. Two stars for the friendly service.
__label__2	I came from out of town looking for something to eat as I had been traveling all day. I stumbled upon Affamatos and hoped to be able to try it. Unfortunately, the restaurant closed at 11 on Saturday night. We arrived at 10:38 and was told that they had already cleaned off the grill.  I was confused because there was still 22 min left. If you want close early, I guess that is fine, but don't advertise staying open until 11 if you really close at 10:30. Disappointed and probably won't frequent there again.
__label__2	"On a recent visit I got a sales pitch for their new line of dog food while waiting (I guess) for somebody who knew how to run the register.  I ended up walking out.
They weren't especially busy -- and this just pushes one of my big buttons, namely
trying to sell you one thing, and ignoring what you actually came there for.

A nice little neighborhood nursery on this side of town would certainly be nice,
but i'll be going elsewhere in the future."
__label__2	"Visiting the city of Philadelphia, we decided to look for a place to have breakfast, we chose this place because of the ""good"" reviews it has, but honestly it was not what I expected, from my point of view the ingredients they use are not of good/high quality for the price that they charge, I was expecting something healthier and more delicious.

What I do recommend is the coffee they have, although they should include almond milk."
__label__2	First off, this place looks very sterile (white walls, white floor, white everything). The sushi isn't that good and it's really expensive. I would not go back!
__label__2	"I have no idea how this place has such a high rating. I had a Gyro, which to me is pretty basic, and it was one of the worst I've ever tasted. 
The meat was ok, but the pita was soaked in butter and greasy. The Tzatziki tasked like sour cream and looked like it too. Any there was no feta on it. 
Fries were obviously frozen and were very bland. 

Perhaps other things on the menu are much better."
__label__2	After reading all the great reviews we decided to try this place out and were so disappointed. First of all this place is super tiny and it's crammed with a plethora of people. No room to walk! And the breakfast was bland! There are so many good brunch places in the French Quarter so I definitely wouldn't go back.
__label__2	Watch your change, just ordered Togo and total was 7.04 and got $12 back from a $20 I just took the difference out of the tip but I won't be back..
__label__2	As a Marriott platinum elite member I spend 150+ nights in Marriotts in any given year. This place is a dump. Low end all the way around. They could use some serious renovations. I arrived, looked around, canceled my reservation and then went up the road to the Courtyard. For a $100 a night I guess it would do. Just not what you'd normally expect from a Marriott. No comment on the service as I wasn't there long enough to experience it.
__label__2	"Their food is tasty--I'd give them 5... just avoid deliveries and pick-up orders! My pre-arranged pick-up order was not even begun before I arrived at the arranged time; had to wait an additional 20 minutes for preparation. A delivery arranged via a third-party app (Beyond Menu) was never processed because Ali Baba ""had no delivery service available"" that night! Ali Baba staff did not bother to notify us that no food would delivered; we only found out when we called 80 minutes later to get ETA! Very poor customer service!!!"
__label__2	"I like shopping at Ross, but this Ross.. I don't even know what to say. 

There was precious little in the way of organization of sizes, the store was an absolute mess. I know, it's just after Christmas, so that might account for some of it, but LORDY! Spend some of your valuable time out on the floor getting it spruced up. 

I did buy a dress and a shirt for $30, so I can't truly complain, but really... this place was a disaster, especially in their check out area."
__label__2	When i first started coming here, they were so nice and did a great job. But over the past 4 months or so ive seen a lot of turn over and the owner is always yelling at her employees.  Twice i heard her disrespect clients. You can definitely go elsewhere and get a less expensive mani/pedi and not have to listen to her yelling at her employees or disrespecting clients.
__label__2	"Food: 2
Decor: 2.5
Ambiance: 3
Service: 1
Value: 2

We've tried it twice. There will not be a third. Terrible service, and sick afterwards."
__label__2	I ordered the meatballs as an appetizer on last Friday. They normally taste fresh, real and authentic, but this time around they tasted fake and grocery store bought...
__label__2	Got drinks here that were decent but way overpriced. The food was okay, it wasn't bad by any means but nothing I'm in a hurry to eat again. The frozen bar counter was cool and the service was good.
__label__2	Was always my favorite Thai restaurant next to Thai Spice in Greenwood. Now that they've remodeled and changed it to fast food style where you order at the front and then have to take a number on a stand to your table it's really lost it's charm. The food was good but just not quite the same consistency. The new tables and décor look nice but the fast food entrance and soda machine took away from a pleasant dining experience.
__label__2	Was hoping to find a good pizza place close to us. It smelled good walking in so I was hopeful. In terms of atmosphere there was a pretty awkward silence since there was no music or sound coming for the TV's. The food was nothing to write home about. The garlic cheese bread was ok once you peeled the thick layer of rubbery cheese off. My husband got the meat lovers and I a custom made pie. The taste reminded us of walmart frozen pizzas. This was very disappointing considering the price. The service was fine but we're better of just buying from a grocery store or dominos.
__label__2	"Probably has one of the best hot and sour soups I've tasted. Even better than some legitimate Thai restaurants. Maybe it's the spicy kick.

Steak and Eggs combo was good too...more the steak and hash browns. Eggs tasted a little like cardboard.

The Grilled Chicken Breast Foccacia (forgot if that's what it's called) - sounds better on the menu than it tastes. and it was too big to eat that it just fell apart.

Overall: 2 stars (leaning on 2.5 just for the soup :)"
__label__2	I don't live in Nashville -- we got a recommendation from one of the guys working at the hotel valet and decided to give it a try. Burger was pretty good, but fries were cold. Food was decent, but I'm not sure I would come back here again if I were in town again. Nothing special here, but maybe their breakfast items are better. My experience was just mediocre.
__label__2	"So... they literally shut the lights off on us and so we went to redeem our tickets and we were the second in line and the guy told us ""we're closed."" And that's why we will be heading to The Loop when it opens... hopefully it will have a little bit better customer service. It would have taken us two seconds for us you pick out our crappy prizes after spending $100 in games tonight. Thanks Coconut."
__label__2	Unfortunately, the food wasn't worth the sixty dollars that I paid... They charged my two year old twelve dollars for a bowl of pasta and butter. The shrimp was not cleaned or devained and the outside was so cluttered that I couldn't move my chair back to go use the restroom. The clam chowder was decent... All and all... Not a family friendly place and really not worth the money.
__label__2	"I've eaten waaaay more cheeseburgers from Colonial over the years than I care to admit. (Like, the delivery guys notice when I change my hairstyle.) But for a neighborhood take-out place, they were really good. 
Then I ordered one last week, and it was gross. Like, super-cheap frozen meat gross. I wondered what was up, and apparently there are new owners. 
So sad!"
__label__2	"Husband and I tried this place out when we first moved here.  As a midwest transplant, I'm a huge fan of carbs.  I'm not, however, a fan of MFM.

Service was really slow is really slow.  Be prepared to wait.

Food is only okay.  I've purchased better bagels and muffins from the over-processed/produced grocery store.

Do yourself a favor.  Go somewhere else."
__label__2	"still thinking I should have bought at Deland, better service deals.  Too late already bought at 
ocean, but might be worth the trip to Deland Florida"
__label__2	"Bartenders are great. 
Bar as a whole lacks identity.
Are they a sports bar, club, craft, Greek, dive?
Also, 0 reason an Irish Car Bomb should EVER cost $20."
__label__2	Italian hoagie.  Flavor of the onion and gratef cheese was nice but a lack of meat and over abundance of roll puts it low on my favorites list.
__label__2	Wings were nuggets, service was very intermittent, sticky table. Prices are good, food selection is good, location rules. Overall food quality isn't there and service blows. I had boneless wings and tots. The tots were good but wings were more like nuggets...their hottest sauce was also very mild.
__label__2	Terrible service. We got the crab appitizer which took an hour to come out. I gave 2 stars because the appitizer was really really amazing but everything else was terrible. Another 45 minutes for our food. Our kids fell asleep because it took so long and they couldnt stay awake to eat. My rice was burnt. Literally burnt. It was a terrible experience.
__label__2	The place is a bit of a dump, it was super hot and the service was pretty poor. Hoagie was decent, full of flavor and unique toppings. Maybe the five star reviews made my expectations unreasonable. Maybe next time I try the pizza, in the fall, when it's cooler outside. Maybe....
__label__2	I don't get it. Maybe my hopes were way too high to start with, but I didn't love it. The sausage pizza didn't have any sauce, pizza or sausage within 3 inches of the crust. It was weird. It seems really popular, so I'm guessing whoever made this pizza, was just having a bad day.
__label__2	Below average airport food. Tortilla soup was cold and way too much chicken. The salad had burnt chicken. Wish I got a sandwich somewhere...
__label__2	Loved the vibe and the openness of the place, but for the price, overall subpar (at least for lunch). Drinks were sitting at the bar too long so they were a bit watered down by the time we got them. Waiter brought the wrong meal for one of us, and then when they brought the right one - a grouper sandwich - it had no tartar sauce or pickles as indicated on the menu. I had a shrimp po boy, which was eh. Kind of disappointing. Would probably go back for drinks but not food
__label__2	Mad expensive.. It's really not that serious. On a couple of occasions, I found myself regretting I've eaten there.. Poor tummy :( otherwise, it's tasty but on the pricey side.
__label__2	Was looking forward to a delicious breakfast based on reviews. Waited no more then 10 minutes for a table () but waited about 15 for our waitress to acknowledge us and another 45 for our food (2 people in party). My waffle and eggs were cold to the touch and soggy. Waited another 20 minutes after finishing before our waitress threw our check on the table and basically ran away. The cashier gave us 20% off when I told him the food was cold, soggy, and service was incredibly slow. Still not worth ever coming back.
__label__2	Used to drive past countless others because this location was the best...hot food, made right, fast service, EXCELLENT staff. Lately I don't know what has happened but the people act like you're a giant inconvenience for showing up and the wait times are longer and longer. Getting harassed for money by the panhandlers in your drive thru doesn't help much either. No longer worth the extra drive.
__label__2	Meh is about right. If it wasn't for the convenience of them being close by and the delivery I would probably go elsewhere. I do like the shrimp in garlic sauce. The General Tso's chicken is a rip off - all breading and no meat. The fried rice lacks inspiration as do the egg rolls which are simply greasy fried cabbage rolls - no vegetables or pork in them. You can tell that this place is run on a budget. They would do better to offer better food value, like putting some real meat in the General's chicken, then they would get better reviews and more business.
__label__2	"as others have noted it took 40 minutes for our food to show up. the place was only about 20%full.

p.s. in the end I will say that my whiskey river chicken sandwich was chicken to perfection.   which is hard to do with a chicken. 

so if you don't mind the wait the food is good and hot."
__label__2	Wow what a disappointment!  The food was ok-nothing special.  I ordered the trout almandine and the soft shell crab as an appetizer.  The crab was great albeit very greasy since it was fried but still very good but again anything is good fried.  The trout was not very good, I was disappointed but the dessert was amazing.  We ordered 4 different ones and each one was excellent.  The dessert And the place itself was the highlight.   Can't see myself going back unless it's just for appetizer and dessert.
__label__2	"Why would anyone want to come here . They served me flat root bear I mean really . Waited 30 minutes for a table. Place is so loud u can't even talk . The arcade machines were broken along with the pool tables . Took 30mins to get our food. It was ok but nothing to write home about 
Just not a good experience at all"
__label__2	Yeah, this place is under construction - which is a good thing. Still $150 for a king suite. Overpriced as its a budget hotel. Best part was the breakfast which was average. Cracked tile, drywall dust, exposed outlets. I understand but this should have been disclosed when I booked it and it should be discounted price. Won't be back.
__label__2	Beware! This spot is an overpriceddddddt tourist trap FOR SUREE. The oysters were just okay, they were so tiny, the Crabcakes and sandwiches are just a no. Everything was room temp but the fries. As far as customer service and hospitality..the hostess and server were nice. The manager I believe she was she didn't announce herself was rudely forthright and unsympathetic. Won't be back.
__label__2	I'm gonna have to agree with everyone on this one. Customer service is bad, everyone seems annoyed or just ignores you. Won't be going back .
__label__2	We got our trailer for a great price and the salesman was great.  However the quality of work the they do is not worth buying a trailer for a few grand less then at another dealer.  We took our trailer out on a test run and have a list of 10+ problems for them to fix.  It was as if the trailer started falling apart as we drove down the road.  The trailer is under warranty which doesn't do much good when the service department just ignores you.  Would not recommend buying a trailer from them.
__label__2	The museum cafe is way way way over priced.  This is institutionalized price gouging.  Sanctioned by the city and by the local authorities.  It feels like it's ONLY for the people that CAN afford to come here.  Just feels like it's only FOR PROFIT for the few that controls this institution.  I understand profit taking but it's over board when a bottle of water is 3 dollars when we have to pay 20 to get in!
__label__2	The store should ensure that customers are wearing a mask. On Sunday 1/31/21 there was a family in line without a mask and they were allowed to remain, while others had on mask. Also, the cashier should not be touching sandwiches with same gloves he is running the register with. This is for the safety of everyone. Hoping the service/safety improves as the food is very good. I
__label__2	Haven't been to this stand in some time but my son wanted a corn dog looks like they shrunk he was happy. I wasn't to pleased.
__label__2	"Like all post offices, they never seem to have enough employees actually working during the bust times.

My biggest complaint, however, is that my mail carrier consistently delivers my packages to my neighbor. I've reported it at least a half dozen times and nothing has changed. I don't want someone to be fired, but if their job is to deliver mail they need to be able to deliver it accurately, especially after getting feedback that they're not doing so."
__label__2	I had a very bad meal at this restaurant.  I ordered the 14 oz strip steak medium rare as part of a takeout order.  The steak was totally sizzled with a thick layer of black carbon on both sides.  All but inedible.  I will not order there again.
__label__2	Where do I begin with this review I was introduced to Moe's in Garden City. When I realize that they was another Moe's in Jersey I was excited because the food is good quality for inexpensive price. However when I walked into this location I was greeted with a very greasy floor. Not letting that deter me I continue, the food  display area was not much better (granted it was later in the evening) it was very little food displayed and what was displayed did not look appetizing. I was completely disappointed with this location.
__label__2	Great service and good looking tacos but lacking flavor, spices well as pricey. We ordered lots of stuff and the most disappointing item were the plantains. If your a tourist avoid this place all together and go to los agaves you won't regret it. Just tastes like some is trying but may not be rich in the cultural background.
__label__2	It is pretty much one of the lower quality Jack In the Box's going. Tacos are almost  always over cooked to the point of the meat being cooked out and shells being has hard as a razor.
__label__2	Food ok. Corn fritters the best thing we had. Great quick service which we needed to get to the Elvis show. decent food if you don't want to drive into downtown.
__label__2	I was in last night for the last half of the colts game. I hadn't been in for a few month's since there was a management change for the worse! The waiter was more interested in cleaning off empty tables instead of taking care of customers that were still there. I Use to go at least once a week and always had a good experience. I would take my family there as well, but not anymore I gave it another chance after the management change. The restroom was in desperate need of some cleaning!
__label__2	Really wanted to like this place. Phat Pig made me nauseous. Getting sick just thinking about it. Really disappointed.
__label__2	Typical chain haircut establishment with relatively overpriced services that will leave you looking mediocre at best. My last haircut here was right after I moved to the area and was still scoping out an actual barber. I made the mistake of going here, and the stylist weed whacked my hair. The haircut didn't even make sense for the portions and chunks that she left. I would stay away at all cost, as there are actually very good real barber shops nearby and in Plainfield that offer excellent cuts for a fraction of the cost.
__label__2	"Quiet place, though could get very loud if busy. Decor could use some sprucing up.

Food was very tasty, but the prices were high for what was served.  We used a Groupon deal and found that with that discount, it was a reasonable price.

The floor was sticky in many areas, which causes question of the overall cleanliness."
__label__2	Disappointing. The food was great as always, but our favorite dishes are almost twice what they used to cost and some are gone from the menu entirely. Took forever for our meal to come to the table. Beer selection was sparse.
__label__2	Staff was very nice but first hotel room was very dated and had horrible mildew smell and candy wrappers on the floor.  Switched Room.... odor less severe but still there.  The linens have been updated but rest of room had not been.  Dirty Grout... Rusted light fixtures.  Again though/ stsff was very kind
__label__2	I want to start off by saying my waitress  was absolutely amazing!!! My mom came for the first time and ordered pick your own for $12.99. I must say I'm so disappointed in the food. It was ok but, definitely not worth there money.
__label__2	I have been at a ton of chipotles over the years. This was one of he worst. I ordered 4 items for my family. 3 of the 4 had issues. My burrito was falling apart as they rolled it, my daughter's quesadilla was made incorrectly and the chips were stale. Place was very busy at 8pm at night. Staff was friendly.
__label__2	I can't believe after all the years of coming here I have never written a review. This has got to be one of the worst Walmart stores I have ever been in. If they didn't sell the brand of cat food I buy, I probably wouldn't come here. Almost all the cashiers are rude, try to say hello and get the stink eye. The bathrooms are always messy and the parking lot always has carts everywhere. Oh yeah, by the way, the little computers in the filter finder area, have dead batteries and have for about a year now.
__label__2	A free massage would help me to have a better experience would be nice. I had that massage on my birthday as a gift and my day was pretty much ruined by the masseuse's bad behavior. I mean she was unprofessional and it was embarrassing. The massage parlor is actually in the same shopping center as my son's job, so I would love to give your store another chance to impress me. Thanks.
__label__2	First time here. Food was ok. I just didn't like all of the gnats flying around. I told who I think is the manager and he said, yes, sorry about the bugs. I'm actually still in the restaurant. We have asked for to-go containers.  Because the bugs have gotten worse since the food has arrived. Probably won't be back. It's a shame. This place has beautiful decor. Just only expect bugs at picnics.
__label__2	Friendly staff. Basic hotel room. Small casino. Cigarette burns in the blankets and sheets in the non smoking room. Waking up with random bug bites on mine and my sons body.
__label__2	"The Philly Burger was great... Too bad I can't say the same for The Watch Party for Game Of Thrones.   The Wi-Fi service was horrible. All the tv's were delayed and few of them froze for a long period of time. Service was very unattentive. The manager seemed overwhelmed and uninterested with the entire experience. This was my 1st time here and my last.             

Game Of Thrones watch Party at my place next week everyone!"
__label__2	"This location is dirty. There was some guy just shuffling around ""cleaning"" but doing a whole lot of nothing. The salsa bar was dirty, the garbage area, the tables and the bathroom. They have dirty rags sitting around in a dirty bin they just keep reusing. So,so gross. How is that clean?"
__label__2	Guys. No. It's a less good Reading Market. Too family/kid friendly. No one is conscientious of anyone else. Way too crowded.  And where can i just get some grilled chicken? Pizza at Ava's is disgusting. And there's a baked goods counter in the back where everyone can just grab cookies with their nasty hands, and no one monitors it. No. No. No.
__label__2	"Never coming back here again. Whatever comments I had to fix my son's hair was not her fault. The lines are uneven but it's not her fault because she's following the hair line. 

I'm giving it a 2 star instead of a 0 because at least the cut was decent. Enough for me to fix with products."
__label__2	This hotel is not bad for the price and location I guess?? However if I were you I would bring my own towels, sheets, pillowcases, shower shoes. The ample amount of hairs from strangers that I found in the first 10 minutes was enough to gross me out enough to not ever recommend this place to anyone.
__label__2	Food wasn't bad but the restaurant was dirty. Steps up hadn't been swept in ages. The buffet was so dark you couldn't see the food. You pay first and I tipped but no server even came by my table. Not a do-over.
__label__2	"The service was good but our dinner was so-so. 
But what really left a bad taste in our mouths was the terrible dessert.  The waitress recommended the bread pudding as being really good. It didn't even look like bread pudding... More like a sundae with whipped cream and a drizzle of chocolate sauce. We didn't even finish it and could hardly wait to get home and eat something to kill the bad taste and memory of such a disappointment. 
Our friends recommended this place but I'm sorry to say, we won't be back."
__label__2	"More than Disappointed by the shrimp PoBoy, 
Dry no taste, the bread was 4 times the size of the shrimp that was in it. The burger that my son had was better. 

I would not try it again since the disappointment of the PoBoy. 

Old and dirty especially the restrooms, nasty!"
__label__2	We ordered the General Tso's chicken and Hunan chicken for our entrées, and both were grossly soggy. However, our crab wontons and egg rolls were pretty good, and the delivery was quicker than the estimated time given, so I'll give two stars instead of just one. We probably won't order from here again, though.
__label__2	Your standard chinese food buffet. Nothing exceptional, except that they have a little more seafood than the rest...not that it's stellar, either, because those big slimy oysters are a little *blech* (stick to the mussels). Some of the items that are usually frozen and thawed by most buffets were a rung higher than the other joints in town, including the dim sum and the stir fried dishes (veggies seems less sodden than comparable buffets). Overall, not bad but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.
__label__2	Great menu, great service and affordable yummy breakfast! I had steak and egg as well as the chorizo with egg, it was awesome! Bottom line would I return ? Yes I would..enough said!
__label__2	Over hyped restaurant.  seems a local is trying to play with the big boys, but it just wasn't happening here.  sorry to say, over priced sub par food
__label__2	. R&R was not as great as everyone says they are. The oxtails lacked flavor. The curry chicken was NOT tender. I wouldn't go back.
__label__2	Nope. So sweet. Why????? Why must you make the pad thai and green curry sweet like candy?!?! Service was fine, a hole in the wall is fine, but no.... Still having a hard time finding a good Thai place....
__label__2	pancakes were garbage. mcdonalds, though fast food, id consider as super light but nudy's is almost chewy and 7x the price. not sure if the pancakes were overcooked but not light at all and almost dry because of it.
__label__2	I like the local mom & pop pet stores better. This one is rather unorganized with not much help from employees.
__label__2	Staff was outright rude. I had a chicken sandwich that included all the stems from the jalapenos. I live in Clearwater and this is my last time there.
__label__2	I just order over $100 worth of food. 5 burritos,  3 bowls, & 4 brownies. When I ordered on line I put names down for each item. After picking up order & getting to work I open the bags. No names on anything. We had to open every burrito and guess which one was who's. Also no chicken in one of the bowl! So aggravating!
__label__2	Nothing special about this place at all. I had the warm pork sandwich and it was so dry I would have sent it back if I hadn't been so hungry. My son's pizza looked ok and my husband and other son both had sandwiches which they said were ok. There were no chips or fries with the sandwiches and the bread was dry. Service was good, the waitress so cheerful I wondered if she was on drugs. Overall very disappointing and I would advise eating elsewhere.
__label__2	First let me say the food is great but their prices are NOT what you expect based off yelp photos of the menu and what is it with RENO Mexican restaurants not putting guacamole on anything and then charging $2 for a teaspoon of guacamole SO DAMN RIDICULOUS I might as well drive to San Diego for regular priced bomb Mexican food that comes with guacamole with these Reno prices
__label__2	Love Chick-fil-A but not this one. The staff was slow. They prefer to socialize among themselves in front of their customers over taking care of their customers.  Only ordered one item because, while waiting in line, it was evident the service would be poor.  Skip this one.
__label__2	What in the Fried Chicken Frenzy was this? Cold, tasteless Fried chicken, Rice, Fries, and stale Biscuits . The chicken was tasteless! Won't ever go back there again...
__label__2	The service department is always slow and it's hard to get an appointment. My car sometimes is there for days on end as parts seem to be hard to get and have to be ordered. I am having to call and get updates as no one calls me. I need a new car as mine is out of warranty but because of my service experience each time I want be investing in a Subaru
__label__2	This place is ok if you don't have a car and live in IV. It's expensive and they seem to mess up my order a lot. I didn't like their chasu and popcorn chicken cause they were way too dry and there's not much toppings in the mala tang noodles either. Only thing I like about this place is the pork belly but it's too pricey.
__label__2	"I love the spot, the food, but not the lines out the door or "" really do not care what you may think"" attitude at this place. It is Sat. morning  and their specialty is as a bakery for gosh sakes. The wait staff were totally without remorse when it turned out  that almost all the baked goods offered  there were gone, totally sold out by 9:30 AM!
Ridiculous  to have so little and they were not even nice about it. Tough luck was the message I got."
__label__2	"Glamorized chicken macnuckets.

The chicken is fresh but that is about all the positive spin I can put on the experience. Breading is neutral, sauce is something you would expect to pour over a garden salad, fries like Del Tacos but not as good.

They try to be trendy with slogans like ""Kiss the Cook"" or having the employees wear tee shirts and jeans. 

Satisfied my curiosity is about all I can say. If you like the original without choices than this place might be for you."
__label__2	The lady felt like she didn't even want me there and the color that I picked didn't look like the one I got. I went with it though thinking it would turn out okay, but she got it all over my skin and I had to file the edges when I got home because they were too thick. The last pic is my nails not even 2 weeks later. I got dip powder (and have for the past year) and they have never peeled or chipped like this before. Never going back here
__label__2	Mediocre sushi and mediocre service. On par for what  you would expect from a sushi restaurant in a strip mall. I won't order from here again.
__label__2	Not sure if they changed cook, our food didn't taste japanese at all. There were melons and mangoes on our seaweed salad and regular salad. It is seriously the weirdest thing I've tasted in a Japanese restaurant. The chirashi bowl shrunk in size and half of my tempura plate was carrots! While the service was amazing, it didn't make up for the food. I wouldn't come back here, it was a major disappointment.
__label__2	Table was not cleaned. The food was cold. Service was okay. Sausage was dried like two days old. I had bad experience and food quality last a few times so time for me to find new breakfast restaurants or at least try at different location besides Bruce B Downs location.
__label__2	No wow factor for me. Got here late Sunday morning and they're out of most of their desirable bakery items.  Would have been more of a wow factor had they been replenishing bakery items that are more desired had I been first in line this morning. For me it's MIs managed for the later crowd that wants Sunday coffee and a nice bakery item on a late weekend morning.
__label__2	Messed up my takeout order. Wanted the eggroll noodle(#22) and side of eggrolls. Ended up with 2 sides of eggrolls. Paid cash and was written correctly on receipt just wasn't communicated correctly between cook and server to pack. And no don't have time to go and drive back. Theres a reason for takeout
__label__2	I really wanted to love this place considering it's on my block and had great reviews, but the portion sizes were laughable. My boyfriend and I shared the vodka rigatoni and the tagliatelle bolognese, which were certainly tasty. The rigatoni dish had twice as much pasta as the tagliatelle... but it was still not enough food for us, even though we indulged in the garlic bread as well. You would think for a $50 meal we wouldn't walk out of there hungrier than we came in. Would not recommend.
__label__2	Rachael was great at the front counter. My Chicago Style Frank was room temperature and there were no napkins in the to-go bag.
__label__2	Portion sizes way too small for the price point. Food is just ok and nothing to rave about. I probably won't be going back because there's nothing compelling me to pay so much money for a dish I can get elsewhere in Tucson for almost half the price.
__label__2	Nothing special. Average. Food is plain and boring. Decent atmosphere. The staff is mostly teenagers. Had a salad and the French onion soup was disgusting. I'm sick to my stomach leaving. Over priced diner food.
__label__2	"Ran in to ask for some ranch or ketchup because I didn't get any from another fast food place, and the boy at the counter 1) pulled his mask down to hear 2) rolled his eyes when I asked if it was free.

I forgot my wallet in the car, I was not homeless. Wouldn't say it's the warmest welcome I've ever gotten. If He hadn't turned around and gossiped to his coworkers about me/my appearance or my asking if it was free, I may have even bought a meal because my meal from earlier was so bad."
__label__2	Not a great experience. Visited 6/21 Fathers' Day. Seated quickly but someone/thing lost our order. Waitress? Cook? Computer? So simple breakfast came about 35m after we were seated. The wall next to us was splattered w/ something. Yuk. Finally and most egregious to me is the throw-away plastic drinking cups. They must chuck hundreds a day, and obviously they have a dishwasher. Server was pleasant, food was hot and tasty.
__label__2	"They really need to put in more food. I got orange chicken& lou mein. They barely gave me any orange chicken; it didn't even cover the bowl of lou mein. For +$7, there really ought to be a bit more food. 
Not worth the money with how much entree they give"
__label__2	worst chicken sandwich i've ever had. it was one of the driest, flavorless chicken sandwiches ever. their char burgers are usually good though.
__label__2	Used to love their $5 burger night. Since they re-did the menu (and made it $6 burger night!), the quality of the food went down.
__label__2	waiters/waitresses are always in a rush and don't really attend you when it's busy, my food wasn't great, i got the chile relleno and a torta. The torta broke apart and there was more vegetables then meat, the chile relleno had way too much cheese and then it was mozzarella cheese, i've never had a chile relleno with that kind of cheese before. Over all disappointing for a mexican restaurant.
__label__2	I want to love this place, but it's hard sometimes. The food is so hit and miss, the same item could be unbearably spicy one day, and horribly bland another day. The service is kind of impatient and rude, and I always feel like I'm imposing on them by patronizing their establishment. Since India Club opened we haven't been back.
__label__2	"Good atmosphere but the food is nothing great. Had the pulled pork but one major thing it's not pulled pork! It's pork cold cuts drowning in barbecue sauce that had way too much black pepper.
Also had the filet sliders that looked like burnt left over trimmings and the crab cake was so so. I wasn't expecting a gourmet meal but really if your menu says pulled pork it shouldn't be cold cuts and if it says filet it should be ( note I do butcher my own meats from time to time)"
__label__2	Service was fantastic but the sushi was not fresh. We couldn't eat more than half of our rolls because the raw fish tasted like it was bad. We had high hopes after hearing great things, but I don't think we will be returning.
__label__2	"The ice cream was ok. Good but not great. If it was a little cheaper I may think Fro-Yo was worth your hard earned calories. My opinion must be wrong since there are alway tons of people eating there. It must be the outside seating or something. 

Unfortunately, I will not go back to Fro-Yo out of principle. I walk in front of the store every morning and 75% there is trash all over the sidewalk. Empty ice cream cups and napkins are everywhere. I call it litter and as a University City local I cannot support an establishment that dirties up my street."
__label__2	The standard McDonalds food, the ice-cream machine was down but at least the food was hot and the staff were really nice to us.
__label__2	"The cost of the food did not match the quality of the food.  I do not mind paying more if the food and experience are worth it, however this place is not one of those places.  The bread on the sandwich had hard edges, like it had been cut earlier in the day and the fries were cold, not cool, but cold.

Unless you are a wine drinker, I would find someplace else to dine."
__label__2	Made reservations in October for Thanksgiving.  Called twice to confirm only to be told that they no record of the reservation.  The day prior I called and I was told that they could not confirm, but could guarantee a seating for two people.  Arrived and was told they were booked.  I even gave my credit card info to hold the reservation.  A real disappointment since this was a gift for two friends.  Very unorganized and sub par.
__label__2	This place lacks variety. If you want variety, this is not the place for you. It is very pricey and they charge you for food you ordered but did not finish. A majority of the staff was helpful and friendly but one employee, a tall Asian man was very rude. When I was ordering, I could tell he did not want to take my order. I was very disappointed after my visit here. Do not plan on coming again.
__label__2	Been here before and it was good. Ordered mussels in red...wow big mistake. It was tiny, cold mussels in a tomato paste. Gave 2 stars because the waitress was very nice. Will never be back.
__label__2	Limited menu, no indoor seating, filthy gross restaurant.  No hard tacos, no chips and guac?? Are you even Mexican bro??
__label__2	I haven't been to this restaurant in years, but it was on my way after an appointment, so I stopped in for a late breakfast. I ordered cafe con leche, Cuban cheese toast, and a side of bacon. The cafe con leche was quite good and so was the bacon, crispy like I asked. The Cuban toast, though, was just so-so. You couldn't taste the cheese in it at all. I looked, and there was hardly any cheese in it. I'm sure some of the other food is good, but this was my experience today.
__label__2	"Chicken parm sub oddly flavorless. But it looked good at least.
Haven't tried the pizza."
__label__2	When I think of Hookah, I think of this place. I've been coming here for awhile throughout the years; but every since numerous hookah spots have started to emerge, I've decided to go elsewhere. The price of their hookah is high compared to others, and it's always CROWDED! The only thing they've got going is the location! This spot def appeals to college kids & ppl who aren't familiar with the city.
__label__2	"I had the turtle cookie -- the one with caramel and chocolate.. I definitely like the concept -- of course, I ordered it -- but it doesn't work for  a cookie -- the entire cookie was a crumbly mess -the caramel was hard as a rock, although the fudge was nice and soft.    I know this is a first world problem, but  step it up... 

I'd also recommend folks avoid the macaroon-- yes it was large so I guess you should love it, but needs more coconut flavor please, not almond."
__label__2	I really wanted to love this place- a 24 hr diner downtown! So well located!- but the whole experience fell flat. Honestly, the food is just not good. My boyfriend and I ordered french toast, a side of bacon, and a cheesesteak sandwich. The items tasted bland and had the consistency of re-heated frozen food. Not good. And the prices are too steep for the quality! Either decide to be a crappy diner with crappy diner prices, or back up your prices with quality food. Our service was good, but we wont be back.
__label__2	Very disappointing and unsatisfactory.  The Chicken Tikka was from a processed chicken ball and dry as a bone, without flavor.  The lamb biryani was not hot and the lamb did not look or taste fresh.  Service was slow
__label__2	Clean, professional, but longest ER wait I've ever experienced. It wasn't packed with patients, but personnel seemed lethargic & more interested in chatting than administerin care.
__label__2	Just called the store. The lady said they're closing in 15 mins, 1pm.  If you close at 1pm then update your hours.  This says 2pm.
__label__2	This by far the DIRTIEST Cracker Barrel I have ever been to. The hostess moved the dirty dishes from one table to another to seat a table at 815pm on a Thursday night.  Server brought the wrong drinks. We are off to a great start #sarcasm.
__label__2	I use to LOVE Tiffin but the quality has definitely gone down over the last few months. The sauces are not the thick, perfectly seasoned sauces you expect from Indian food. They're very watery and bland now. The rice was hard and dry.  I was terribly disappointed in my meal. Not sure if I'll be returning...
__label__2	They say the food is good . We have gone there 2 times and left due to poor service. Last time one other table and waited over 15 min under a noisy air conditioning unit were they seated us. We were going to ask to move but they just forgot about us . Service is very bad!
__label__2	The place is beautiful, music is great and the staff is all polite. It was the food. The prices was a little above average when you order a burger and a side. The ice cream has an after taste that was not pleasurable to the palate. We asked for straws and was told they place was out but many tables had them. I was wanting a chocolate coke but was told they could not do it. They have a cherry chocolate coke both made with syrup. It was a cool experience but will not be going back.
__label__2	Yellow lentil soup was so salty had to throw it out. Coconut soup didn't have a hint of coconut flavor. Coworkers who also ordered said for the price more rice could have come with their meals. We probably won't order again.
__label__2	This place reminds me of the packing district in anaheim. It has a good amount of choices for food but it's over priced and not that great. Well what did I expect when I saw no thai people working in a thai restaurant. I got the tomyum noodles and it was super bland even after i drowned it in sriracha. I JUST WANTED SOME GOOD FOOD DAMMIT. It was really expensive too like wtf. Probably not coming back here like ever. NOPE NOPE NOPE
__label__2	Went here with my husband and 2 kids. Ordered pizza, salad, and pasta to share.  Service and food were average, nothing spectacular for the $$.  Very loud inside and there was some annoying loud music playing and a big screen tv with some 1950's movie with no sound?! Sensory overload pretty much. They should turn the music down or figure out something to improve the poor acoustics. :/
__label__2	I'm not a fan of the new American spin on tandoori. Naan pizza? Grilled naan sandwiches? They forced us to grill the naan sandwich in the sandwich press!!!!? Can't we just get it traditional style? It was just ok. I'll stick with traditional Indian food.
__label__2	I went to McDonald's and the employee didn't say hi she was looking at my eyes and when I got my Big Mac it was all sloppy and had to much salce
__label__2	"1/26/13 - The building is a pile of rubble. Will update if it is rebuilt.

My experiences here have mainly been through the drive thru. The food is always good and the drive thru is usually faster than the one or two times I tried to eat-in. The quality had improved and the drive-thru people were nice.  Hopefully these nice people will be back if it is re-built.

I still hate sea-salt and their new (skin-on) french fries. Because of this I do not frequent Wendy's as much as I used to. Bring back the old fries!"
__label__2	Frustrated....kids working here are VERY laid back ...no sense of professionaism for the job. IDK if family owned...very nice but when you are not being sanitary with your hands and working with product it's a turn off...flavor changes do not seem to rotate that well..
__label__2	"Pizza was good but the staff was very rude to us. They made us feel uncomfortable and it was a really weird situation. I wouldn't recommend coming here and I definitely won't be back. FYI, they have prices listed for whole pies but the staff says ""one slice per person."""
__label__2	The food and wait staff are good. The woman at the front counter is rude. She acts like you are an inconvenience whenever you walk in there. Today when I paid she never even said thank you. Not good to have your front counter person being rude to all of their customers. Not sure I'll go back anytime soon which is a shame because the food is good
__label__2	"Yikes. Food is decent. It's not bad. You might be ok until you consider portion size and price. New Orleans is an expensive city. Good food isn't cheap. I can accept that. After getting crammed into the sardine can of a restaurant- it fell far short of expectations. Won't be a return

Update: food is still far overpriced."
__label__2	"Lousy
Sent back uncooked fish and chips, dry over cooked salmon and dry and tough chili. Mussels fabulous.
They were attentive and acknowledged the problems. Burgers and wings looked good. Stick to real basics, overly ambitious for skill level"
__label__2	Tried Ravello delivery for the first time. After an hour and a half, i called and they forgot my order. Fine, things happen. I asked him to cancel the order and i would go elsewhere, but he said he would credit half the fee if i tried their pizza anyway. 45 minutes later pizza came, but no credit. Pretty shoddy business practice and you lost a customer. For the sake of fairness, the pizza is good
__label__2	Went there in the morning. There is a girl that works there who really has a bad attitude. When our coffee was ready, she didn't say anything, just left it on the counter. Poor service because of her. Again if you don't like your job, what are you doing there?
__label__2	Today visiting with my parents reminiscing about my father n law. I thought I'd order me some what he called Asian Cow (Moo Goo Gai Pan) 2 half orders of shrimp fried rice and plain fried rice which resembled cous cous. They forgot to put my shrimp in the Asian Cow.  I called several times and no answer.  I do not recommend and won't be back!
__label__2	Great decor!  Nice service, but just ok food served in small portions....very over priced! They need to go back to the drawing board with this one.
__label__2	They overpriced me on two mufflers installed on my car. I have a light color interior and the mechanic left oil smudges on my interior door. The tech wasn't very informative about the condition of my car nor did he discuss any future maintenance that I should be consider. Just not as professional as I would hope.
__label__2	Hopefully this was an isolated bad day for them but our experience was really disappointing. Waiters and waitresses were really polite and genuinely cared. Unfortunately a succession of disappointing things happened. One of the plates they brought us was dirty, which would have grossed out many customers. The glass of wine we were given was chipped. Our waitress appropriately apologized. The spaghetti carbonara did not taste like carbonara in our opinion. It tasted more like alfredo. The Brussels sprouts were good in our opinion. The caesar salad was ok. Overall disappointed.
__label__2	Service distant, tip requested before getting food,  and the food ranges between above-average and bland and terribly under seasoned and generic. Very hit and miss. They need to lower prices desperately.
__label__2	Overpriced, and quality has dipped at a rate faster than the US's food production.
__label__2	"Although this location always draws a large crowd, I fail to see the reason why.

Service is a little iffy, but the staff tend to be fairly friendly and conscientious. The bartenders can be abrupt at times (asking for a soda or water can get you a major stink eye on a busy night).

Food here is bland, overlooked, and boring. Very much what you would expect from a bar. Their salads sound good on the menu but are now where near as nice in reality! Fries are usually on the burnt side... Their only saving grace is their nachos."
__label__2	The guys at the desk need PR help. Not friendly. Service not quick, too much fooling around on the computer. They do have a $19 oil change though!
__label__2	"Every time I go in here the bouncer is super weird about my ID. I'm 27 and he always says ""this isn't you"" it's a New York ID so I guess that confuses them. Also I paid 6 dollars for a Miller lite. This bar is trash.. the only reason I gave it an extra star is because it's never crowded and relatively easy to get a drink. But damn, chill. I don't look underage by any means"
__label__2	"The food was ok , but not what i call genuine authentic mexican . The salsa was store bought and so were the chips. the food was very spicey which I like because im from Texas. But what really pissed me off was that I ordered a Coca Cola and they brought me some generic ass sams club cola soda...I asked do you have Pepsi , Dr. Pepper? Nope only generics..

WTF?"
__label__2	Ordered takeout and disappointed. Ordered breakfast quesadilla and received a greasy mess- maybe it's inevitable due to chirizo, but the presentation was awful. Also the home fries are meh- weird seasoning and under salted.
__label__2	Don't recommend to stay in this place. Prices are high for what you are getting. They used the covid time to cut all the amenities. Rooms are far from being  good. Breakfast is subpar, you really have nothing to eat. They closed the office so you have to run across the street to get every thing. No plastic utilities in the room. No drinking water. They are full of promises until  you get there. I wouldn't stay there again.
__label__2	Over priced for undercooked wings. Bartenders and waitresses are super nice. Cooking staff is awful
__label__2	"First time here, service a little slow at the Bar. I ordered the eggs Benny was cooked to perfection. The kitchen was a little slow. The bar tender was very friendly. My husband had the farmer house burger, tasted like a frozen party, the grilles tomato was so thin you didn't even notice it. Red skin potatoes were just fries disappointed. 
My hash browns where good, sounded spicy but where not 
Will give it another try though, maybe an if day"
__label__2	This place is incredibly pricey $14 for a Moscow Mule? Especially one that was very week just tastes like ginger beer it was not enjoyable at all. Our bartender was nice but he kept touching his hair and then proceeded to grab ice with his bare hands and put that in customers glasses (really!) total disappointment especially because we love this hotel!!!
__label__2	"Unfortunately the service here is so bad it takes away from the great location and good food. The bartenders were literally doing shots while allegedly ""working"" - meanwhile neglecting the customers. It's a shame this place is associated by fine restaurants in town such as fish house and boathouse where service is always good. After returning three times hoping to get better service I am giving up on this place- Casa Blanca, please do your customers a favor and hire people who are not drunks and actually want to work. Thank you"
__label__2	Waited for 45 minutes for hotdogs. Obviously not worth it. They should hire staff  so you don't have to be shitfaced to be thisnterrgoen.
__label__2	We booked for a birthday celebration. It was totally enjoyable until we went into the almost empty restaurant. There were eight of us. The service was terrible, slow and the food didn't arrive together. My appetizer was delivered after the meal was delivered. The three fried chicken sandwich's meat was less than 1/4 inch thick, over cooked and very greasy. The wrap inside was tasty but the wrapper was dry and inedible. From ordering to check was over two hours. We will not be returning.
__label__2	Lowe's strives on customer service (That is a real joke) and I had a group of mangers  and cashier standing around in a group talking to each other and no one greeted me or acknowledged me as a customer. I think Lowe's must be a self services company because I had to do everything myself. They should have paid me to do their job at the Hendersonville TN Lowe's.
__label__2	The buffet was a decent size and the food was good, but the place was so dirty and gross. There were food crumbs on the table and old stains on the table cloth. The ceiling was black. This made our meal a bit unappetizing. I won't be going back any time soon.
__label__2	I had Amber come out for a thorough move-in cleaning, but unfortunately I was disappointed with the quality of service I received. She missed several details that were specifically listed in her service description, such as drawers in the kitchen, the top of the refrigerator, inside the oven, etc., and really didn't do a good job on the bathrooms. She also didn't appear to dust anything.  I so wanted to give her a good review but after looking closer at the cleaning level, I just can't.
__label__2	No no and no, easy to make dry chicken and drown in sauce and call it jerk. The bathrooms are disgusting and the Mac and cheese oily and dry which I didn't think was possible.
__label__2	The service SUCKS! Took our order fast, then after 10 minutes the waitress comes back to ask what we ordered again, so she can put in the order. First and last visit.
__label__2	"Mediocre at best

I wish I could say it was good but it really wasn't.  Everything was overly and artificially sweetened way outside of Vietnamese norms. The chicken quality was poor and the vegetables were minimal.   Really a mediocre spot.  

Try the Thai to go place In the same plaza, MUCH BETTER"
__label__2	The food is never consistently the same.  I guess they must be one of the busiest locations in St Louis so beware of a constant crowed and don't except to get the same quality you might get at your usual location. And the Internet connection is useless.
__label__3	I used to love this place, but now I feel like they have mystery meat.  The lighting over the food is bad, so you can't really see if it looks good or not. I got orange glazed chicken and it was really gross. Undercooked and slimy. I didn't see any glaze.  It would be nice to see lean meat there, like an actual chicken breast.
__label__3	The shelves were pretty empty (but it was Friday afternoon) and for a Friday (3/3/17) I didn't see any employees walking around.  They had what I needed, but I just like to walk around and shop (I mean everything is a $1).  Please have Roxanne SPIT THAT GUM out and give her, and Miss Paula, a few customer service classes.
__label__3	Panang Curry was OK, nothing special.  Mild but not entirely flavorful.  Tom Yum soup tasted a little off, and the texture was heavy, more like batter than soup.  Spring rolls were good.
__label__3	"Breakfast entrees here were whatever...my bacon scramble was pretty dry, the house potatoes were bland and super mushy. I didn't really like any of my breakfast. Except for the Vanilla Dipped French Toast.

The Vanilla Dipped French Toast with homemade berry syrup and fresh whipped cream. The bread was more like croissant, fluffy, buttery and warm. The berry syrup was sort of a blackberry-raspberry puree. The fresh whipped cream melted on top of the sweet heap of vanilla croissant berry french toast and each bite melted in the mouth. It was pretty heavenly."
__label__3	Kinda pissed thought I ordered a proper philly cheesesteak since that was the name but it was served with tomatoes and lettuce. And I came to realize after the meal was delivered that this isn't a proper cheesesteak...change the name so tourists don't make the same mistake I did and get the correct one with onions and cheese wiz. It was still good but totally disappointed. Next time I will try another place. Also side note my sandwich was not very warm and when I was half way done it was cold, I thought these were made fresh...
__label__3	I wish i discovered this place years ago.  Will, go back.  First time I had bubble tea..not bad
__label__3	"It was quite a nice boat with tons of room. Almost too much room. It was quite empty during our tour, but the 3 hours by very quickly. Service was top notch. The food was certainly lacking as was the ""band"". Must do in NOLA but once is good enough,"
__label__3	with the growing market I hope they increase their product selection!! only three stars because i've been spoiled shopping at new seasons in portland oregon. staff is friendly and raw juices/smoothies are awesome. only complaint is how small the store is in terms of selection.
__label__3	"$3 for a cupcake? Get out of here. 

I ate the ""cool vanilla bean"" cake because that was my nickname back in the day. It was good. I ate it outside in the sun. Some kid was playing on the sidewalk. Watch out, kid, cars are rolling by! 

The bathroom was so clean that I could've eaten my cupcake in there. I didn't take a shit in it. (The bathroom, not my cupcake.) If I did either, it would've made my day."
__label__3	"1st visit after meaning to try since they opened, so total neophytes.
Had hot dogs and onion rings - both good, but don't get all the hype - solid place for a bite, but nothing to really get jazzed about."
__label__3	Food is pretty unique. Not the typical sandwiches in terms of ingredients used. Mainly different greens which is refreshing. Kale is a big this here and I highly recommend the Kale salad with salmon. Delicious. For drinks, I had the chai tea, it was pretty watery and bland. So, given that being my only experience with the drinks, I cannot speak too much, but will give other drinks a try next time. Overall, food is delicious and will be back for that.
__label__3	"my son loves the wings!  we love that we can split up the wing favors so we can mix it up.  we ordered a chicken sandwich that was a little dry.  we got there early on half price wing night so it didn't start getting crowded till we were leaving.
Our server was great.  kept things coming...checked in with us and even chatted with us."
__label__3	I was eager to try Golden China as there aren't many affordable Chinese takeout places in the area. We ordered won ton soup, an egg roll, a sesame chicken combo platter and mixed vegetables and chicken. The won ton soup was pretty standard, as was the egg roll. The sesame chicken was good, definitely a very generous portion. I found the pork fried rice to be very bland. The chicken and mixed veggies were okay- the sauce they were in was very bland though. I wasn't as impressed as I wanted to be, I'd say this place was just average.
__label__3	This place is very small but each time we go there it's a good time!  Go there!  Good food, inexpensive prices!
__label__3	Hated it when it was a smoking place. Liked it earlier in the year went I went to watch some football one Sunday. I really do not real the food. I think we just had apps and it was your typical deep fried bar fare.
__label__3	One of my childhood libraries. Nice classes here. Living in suburbs wasn't so bad, but once you become a city girl there is no turning back.  Too lonesome and too spread apart as opposed to crowdedness, convenience and proximities of city life.
__label__3	Food used to be so good. I don't know what happened but I haven't been impressed lately. :( the staff are great, just the quality of food has declined in my opinion.
__label__3	The food are expensive for the amount they serve, the Korean beef was delicious. The server was okkkk (wasn't rude). They have parking, that was a plus, but it's hard sometimes to drive out of the place because of traffic.
__label__3	"So the food was spot on. It was tasty and made for 2 meals. 

Service was SLOW. There were 3 tables and 2 wait staff and we waited so long between getting water, ordering, them coming back around. It's like they only came by when we really flagged them down. 

Will order take out from them again but won't sit in the restaurant"
__label__3	"You go to Whole Foods for: cheese, olives, fruits, vegetables, Stoney Field Farms yogurt, ""specialty meats,"" fish, hot/cold buffet, and the sushi.

Save your money and go across the street to Super Fresh to buy everything that you need: toilet paper, canned goods, cleaning products, meats, and so forth.

Whole Foods makes me tired because they don't have anything useful beyond specialty foods.  I shop there first then head over to Super Fresh."
__label__3	I had never been Whale Watching before so I didn't know what all to expect. But my group and I had a great time because we made it a great time. Totally worth it because we got to see not only whales but dolphins, seals and other wildlife. It's a fun boat, much like a fiery. You're not going to find crazy flamboyant captains there to put on a show so don't hold high expectations. Just go with the flow and enjoy the stunning scenery!
__label__3	This is my third time here. My first two dinners were fabulous. Tonight was mediocre at best. We sent the same dish back twice it was over cooked and chewy, my issue is they did not take this item off of my check. Based on this I would not return. The remainder of my dinner tonight was just ok. I was underwhelmed. So bummed about this.
__label__3	Incredible food, incredible style... But the only thing that holds me back from giving this restaurant five stars, is consecutively, three times in a row, I have had the WORST hostess service of any restaurant in Tampa Bay. This restaurant will never go under. It's amazing. But it would really mean a lot if they could just train their front staff a lot better - especially appreciate every patron that walks in their front door by treating them with warmness and respect.
__label__3	Been a few years, but checked them out this week. At 10am on a Thursday there was a line, parking lot full along with the street, and inside slammed. I assume it is the service, friendly, fun top quality personalities. There coffee is better than the last time I went, they still pull their own shots! Good for them! i ordered a dark chocolate mocha with all 4 shots, did not realize dark chocolate could be so sweet, barely tasted the coffee. I tried drinking it, but only drank maybe a quarter of it and it was way too sweet for dark chocolate with 4 shots.
__label__3	Perfect location when you're going to a show at the Ardmore Music Hall.  We went with a slice of cheese and a calzone.  The marinara is quite yummy, and the pizza was standard.  Nothing amazing but you can't beat the convenience for a quick dinner before a concert across the street.
__label__3	First time here, as stated in other reviews the service was non existent. There was only one server for a room full of people. The 3 stars is because the food was good but is very overpriced. $10.25 for the burger and $7.00 for the buffalo blue cheese fries. So with tax and a soda it was $23.00. Also there was a model train rolling around above me that was very loud and annoying. The food was good but not sure I will eat there again at those prices. Oh and everything is charged separately ( no value meals)... Lol
__label__3	Not a big fan, I like other bars much more than this  one. The clientele can be a turn off as well. The layout os unique, but leads to jams and can take forever to get a drink. Bathrooms are on the terrible side of average maintenance.
__label__3	"You can get brake tags here, which is convenient. However, from a convenience store point-of-view, this place is pretty lacking. You can get vitamin water, but that's about it. 

Interestingly, this Shell station has its own festival, I believe it's during Jazz Fest or something. As you might imagine, it's called Shell Fest, and takes place at the gas station. What goes on during Shell Fest, I couldn't tell you. There are usually port-a-potties here during big events (or maybe just Jazz Fest), though."
__label__3	"Good basic Korean.  It takes a lot to get a 4 or 5 from me!

Remember being here two years ago and enjoying the food.

No Frills, when they use real charcoal for you to grill the BBQ Combo of Beef, Pork and Shrimp you know it is authentic.  The family also enjoyed Boolgogi, Kelbi and Squid Saute Lunch Specials.  All recommended, but the squid was a little chewier then my last time here.

Service was efficient and not Unfriendly!"
__label__3	The food was pretty good. The salad bar is a misnomer. It's 1 bowl of salad and the rest is a selection of Mediterranean food (which I really enjoyed). Most of the meat was good although not top quality. I would definitely recommend getting the Caipirinha, their specialty drink. The staff were extremely friendly and fairly attentive. I'm giving my review 3-stars because it is very expensive for the quality of meat that you get.
__label__3	"Have heard great things but wasn't as good as anticipated.  My burger was over cooked, over handled in the making which made the burger chewier than should be.  Wide selection of sauces and burgers but frankly, I think I prefer the flavor and texture of ""steak and shake"""
__label__3	"I chose this place because of difficulty getting appointments elsewhere.  Appointments are easy to get.  However, staff does keep you waiting for an extraordinary amount of time.  Care is good, but staff also attempts to push medications and bloodwork on you.  I suppose they are instructed to ""upsell"".  I don't like that approach at all.  The cost to get a female cat spayed is 600+, which is frankly highway robbery.  My last female cat was spayed at PAWS in Philadelphia for $75, with no upselling...!!!"
__label__3	"I have been to Joann a couple times now and I love that they have everything!  I walked in and said ""wow!""  Although, I do love the store and that they seem to have everything, their customer service is lacking. The store is very busy and the employees are not very helpful and I almost feel like I'm bothering them. Maybe they're not staffed appropriately???"
__label__3	I am not a person that likes to shop a lot but this mall has it all. It is convenient to all bridges and has plenty of parking. Almost any store you might need is located here and I can usually get in and out pretty quickly.
__label__3	Meh.... the service was fast and friendly. The food was good but not great. It was  nice and clean inside. The restrooms could use some work though.
__label__3	It may be that my I'm southern and I've eaten thousands of my mom's top notch biscuits biscuits. These were just okay, not as good as I had hoped. I had chicken as well, the saltiness was Dead Sea level. I felt dry all day after.
__label__3	"We were there over the weekend and carried out.  We don't ever eat tamales from anywhere else in Tucson, but this time they were not as good as usual.  The bean and cheese had very little cheese and the green chili chicken had way  too much masa.  This place is known all over the country and ships everywhere.  Are they getting too big?

We'll try it again, hoping it was just an off day."
__label__3	Love the dollar tree. They have the best holiday decorations. It's not even Halloween yet, and the Christmas decorations are out! Every time that I come to this location, they only have 1 cashier available. It's very inconvenient and the line is always long.
__label__3	"Been awhile since I've eaten here. Used to really like the location on Columbus. This was just mediocre. My ribs were tender, but no sauce, even tho it said sauce in description. (Also pickles in description, which apparently means 2). The cornbread was good, but when I asked for butter, they didn't have any. (What??) 
Not likely ti be back soon."
__label__3	"This place is okay. When I am too lazy to walk to my other Froyo spot (Yogurt City on 13th and Chestnut), this will do just fine. Their flavors are nice, but they don't change them up very often, if at all.

Also, I love my candy toppings, but I hate when they are melted! It is way too hot in there for all of that chocolate to survive, plus I have noticed flies the last few times I have been in there. The place is cute, but needs a little bit of help."
__label__3	Had a delightful meal and a pitcher of margaritas on a beautiful fall day. The service was great...out waiter could not have been kinder! The three amigos enjoyed food, fun and secrets!
__label__3	The theater is really pleasant nice, though the parking validation doesn't always work mean they say 3.00 tho it could be 16.00!
__label__3	"The airport in New Orleans is very easy to get in and out of.   They do have a decent amount of amenities based on the size of the airport.   My one question / Issue is at TSA precheck.  I am not sure why this happens but you still need to take our laptops at this location.   It seems that every other airport that I travel to does not have this policy.   

It's more than an annoyance than anything.   The seating is a little dated"
__label__3	Trey was on time and did a good job with our vehicle.  My initial inspection passed the work, yet after the crew left I had to touch up the rubber trim around the doors (dirty water dripping along body behind door) and there were a couple of product drips/runs on the dash. It was an okay job, but I would have asked for a bit more effort had I done a better job on my initial inspection.
__label__3	"Stayed here for a couple of days while in Philly for the weekend.

Good:
Bed comfortable
Old feel to the building
Link to a great gym and pool (do not miss out.

Bad
Staff do not appear to enjoy themselves nor acknowledge guests.
Photo's make the rooms seem lighter and brighter than they are.
Walls are thin so noise from adjacent rooms transmits easily.

Not one of the better Hyatts I've stayed at"
__label__3	Had a 60 day dry aged strip steak tonight; excellent cut of beef but overcooked; unforgivable.  Sides were ok but nothing special; setting and service were excellent. We enjoyed the bar upstairs before sitting but I'll go elsewhere next trip in to Indy.
__label__3	Liked this place - but did not love it.  Basically doing upscale mexican/spanish food and trying to charge a bit more for it.  Drinks were good, but not cheap at all.  Decor was very nice and again upscale - quite a preppy crowd, casual but a bit stuffy.
__label__3	So, I gotta say I wasn't super impressed. I got the special of the day and was told it would be spicy.  It was mild and had an OK flavor but nearly all of the pork in the dish was just straight up fat.  Not very appetizing.  Kinda ruined it for me, especially since it wasn't necessarily cheap.  I'll give it another chance but you can see in my photos how much just really wasn't worth eating.
__label__3	Friendly and reasonably priced service.  It cost $22 to remove a bolt from my tire and patch it, and it was done quickly.  My only complaint (I guess not really a complaint, but a bit suspect) is they gave me my service review and it said I may need to consider having the tires replaced.  Except this is May and I just had them replaced FROM Bill Estes in November.  So either they gave me crap tires back then or they don't really need replacing now.  Checking into the tires and will update this review.
__label__3	"Upstairs is light & bright.  Nice atmosphere.  Waiter was too ""familiar"".  Blackened chicken sandwich was good but not great.  Fries were cold.  You could certainly do worse in the French  quarter."
__label__3	"I want to be a fan, but they're on and off. When they're on they're really on, and if they're not, well, be prepared to eat burnt stuff. The last time I was over there, they burned the onions on my burger. The fries were still really good and the burger was really wet and drippy. 
For the most part it was  ok."
__label__3	The place was clean and everyone was friendly and professional. That being said, I received the worst beard trim ever. Actually, the only bad trim ever. I know it was just one barber and that doesn't reflect the skill of every barber there, but he should have probably stayed in construction. I wouldn't recommend going if you have a larger beard.
__label__3	Not my favorite IKEA store but I needed a place to kill time before lunch.  Overall I am VERY fond of IKEA stores.  They always have some great gadgets & I try to grab them when I can before they are gone.  Got my fix today & really enjoyed it.
__label__3	This place was pretty good. I went in with a friend after the gym because we wanted to try it, it was local and we were hungry. Maybe its because we were dressed in gym clothes but we felt a little pretentious air from the beginning. The food was good.  We got the mussels, pork belly and another dish that is slipping my mind right now. I would try here again when I am not in a rush so I can enjoy it more and actually try the drinks.
__label__3	Michael's is your typical big box craft store. Make sure if you need to buy a bunch of stuff over a couple of days or weeks that you use a coupon. You can usually get a 40% off or 50% off coupon though its mobile app. I like the scrapbooking section at this store.
__label__3	"Nice little ice cream shop. They have a lot of flavors to pick from. Hard working crew.

The only problem was that the ice cream was way too soft and was dripping off the cone almost immediately."
__label__3	Family meet up in Indianapolis for the day. Kids were playing Pokeman Go around the city, and we were checking out all the local sites. It was luch time, looking for an inexpensive family friendly place to please both kids and grandma alike. Yelped and found Punch Burger. We were sold on the place when we read they use locally raised grass fed beef with not antibiotics or hormones.
__label__3	Always has one thing that is missing when going to get supplies.   Still keep going back!   Large variety of clothing and shoes.   A good place to start to load up on fishing supplies and camping gear.
__label__3	I normally love hattricks but had a bad experience recently. I went in and the service was slow, they then said my REAL ID was fake and took it. I then had to call the police and get my ID back. The owner did not even apologize. Great food though.
__label__3	Came here for matcha latte and a normal latte. The normal latte was great, what you would expect from a specialty coffee shop. The matcha latte was not good at all. It tasted like water with a couple scoops of matcha thrown in. The drink was over 6 dollars for pure mediocre product so if you come here, do not come here for this drink.
__label__3	The service here is terrible. Takes forever to get a drink. The one dude bartender takes his time with everything while the woman works her butt off. Nonetheless on Tursday there are $2 tacos in the bar area all night. The food is great and it never takes long after you put in your order to get your food. Has good happy hour specials.
__label__3	It's a solid grocery store.  I find it a little pricey but if you shop sale it evens out, so just shop smart.  They have better than average produce. I also find it a little annoying you have to put in your card first at check out to get the specials.  Convenient location with a crazy parking lot.
__label__3	It's a bar with bar food. Fries were good, basic bar type stuff. The service is way to slow...just opened, so maybe they'll work it out but so so slow
__label__3	First time I went here the BBQ ribs were awesome. Second time, they were over cooked so bad that half weren't edible. Ill give it another chance but 25 bucks for a slab of ribs.... Geesh!
__label__3	The service was excellent.How ever the food was not. I had Alaska salmon sandwich could hardly see any salmon. And the pickle veg. Was not good.
__label__3	"It was ok.  I think I ordered the wrong thing... didn't care for their version of Italian sausage at all.  Consistency was too soft and weird to enjoy eating...

I'd like to go back and try one of their specialties sometime.  We were eating with a group that couldn't decide on anything though."
__label__3	Came here for the Pork Tenderloins. They were great. The rest of the menu was nothing speical, but all the food on the table was decent bar food. The bar had a good neighborhood and family feel. Our drinks were never empty, and the service was friendly.
__label__3	Ehhh im in between about this location. Fast service but the staff is not always so friendly but again.... I come here because of location convenience.
__label__3	Ralph's had great service but it is not a place to go out to eat at if your hungry. I enjoyed it but my wife didn't so much. We went for one of our Anniversaries.
__label__3	Good food over all. Had 2 apps instead of a main. Had alligator bites. Excellent! The sauce was a bit blasé. Basically a spicy dijon mustard seed aoli.   Also had shrimp and corn bisque. No shrimp a few pieces of corn and lots of heat. Typical new orleans...  Make it spicy and folks wont notice the lack of taste or ingredients
__label__3	I had high expectations from all the positive reviews, but the not-so-friendly attitude I got from the guy behind the counter along with the unwelcoming environment was enough to really make me think again before coming back. I ended up getting the Rachel and it was good, but not mind blowing in my opinion.
__label__3	I give this place a 3.5 star - this may change as I try more dishes, but I liked how you just order at the counter and they bring you your food right away. I order the kimchee bokum bap, and it was great - looked just like it did in the picture! (That was my first thought). The place is clearly meant to be there for college students - great idea. Quick, pretty-good, Korean food. I'll be back there again.
__label__3	You know what you're getting when you go there. The Hermitage doesn't pretend to be anything at all...it is what it is.  A Late Eats Greasy Spoon, heavy on the grease.  The fried potatoes are so good...nice and crispy...yum!  Good breakfast, colorful clientele and pretty darn good for people watching.
__label__3	First time here today. It's a very small, basic deli. It reminded me of a Primos hoagie place. The hoagies tasted good and were made with Dietz and Watson deli meats. I did notice that they sliced the cheese with the same slicer as the meats, which concerns me since I am a vegetarian and only want cheese hoagies and not any kind of meat remnants mixed in. I also requested banana peppers on the side which I never got. They were really busy when I went so maybe that is why.
__label__3	Not bad at all. I would come here again for the pizza. Not many other choices for good pizza in Tucson, especially on the eastside. Old Chicagos on Campbell is my favorite, but it is expensive and on the other side of town. The service was great. They are really trying to keep and gather customers. The only reason I didn't give it four stars is because the ambiance could be improved on. Kind of drab inside.
__label__3	Not bad. I got the dry rub ribs with green beans and buffalo chicken wings. The food in general was pretty average, but the hot sauce is amazing. Not overwhelmingly spicy, but it has a great flavor. It made the meal. Not a great selection of beers on tap for my taste.
__label__3	"First place we stopped at to eat when we arrived in reno.

the beers looked very interesting, and they were HUGE. 
i forgot which flavors we had but they tasted like blue moons but with different hints of fruits or something

i ordered the pulled pork burger i think, and it was tasty enough. but my bf ordered the steak sandwich and it was not cooked right at all, so he had a tummy ache for awhile. (i think i did too, from just taking a bite)

service was good to us, and i enjoyed the atmosphere."
__label__3	"I mean its a Sonoran Dog...you couldn't ask for much more considering the price, but I would pay a couple bucks more for some better quality ingredients - especially the hot dog and bun.  
The atmosphere is great for what it is. It was super clean and I think they could literally hose the entire dining room down each night.
Clean and Comfortable
Food Alright"
__label__3	Rooftop dining is pleasant. Appetizers and trout delicious. Crêpes Suzette for dessert was a big disappointment. Not authentic and no taste of orange liqueur
__label__3	"Al pastor was good , get your taco fix here , the burritos are huge so can share that as a meal for two

There is out door seating as well but it's is close to the street if you are ok with that"
__label__3	Five dollars for a Miller Lite.....really? I like Bahama Breeze but not that much. I'm out
__label__3	I heard so much about this place that it didn't meet expectations. We ordered all the different oysters but was disappointed in the fresh oysters. They had a slimy texture that was not because they were raw. Nothing I've had before. The only dish I really liked was the soft shell crab platter. Didn't live up to its hype.
__label__3	I ordered the baked salmon and it was good but a bit dry. I didn't enjoy it as much as I enjoyed my friend's food. They all tried my salmon and thought the same - too dry and bland. The place was nice tho, it's huge, clean and with a vibrant environment. A bit pricey in my opinion. The place itself It's worth visiting , but the food is ok, nothing great.
__label__3	"It was a bit too hot to cook dinner so we stopped in for a sandwich. 
First time for us, do we took some time to decide.
My guy went with the Wreck because it has loads of what he loves best. I chose the Veg sandwich with balsamic vinegarette on the side.
I was surprised to see they toast the bread. I like that .
We ate them at home and enjoyed them. 
Next time I'll try that veg sandwich with mushrooms ( they were all out this evening).
I think we'll be back again."
__label__3	Good coffee but disappointing crepes, they are pre made and served cold. $10 for a flavorless chewy cold skimpy crepe with a table spoon of goat cheese, some arugula leaves and balsamic vinegar dressing is quite expensive. Omelettes and hash potatoes are made on site, but there are other places nearby that serve the same fare. There are few pastries and they are left drying out over a counter. It would have been nice if they had excelled in bringing an actual french patisserie to the neighborhood.
__label__3	"We loved Richard at the bar! Such a great night!

However, he made it very clear he does not care about his review. When I said I gave him a good review he said ""oh I don't give a fuck about yelp""."
__label__3	Wings are the best! But service is poor. Always sitting waiting for check or waiting on more water, however food does get out fast. Would come back
__label__3	Clean, but sells no alcohol... I cant get a beer on after class?! tsk tsk I thought this was college
__label__3	Too much on the Salad wedge but the Club sand.was pretty good. Pork Sando next time. Pulled pork pretty good says g/f
__label__3	Mainly a shop for cakes. Not small pastries. The cream filled donut did not taste as good as it looked. $1 for donut
__label__3	For the most part some of the sales mgrs and reps located at the Bala Cynwyd store are nice but there are sales associates employed here who truly show lack of professionalism, interest in their jobs as well as helping their customers. They fail to realize that without customers there is no store which equals no jobs. I go to the King of Prussia store and the customer service is much better than Bala Cynwyd
__label__3	Came here yesterday to try it out. Arrived around 5 and got a table pretty quick. Our server was very pleasant and friendly. She got our drinks quick. The food, however, took a while to get. We came with small children so we can't really have a long stay. To our luck, the only orders they messed up were the kids'. They did try to fix the errors though. I had the buffalo chicken nachos and they did not look like the picture in the menu. Didn't really like them that much.
__label__3	"While Xochitl has some good menu items, notably a phenomenal guacamole, I feel the prices are a little high and the portion sizes are  a tad small.  

With this said I can only give 3 stars. Xochitl is a solid Mexican food spot, I'm just not sure it's worth the price of admission.."
__label__3	Heard great things about this place so I decided to give it a try. I usually go to Eli's or Smokehouse. I got the two meat meal so I could try two different things with tots and beans. The beans were awesome! Everything else was average and expensive. I'll eat there again but I won't go out of my way to get there.
__label__3	I lived here for a year can't say it's been great but it hasn't been completely terrible. They are a nice staff but kind of noisy. And the parking garage situation is what is the worst thing. Very unorganized and paying a pretty penny for service and can't even get a parking spot available! The building is older but the view on the rooftop is the best thing and the pool is fun and clean. It's ok but I've seen better apartments!
__label__3	"Stopped by this shop this morning to get some work done before heading to a meeting. The shop space was unique and appealing with bolted in tables. I was disappointed that the space had no where to charge my computer, so I had to leave and go to another working area. 

I ordered an espresso and it was only ok. 
 
There are many other shops in Nashville I would suggest before Crema!"
__label__3	The food is great! However, every time myself or my coworker have ordered from here parts of the order are missing or we get the wrong things.
__label__3	Got two slices before heading to work. Not sure about the prices because I didn't pay for it (I love my friends!). The pizza was OK, a bit cold for coming RIGHT out of the oven. Felt like an oven while waiting inside too =\ Three stars because ricotta and tomato white pizza is awesome!
__label__3	"Wayyyyy overpriced! Just ONE example- K9 vaccine is $50 for the first and another for the booster (which you need both of). Other vets are $20 per vaccine. 
Everything I've had done there is 2-3x more expensive. 
The front office staff is super unprofessional. 
On the plus side- the Vets and vet techs have always been good. Needless to say We will not be going back to Treasure Valley Vet Hospital."
__label__3	It is now Pro Nails. Dropped by with out appointment early Monday for pedicure. Holly did it but was hard to understand. She was continually trying to add to my order. Sign said pedicure and paraffin 20$. When I was done it was 50$. If I go back I will be sure to clearly understand her.
__label__3	Good oysters on the half shell. Bad seating control. There were open seats inside that they were not using -  just letting people stand around and wait. The inside of the restaurant smelled like a dive bar. We ended up just ordering at the to go window on the side of the place and eating at a picnic table on the pier. People were leaving that were on the wait list because it took too long to get seated. The people managing the seating list were not very helpful and had an attitude.
__label__3	We waited for almost an hour even after making a reservation. The food was good but nothing too special and I felt that they had limited items on the menu. Once we got seated, the serves were very friendly and everything went fine. Just had a bad experience from waiting so long.
__label__3	We came here for the cupcakes. My boyfriend and I are cupcake lovers and determined to find the best in the city. These cupcakes were unfortunately just ok. They were too cold out of the fridge and the ones we let come to room temp, were just ok, nothing to write home about. Pretty tasty cupcakes and sweet box bakery and still our front runners out of about 15 venues.
__label__3	Ive been here twice but dont think Ill return.  The best thing here is the cheese/fruit plate and the st. jaques scallops wrapped in bacon. Ive eaten in over a dozen restaurants in France and have a pretty good idea of authentic FRENCH food - the food at Zinc is not it. Dinner for 2 is about $100 (inc wine, appetizer, meal and dessert).
__label__3	Good spot for late night munchies. Got the beef rolled tacos and carne asada nachos sans guacamole. Close to what I'm used to at Adalbertos but closer than Sacramento. Carne asada had nice flavor and was tender. I would definitely order again. Another plus is that Dutch Bros is right next door!
__label__3	Mediocre Italianish food. Mediocre and forgetful waitress. We were not offered bread though we could see a few tables had it. Overall not an inspiring meal
__label__3	"Stopped by for brunch. Great location right on Jackson Square. Was crowded but we waited about 10 minutes for a table. Everything is ok - nothing really stood out. Tip: get the large Bloody Mary as the regular is half the size. Downside is they don't have decent coffee.

I don't get the 5* reviews. Maybe because I'm spoiled because I'm in NYC? Stanley's is simply a good breakfast/brunch place, but no real wow factor. I'm not in a hurry to go back."
__label__3	"It was good but not great and I was hoping for great.  But I still recommend you try it.  Everyone has different taste buds and the brisket just wasn't what I was hoping for.  Try it and see if you like it.  

Service was good.  Price was very good.  Quantity was good."
__label__3	"Lily's is a favorite dinner spot among my in-laws so I am here regularly. However, I am not that impressed with their food. It's not bad, it's just not that exciting. Some highlights:
- salsa bar for choice of salsas with your chips. I do a mix of the 2 smoked salsas
- high quality margaritas
- they make EVERY order fresh so nothing is sitting under a warmer.

The owners take your order, serve your food. They are very sweet and personable."
__label__3	Extremely slow service when there were only a few tables with customers. Took way too long to get Boston Iced Tea it comes from the bar and there was no one tending it. Food was Ok typical Red Lobster. Cheddar Bay Biscuts were slightly over cooked and dry. Had we not been on this side of town for something else we wouldn't have been here.
__label__3	Pretty for the good food! Server was clearly upset with me because I asked for my pita to be remade after I asked for no onions.
__label__3	"I felt like since this was located in the Mecca of foodie places in Philly, the Reading Terminal Market, this place should have stepped up its game a bit. As it was, it was okay but not outstanding. My chicken sandwich was standard but not stellar, and fries fell flat. Our waitress was distracted so it was hard to wrangle her. 

Overall, I'd look elsewhere in the market for a dining option. While this was fine, you could surely do better with all the tantalizing food choices that abound."
__label__3	"I have gone to this place since I was a little girl and this place has changed throughout the years. The prices have gotten higher and the food quality hasn't changed, if anything, they have lowered their food quality. 

It's a nice place for a quick run for brunch or lunch. The shop is pretty clean. If you go, I would recommend getting the banh uot cha lau or their viet hoagies. They also have a deal that if you buy five hoagies, you get one free so that's a plus. They also have coffee jelly for their drink options!"
__label__3	The food was good bit overpriced. Had to pay for cheese for the tacos which is ridiculous.
__label__3	"I agree with Alice L.  (Though historically I have alsways enjoyed sampling the Violet and Rose flavors.)  The store is VERY old and has been a New Hope institution for years.  It COULD use a clean up.

I do enjoy the ice cream here - but willl not go during peak tourist season as I will NOT wait in a line for it.

The owner is a character - that said I have never had any bad experiences here.  Only tasy ice cream!"
__label__3	"Ordered the Club on wheat instead of a croissant on Friday night. Wish they would have asked me if I wanted mustard... the sandwich was dry and hard to swallow. The ingredients seemed fresh, but somehow, something got messed up.

The upside is that the sandwich comes with a chocolate chip cookie. Mmm... haven't had a good cookie since Uncle Biff's in San Diego!"
__label__3	Ordered take out. A fish and chicken combo. The chicken combo was great. The fish was not. Will not order the fish again.  It came with a salad and fries. There were not any sauces with this dish. The fish combo cost $21 and the chicken was $16. Way more food came with the chicken. Both were a dry. I think my problem maybe been not eating it fresh at the resturant. If I go again it will be to dine in.
__label__3	I had John's for the first time today (but my 100,000 pork sandwich).  It was good, but not my favorite.  Roast pork needs broccoli rabe, it's just a known fact.  The spinach they have to replace it is also, sadly, lackluster.  Seems like it might be canned and there is no salt of flavor.  Not bad, not the best in Philly.  Face it there are just too many great places to consider this special.
__label__3	Been to two other Cajun kitchens that I've loved. The food at the Goleta spot is way greasier. I've had the egg sandwich, chillaquilles, and a breakfast burrito. Basically just balls of grease. Service is great LOL
__label__3	Demos is not really a true Italian restaurant, but is more like an Italianish family restaurant.  I've been a fan of their spaghetti sampler, since it's a way to try old favorites along with something new and different.  But last night, I was kind of disappointed in my sampler.  The Italian sausage was very good, and the Greek chicken spaghetti was very interesting.  However, my brown butter spaghetti was buried under the red-sauce spaghetti sauces.  It's a subtle sauce to start with, but it just disappeared at the bottom of the pile.
__label__3	Kind of bummer. Got a shack double burger with sliced onion and house sauce...it was extremely greasy. Wasn't able to control the sandwich, everything kept sliding out. And it made the bread soggy. The roll is also too small for the large patties. Taste was good, middle was a bit too pink.
__label__3	I've found some really cool stuff here - furniture as well as clothing and linens. The prices tend to be a bit higher than they should be, but it's definitely worth checking out since there are usually some treasures tucked away!
__label__3	Really wanted to like this place, since I moved to Dunedin, but I was let down.. the brisket was dry, the pulled pork was mediocre, the Gouda Mac n cheese was just okay, the servings of meat were tiny. Maybe I'm spoiled but I visit bbq joints for brisket, and they just didn't deliver. Also, this is the only place where I've had BAD onion rings. How is that even possible?
__label__3	"(3.5) ~ good overall food & service

MEAL:
* Santa Barbara Char Burger = (3.75) Good.  It's a Double Char w. Cheese & Avocado, on grilled Sourdough Bread.
* Coffee Malt = (3.5) good, but wanted more Malt;)
* French Fries = (3.25) pretty good"
__label__3	Great outdoor seating, though chilly today. Corn and shrimp chowder was very good. Shrimp and clam just ok, a little greasy.
__label__3	"Steak bites were good. Ceviche was too fishy for our liking. For a Happy Hour, we felt it was a bit pricy. Service was great. 
Adam the bartender was AWESOME!!!! We would come back here just to see him again. And at least we know what Not to order next time."
__label__3	Scaled back menu...and portions. We have a family of five and we're not big eaters, but first time we've left with no take home boxes in a year or more of eating out weekly. Overall food was hot and appetizing. Service  was painfully slow however, as it took 30 min plus to get our order. Three hosts/hostesses just standing idle which was puzzling. I'd say there is much better value (and service) locally, I'd probably skip this place.  Just my 2 cents, your experience may differ.
__label__3	usually a good place to go have been here before and our server was very pleaseant
__label__3	"Reasonable portions for a higher than expected price.

Chicken verde enchilada
Expected a massive plate piled with refried beans and rice but was pleasantly surprises at the very reasonable portion. I don't need all those fillers.

The dining room was nothing special, the service fine and the food ok. This is a solid 3 and good place to swing in and take a load off."
__label__3	"Slices: Edible. Assuming you've been drinking and you need dough and cheese. Not terrible, but I'd not make it a destination. 

Plus, no air conditioning, and and interior decor that reads 'left over from the previous tenant'

Really, 2.5 stars - but I'm not gonna hit them with 2, so I'll round up."
__label__3	Not bad, but I expected better for all the hype. No wonder their Zagat rating has dropped slightly in recent years. Pancetta pasta was very good, but very simple. Risotto had too much cream causing my g/f to get sick. (Risotto across the street at Opal is slightly lighter, and has much more good stuff in it). Service was ok, but a little stuffy. Don't expect a quiet dinner--tables are crammed together.
__label__3	I had a dessert crepe... apple, honey, and walnuts I believe. It was cool, I would've liked it more if the apples were sliced thinner and EVEN MORE if they were baked or stewed. A chutney steak crepe would be off the meter. Anyway, I always thought these guys were rude. Eh whatever, I went just that one time.
__label__3	Coffee was great! Had a cappuccino and the froth was perfect. However, we went for breakfast and there were only three or four options. So, for the limited menu I give it 3 stars.
__label__3	Food is only ok. I'm never too impressed. Service was amazing and I seen a manager going over cleaning duties..making sure everything is super clean so that's a plus.
__label__3	Got the milky way martini and it was really good. Also got the ny strip medium and it was really good also. Inside is really nice. I'LL BE BACK
__label__3	Good hangout spot with friends over bubble tea!  It is slightly more pricey for the typical kinds of drinks, but they have a good variety to choice from.  They also have macaroons and other desserts,  along with snacks now,  if you're hungry while doing work or craving sweets
__label__3	Had to wait a long time to get the bartenders attention for a drink in the lobby lounge.  Was I invisible?  Waited on others who came to the bar behind me.
__label__3	"Tried a Classic with lox slices on an Everything bagel.

- The ""Everything"" bagel seemed to have poppy seeds & sesame seeds, but no onion. 
- Bagel texture was fine, nice crusty exterior.
- The lox was okay.
- Tomato and onion was quite bland

Food seems overpriced.

It's a nice little shop, comfortably decorated."
__label__3	I went to Piccadilly's for lunch and had an OK meal. I had their smoked chicken salad sandwich. It was OK. I felt it was a little overpriced at $8 bucks. The service was good. I don't have much more to say.
__label__3	Huevos Rancheros needs work: super soggy and not very flavorful. However, eggs Benedict is great and so is the Sweet Potato Chorizo. I think it's a great spot and they always have interesting specials so if they mastered their Huevos Rancheros and made sure everything was hot when it was served, I'd be more willing to give them another star.
__label__3	Good food that used to be better.. CF Steak was good. Three items were undercooked: eggs (medium is runny whites), hash browns (crispy is steamed) and cinn. roll was doughy.
__label__3	The most bar like of the three Clear Sky restaurants.  It has a similar wide ranging menu to Clear Sky Cafe with some good and not so good entrees.  When we went the pot stickers were excellent, while the pasta was overcooked.  It is energetic and a good place to meet friends, but the parking lot is small.
__label__3	"Excellent hospitality, sells dim sum all day long which is a huge plus.

However, coming from West Coast, I thought the dim sum wasn't as to die for as others mentioned.

Dim sum were okay, not sure if they used MSG or not but it was not as  flavorful as I had it elsewhere but this was the only dim sum restaurant that I have sampled in Philly so I am not sure where the average falls within the city. However, there are better options out there in NYC/SF/LA area.

Get the steamed dumplings as these are less greasier than others."
__label__3	"I've heard a LOT of complaints about the service, but they were great to me.

The chargrilled Oysters were yummy like everyone said, but I was not as excited about the chargrilled lobster.  They charred my lobster to the point of rubber-esque type quality.  Tip...if you ask for the lobster, tell them to give you the chargrilled oyster sauce.  That stuff is delicious and better than the fake, unsalted butter oil they give you with the lobster."
__label__3	Not a bad place. They offer a free shuttle to and from the Cardinals games, which is awesome. The drink prices are decent and the service is not terrible. Not too many craft beers. All in all, I didn't spend enough time here to give a fair review. I'll have to come back.
__label__3	, Fast service. Friendly staff. Good band. Right on main strip down town Nashville. Very good food
__label__3	Good sandwiches and nice every time we go in. Not amazing have to go back sandwiches but consistently good.
__label__3	When you walk in, it's very dark. It can be seen as a romantic setting. Great service, our food was okay. If you love European food, I'm sure you would love it. It was a great experience for us, but it won't be one of our favorites.
__label__3	"I was pleasantly surprised by the ribs and bbq chicken. They were very tasty and we would definitely order from here again as it is around the corner from our place. The sides however are a no-go, they lack some serious flavor. We could've skipped the Mac and cheese, fries and toast. 

I also didn't love how you have to flag someone down several times to pick up your order and the stares I received when I walked in. Overall in a pinch I would grab the ribs and chicken from here again."
__label__3	Who made this a one dollar sign bakery? Seven dollars for a breakfast sandwich? (Picture of menu is outdated. They charge $6.90 now.) I've had the best breakfast sandwich in town for five bucks. This place is too overpriced for things that you can find everywhere else.
__label__3	"The service was excellent! The menu was OK, not as good as ruby slipper's. 

If you do not like cantaloupe do not order the fruit cup as a side. Because it's 98% cantaloupe. The server can only do so much when the kitchen is overwhelmed. Could not handle special request of egg whites instead of regular. Had to remake and waited twice as long.  They tried, but we just did not have a very good experience. 

First time here, will not return."
__label__3	Food is okay service i think was a little better then the food lol. My friend is close with the owner and i guess they are trying to make monday nights special for bikers so we can get a certain food menu with discounts not bad. I got a chicken platter with rice and beans. Honestly all i can say for now is I have to go to this place one more time to really be able to put up a good review on it. Plantains were really good!
__label__3	While I love that they are organic I can't say they are amazing. They are simply ok. I love the atmosphere and the owners and folks that work there are fantastic. But I just can't get past the texture if their cupcakes. Dense and heavy. But it probably helps to hold the insane amount of icing topped on them.
__label__3	Not too many places to eat in the area, and when there is, it's Korean inspired? Sure, I'll come in. I love Korean food. Lots of options, from sandwiches to wraps, noodles to dumplings, they've got burgers, too. I felt kind of lost looking through their menu, decisions decisions.
__label__3	As much as I love Wawa, I gotta take 2 stars off. It's almost always understaffed and doesn't always have what I'm looking for. Other than that, we're in business.
__label__3	The food is ok, but the environment is very cool. The waiter is very careful, and they are very kind
__label__3	Food was good...just very disappointed with the small portions...especially after we read other reviews.  Will try again though
__label__3	Food was honestly alright, the cookie sundae was amazing though. Service was good, the host Tommy was very nice and he did a really nice job. Me and my girlfriend realized that majority of the house sides that come with the meal 3/5 were potatoes. The other 2 options were Coleslaw and beans I personally dont like either. So i was stuck picking 2 potato items. Something like rice would be nice.
__label__3	Oh, Byblos. Somehow I keep winding up there, even though I'm not that huge a fan. Pretty much every night of the week from Wednesday on is super crowded, so that's a good sign. They play a lot of house and Middle Eastern music, which is nice. The hookah is usually good, although on certain nights (and depending on how drunk they think you are), extra charges have been known to appear magically on the bill. I never really get drinks there, as I'm usually done with the boozing by the time we head over to Byblos.
__label__3	The food was delicious and I am glad that I signed up for door dash so I could get this delivered to my airport hotel. The reason I gave it 3 stars is because the food was delivered in styrofoam. I know this is the take-out container of choice in much of America and that I live in a bubble (Berkeley, CA).... but it is ridiculous that styrofoam has not been banned across the United States. Please do something for our environment and use compostable take-out containers!!  I will happily pay a slight surcharge for this.
__label__3	I tried the Pad Thai dish once for take out.  Unresponsive service as I waited 40 mins.  Big loads of noodles but no FLAVOR, greasy and ultimately disappointing.  I like the interior.  I have to try some of the other dishes.  I'm willing to go back.
__label__3	"Agree with other yelpers...not sure what this place is trying to go for...

Trendy sushi place with a bar that serve bubble tea???

I ordered there special rolls...they were good size portion...fish was fresh...(shrimp inside my caterpillar roll was not really cooked all the way - it was still clearish, asked the waitress...she said it's served like that)"
__label__3	An establishment, historically significant, and great experience - but if you have limited time and want more of a night-out experience listening to jazz, go to Frenchman Street. This is a sit down (or standing room only if you're late in line) place. There is no bar or restroom so you'll have to take care of those needs at the bar next door. I would still recommend a stop here if you have more than 2 nights in town.
__label__3	Food was good , and pretty inexpensive for the portions you get. People were a little rude but that is mostly due to language barriers... I hope..
__label__3	"I will say everything is fresh. Made to order. I ordered a juice and flat bread and it was $20. The flat bread became soggy because they layered it in my to-go box. The juice I ordered was ""healing"". It was tasty, but 75% ice! So for $8 I got a cup of crushed ice with a sip of juice."
__label__3	Wasn't expecting Sushi here so far from the ocean. Not bad at all, but over priced. Save your Sushi craving for a better place if you can. In my defense I was in Sushi withdrawal.
__label__3	"Great place for American Chinese. Everything is quite mild if that what you like. My recent meal is not as good as past. The paper-wrapped chicken app was tough but tasty, won't order again. The fried shrimp app was very good, tender and flavorful. The wonton soup broth was good but the dumplings were soggy and pastey. Just a bad day, will try again. 
Also ordered the Chow Fun with Chicken. Took a bite and was so bland I just chose to leave it for leftovers. Everything is adequate or good, just not great."
__label__3	Crabmeat cheesecake reminded me of a quiche ... It was definitely different . if you're looking for something sweet I would not suggest this cheese cake
__label__3	The server was really nice but I was disappointed in my food quality. The appetizer combo we ordered came out after everyone was finished with their salads and not soon before our meal. The presentation was very poor. The potato skins were super thin and low quality. They had been reheated so long that all of the cheese was melted off onto the plate instead of nicely presented on the potatoes. I ordered steamed vegetables with my meal and they were still raw vegetables. I guess you get what you pay for since the meals are relatively inexpensive. I just was not impressed with the taste or presentation of my food whatsoever.
__label__3	"Other reviewers say it's a tourist trap and I am a tourist, but this place seemed ok. It was clean, the music was live (although all covers) and the waitress was very friendly and kept the drinks coming. As a tourist, I didn't park my bottom here all night. Probably a good idea to hit The Stage for what I'm guessing is a more ""authentic"" experience. Although all of Broadway seems to be people dressing up like cowgirls and Cowboys...so..."
__label__3	"The French Market Inn is super cute, and really close to many things in NOLA! It's reasonably priced, and not so close to everything that it's too loud. Bourbon Street and Jackson Square, as well as the ever popular Cafe Du Monde, is all just a short walk away. Many gift and souvenir shops close by as well. 

As much as I did like the location and look of this hotel, there was a bit of a ant problem. And our final night, there was a cockroach in the bathroom."
__label__3	An okay location for a quick run to the store for a last minute item, overall this is one of the worst Krogers out there. Lacks ethnic food options and this is bad for business.
__label__3	Very good food.  For some reason Creole food is expensive.  We weren't rich and Creole  cuisine was a staple in my home.  For the holidays we ate Gumbo instead of traditional Turkey, ham etc.  The prices here are the same as anywhere else.  The difference is the homey feel and great service.  The neighborhood isn't so nice but once inside the place is very nice.
__label__3	Some of the nicest staff I've encountered in Philly. So helpful, knowledgable and pleasant. Food was good if a little unmemorable. Reasonable prices. Love that it's BYOB. Now if only they'd seal that air vent that caused near hypothermia my entire dinner...
__label__3	Unfortunately had to wait 50 minutes to get our food. Manager took care of the bill which was the correct thing to do and handled it professionally. Food overall was good. Waitstaff seemed a little overwhelmed.....maybe just an off day.
__label__3	I love the way they crank the AC so you feel like you're in a meat locker. the food is mediocre and the mixed drinks are weak, but it *is* margaritaville, so hey...
__label__3	"The wait to be seated was pretty quick but it was also a Friday morning. You basically just tell the host the number in your party, which I can see getting a little confusing to see who came in first since you are not giving a name.

The food was pretty good, our only complaint was the hash browns weren't what we were expecting and didn't really enjoy the flavor. The caramel bombon latte was my highlight, definitely recommend!

Keep in mind that it is cash only, but they have an ATM at the front of the restaurant (requires a fee)."
__label__3	The ambience is great. We sat outside on the patio and it was a beautiful evening. The wine selection is great and there are plenty of options. With that being said though, tapas are very small. Even just for two people, we left hungry and spent around $85. PLEASE TRY THE TRES LECHES! You will not regret it!
__label__3	Kind of overpriced and there was nothing that really took my breath away.  Ended up getting a dress for $30 because I needed to wear something that night.  The consignment stores in my area have way better deals.
__label__3	Can't say I was a fan. I goT sushi and habachi. The sushi was good and tasted fresh. The habachi lacked flavor and the quality chicken and steak wasn't great. The prices are reasonable and service was fast.
__label__3	"This place id definately not what is used to be. Of the 4 meals i had in New Orleans this was my least favorite. I thought the sauces were too thick and gooy. Service was just ""OK"". I used to loev this place but for me Cochon and August blow it away."
__label__3	Very nice office, but didn't get past the waiting room since my insurance was playing games and they asked for $250 for the visit. Immediately walked out. The staff seemed very nice, but I cannot comment on the Doctor, since I never spoke to him/her.
__label__3	Atmosphere appears to be a minimally refurbished pub-style restaurant. Friendly service; we asked to move due to a loud cell phone talker and the server happily accommodated us. We had the sashimi combo, which was fresh and delicious but somewhat overpriced for the quantity. We also had the salmon teriyaki, which seemed somewhat overcooked. Vegetable udon noodles were also overpriced IMO due to the paucity of vegetables.  I was disappointed that there was an extra charge for fried rice not mentioned in the menu. $64 for two adults and 1 child, no alcohol.
__label__3	"Wife walked in and wanted a sandwich. This place comes up when looking for cheese steak in the area. You won't get one here. Go to pats or the rival Genos across the street. If your new in town that's what you were looking for in the first place. 

Sandwich was soso. cuts of meet were ok but somehow it was lacking. She had a few bites and tossed it. We're not locals just trying new things. Locals like this place try this place out if you want something different then a steak."
__label__3	Had a protein style steak burger. The name is a bit misleading. Just a regular hamburger. It was ok at best. The service was good. I order protein style and the lettuce was pieces not a full leaf makes it really hard to eat.  Not terrible but not somewhere I'd go to back I'm sorry to say.
__label__3	The food was decent but the waitress my boyfriend and I had was absent-minded. We ended up waiting for her to take the check so we could pay for over 20 min. She forgot my drink and when we got our meal we didn't have forks or knives to eat. The ambiance was beautiful and when it got dark outside the lights strewn throughout the place made it beautiful.
__label__3	Came here for drinks and apps. We did half a dozen regular oyster and half a dozen charbroiled oysters. They're known for their charbroiled oysters but I was not a fan personally. I thought it was a little too salty.
__label__3	The roast pork sandwich was alright, overrated.  Service was good, but the pork lacked a bit of flavor.  Other than that, it was a good experience and something new.
__label__3	This place has just an ok atmosphere with only moderately acceptable food. It's a pretty good casual place for large groups to meet up in the Franklin but I highly suggest drinking instead of eating.
__label__3	Its was okay... went for the Eat All You Can sushi at lunch for $16.95. Mochi was good though ;)
__label__3	"-kind
-fast
- good value
- average taste
- things seem cooked to order
- salsa bar is a nice perk 

Nothing to rave and nothing to complain about. It will take care of a fix and will fill your tummy."
__label__3	I stop here on my way to work to buy a few things when I need them, it's a regular grocery store, just like any other, but a bit cheaper.
__label__3	We had some Royal Reds here, service was good but portions small and shrimp were small.  Skip this place and go to Deanies in Bucktown for great seafood.
__label__3	"Food is pretty good, drinks are great.  We have eaten in and gotten takeout many times. 

The low reviews are for customer service.  They do NOT run a tight ship.  Every time I get takeout, I end up waiting 30+ minutes (and get there after 20 minutes of calling).  They have plenty of staff behind the counter, but no one speaks to customers or makes eye contact, leaving you standing there unsure if you will ever be helped."
__label__3	"Nothing interesting. Few good stores, but I wouldn't spend a lot of time here. What irritates me is the stupid stands in the middle of the court. Wth is with these grabby sellers? If I was interested I would ask you. I don't want your shit. I don't want to be jumped every 30 seconds. I know they're extra revenue, but they are very annoying.

Thank you"
__label__3	Professional. Super responsive. Lots of polishes to choose from. I've never heard of the brands. No OPI or ESSIE. I don't know if that matters to anyone. My regular mani was ok. Manicures cost $15 but I paid $18. Not sure why. I'm thinking the $3 was for the gel used to mend a break on my natural nail. However, the gel didn't hold for more than 2 days. Pic below.
__label__3	The food is just okay...now. Metro used to have really great tasting dishes. Now everything tastes too greasy and salty. I wish they had stayed consistent with their food quality. The Metro T-shirt I bought to get discounted meals gets more wear around the house instead of at the diner.  I'll visit again because the staff is really friendly and they make the trip to the dinner worthwhile.
__label__3	This place is just ok.  I'll give it points for being a lower cost alternative for decent Italian fare.  Yes, it's better than take-out, but it's not Nunzio or Sappori.  The service was fine and the atmosphere is cozy, warm, and fun.  The food just wasn't unique.  It was something I could cook in my own kitchen.
__label__3	Went in for pastries and they were okay! We always have the highest expectations for a cheese danish because of our favorite bakery back home and these did not meet the hype but overall very reasonably priced and decent flavors. The staff was friendly and they were nice and busy for a Thursday morning. The breakfast menu looked great and the crepes and quiches that we did not get to try did look delicious! Would return for a sit down breakfast or lunch.
__label__3	It's the only place open after 2am were you can get food. The pizza mediocre at best but if you're hankering for pizza and it's 3 in the morning it's the best pizza in the world, simply because it's open. The guys who work there are really nice also.
__label__3	"My fondest memories of this place include going for elementary school and breathing in an air thick with cigarette smoke, old men sitting at the bar drinking their favorite brew in between games of pool. 

This place has changed much since those days, as the rickety old computers that were less powerful then an iPad is today have been replaced by high tech graphics and futuristic looking ball returns. Sadly, the aura of the place has also changed. Call me old-fashioned, but a bowling alley will always smell of smoke for me, with strobe lights that cut through the visible layer of smoke that hangs just below the ceiling."
__label__3	Food was okay, service was terrible. The two girls working were very rude, weren't able to answer ANY questions, and stood chatting while there was a line of people waiting to order. Additionally to several of the dishes being crossed off the menu, they were also out of items that appeared to be available. Bummer. Really wanted to like it.
__label__3	Decent atmosphere. I got the grilled cheese sandwich. It was good, but in general, the restaurant needs more vegetarian menu items.
__label__3	No frills; just sit and fly.  Not too comfortable.  Prices were great! But they will charge for checked and carry on bags.   Still a good value.  Don't think I could tolerate a longer flight.
__label__3	Food was OK, nothing great.  Service good.    Fingersteaks were fine although the coating was too salty.   Prices are too high for what you get.    Probably won't go back.
__label__3	Quick service and got our food quick too!! It was our first time going here and have lived near by for many years. Will definetly go back again for the quick and good food!! Surrounding were clean and classic
__label__3	"For some reason, my trip to Fitz wasn't a very memorable experience. Food was okay, but atmosphere was great! 

To summarize, you come here for their famous cream soda. Don't expect 5 stars food experience."
__label__3	"My experience here was okay. The service wasn't very good, but the food was pretty good. We shared a bunch of different dishes that were almost all good. The only one that wasn't good was the crab salad which had squid ink in it. It was terrible!

I would go back for their starters though."
__label__3	Its a decent place for what I played (about $68 a night). Its clean but smells a bit off. The air conditioning works and parking is good. So if your on a budget its a good place to go, but if I was willing to spare some extra cash I bet the other hotels in the area would have been better.
__label__3	"Had a 2 hour wait before my flight back to Vegas, so my business partner & I stopped here for a few drinks and to get some work done.  We found a table with outlets nearby for our laptops.

They have a pretty large selection of beer, which is impressive.  I ordered a tall Shock Top.  The waitress was very friendly and fast with her service.  Since we ate a whole pizza in Atlantic City, we weren't hungry, so I can't comment on the food.

Will I return?  If I'm in this airport, you bet I will."
__label__3	Waitress was not great at all. Came over MAYBE once every 50 min. And was not friendly. Had to ask for a to go box five times. Ended up Having to go inside myself and get it myself. Fries were not seasoned AT ALL. Asked for salt. Took 30 min for it to come to the table. Only gave 3 stars because they are at least smart enough to hire the duke brothers which were great!
__label__3	Decent meal on a Saturday afternoon. I walked into an empty restaurant and stood around for several minutes before anyone appeared. Sat on the patio and enjoyed the sunny day. The chips and salsa left much to be desired. The salsa is almost a pico de gallo and very thick, not like a traditional salsa. The calamari was excellent as well as the sauce served with it. The grilled fish tacos were nice. Would eat here again just to try more things on the menu. Service was good once I was helped. Just started off on the bad note.
__label__3	I just think there needs to b a whole lot more training for servers. TO IN SURE PROMPT SERVICE (TIPS)  it's not prompt service if I have to wait for refills on water more napkins e c t.... but the food here is so good u kina have to overlook it...
__label__3	"Open indoors and out, no masks.

Good burgers and local beer options. Good service. Loud pop music and several sports games on giant screens. Good for watching a game with friends, but not for having a conversation.

Food appetizers and sides are mediocre. The website falsely boasts milkshake specials. When asked, the server said they do not serve milkshakes. Not sure why they advertise a special milkshake menu online, if they don't serve them."
__label__3	The food is pretty good, but over priced, and the atmosphere is very crowded and noisy. I think there are better places in Webster for dinner and drinks for a better value.
__label__3	Food was alright, but their brisket was eh. Potato salad was awesome.  Beers here a little in the pricey side at 6.5 a pint for the most part. It was an ok experience.
__label__3	Standard IHOP, needed to get some food late at night.  The wheat crepes were pretty tasty and the chicken Cesar salad was not good.
__label__3	"I liked this place. The outside seating was nice and great location. The arancini were good and the sauce was perfect. It's not the traditional Sicilian style, but, from a Sicilian I give it a thumbs up! 

Only gripe, the table was DIRTY when we were seated. 

Waitress was kind and edgy."
__label__3	"A good neighborhood BBQ place.  All the usual BBQ meats and sides.  Meat is well prepared and the doctored beans are particularly good.   Very good mac & cheese as well.  This place has stood the test of time in this neighborhood that has several eating places each block, and most corresponding to the ethnicity of the neighborhood.    I like it better than Sonny's but it is not as consistent.   Not quite as good as Big John's Alabama BBQ in East Tampa.

Good for take-out or eat-in.   And if you eat there, you go home smelling really good."
__label__3	Meh.  The pizza was good. For a Saturday night it was pretty empty, but you could tell who the regular crowd was.  We wasn't it.
__label__3	"Not as good, Flies and left faucet doesn't work.
Have to ask for utensils, waitress not attentive."
__label__3	Good food and specialty drinks.  Don't expect to see any actual salsa dancing - Mambo, Miami, LA, Cuban or otherwise.  Not that that bothers most - the place still hops on weekends
__label__3	Tried Davio's at a Yelp event and I'm definitely looking forward to going to their restaurant  in person to sample more.  They had a delicious platter of a variety of different meats, cheeses and veggies - all very tasty and great quality.  Loved their proscuito!
__label__3	"Warm and cozy place to meet up with friends to ""study"".  Yeah until they started transforming the place.  First there were cozy big chairs placed sporadically places throughout the store.  Within the first month of opening they took them away.  Surprised there was no riot."
__label__3	A little run down and older theater. Good prices though. We're loyal to AMC so we keep coming back.
__label__3	"I have a hard time being critical of Station given the incredibly cheap pricing. Even though it isn't the best in town, the prices keep me coming back, esp on those large catering orders.

Catering trays somewhat inconsistent - have had mozzarella sticks and chicken fingers. Sometimes they're amazing and sometimes there's no cheese inside. Overall, big fan of their cheeseburger pizza but not their buffalo chicken because of the red sauce. Would leave the reg cheese due to it usually seeming overcooked but the pepperoni pie is very good."
__label__3	"Pros:
- has a very old-world feel to it
- we had fun ambling through the grassy pathways and seeing how old (or recent) each tomb's inhabitants were
- easy to get to from the trolley

Cons:
- not very well kept; a lot of the walkways were overgrown
- surrounded by a huge wall which makes it harder to see into

Cemeteries #2 and 3 are a lot nicer with more impressive tombs and modernized structures."
__label__3	"Went off th beaten path for a cheesesteak. Parking is a challenge but do-able. Cheesesteak was ok. Good size good price. But the flavor wasn't there for me. Fried onions tasted.. watery?
Feel bad the staff was nice and best of Philly 04 and 08. Need to step it up for another orange circle!"
__label__3	The sushi is very good... but it's really hard to find bad sushi. I sat in the hibachi part of the place. Loud noises! it was someone's birthday so there were strobe lights and dance music blasting.... anyway, the food is good, if you dont feel like going somewhere too nice for sushi.
__label__3	"Not bad for Breakfast, somewhat pricy. We mainly eat here for service rather then buffet.

Service is good, food is good."
__label__3	Good breakfast spot near Fairgrounds. We had the Hanger Steak and eggs which was yummy as well as the Bacon, Spinach, and Gruyere omelette which was also good and filling. It was suppose to come with fruit or green salad which we didn't receive either. It did come with a piece of toast that was sooo good. I literally ate it by itself. I would definitely try one of their toast options in the future. The Mima's Blueberry waffle lacked flavor and the mimosas were meh...service was great though!
__label__3	Got there and there was a 30 min wait for a table of two people. They are super slow. I recommend if you're in a hurry to not come here. My server was awesome and the food was great. Upon leaving we waited like 10m before we actually got our cheese cake and we were first in line. The service at the bakery was extra slow and for some reason we couldn't get whipped cream on it because something was wrong with the hand took that they use. No discount was even taken off either. It was an ok experience
__label__3	New Orleans staple. The bread pudding with bourbon sauce is delicious . Not a fan of the bad attitudes at the cashier.
__label__3	"One of the VERY few stores in Mt Lemmon. A little too ""hippy dippy"" goods for my taste, but I can see people liking it.  I would suggest a better variety of T-shirts, more options of southwest cookbooks, and snow gear.  Maybe A nice candle selection too.

The lady working there was very nice."
__label__3	"I stayed here in November of 2019. The lobby is currently under renovation, so it may be better once it is finished, but there wasn't a bar or restaurant really to hang out in when I was there. 

I stayed in a ""suite king"" which was nice enough. There are a few hotels in a line right around here. I think there was one restaurant nearby that was somewhat in walking distance, but pretty easy to get an Uber."
__label__3	Overall, not terrible. However, the tuna was not fresh and the girl taking our order never took down any identifying information so pickup was a little tricky. The spicy tuna in our dragon roll was not spicy and the taste was lacking. I have had much better.
__label__3	Food was good, sesame chicken was one of the better ones that I have tried.  The fried wontons were soggy though.  Very disappointed.  Otherwise, I would have given more stars if only they had a crunch to them.
__label__3	Food was great! Place was clean. Service was slow and monotone. Would recommend for good food but not for customer service.
__label__3	Not bad considering I'm in Florida. Had 3 toppings Pepperoni, black olives and mushrooms. Pizza was thin crust not greasy. So why only 3 stars you might ask. Well I am from South Philly where pizza gods were born. Our bread is untouchable. Florida bread was so so & pie maker was very stingy with the toppings.  When you ask for toppings in South Philly you get toppings... But like I said not bad for Florida. ;)
__label__3	Excellent coffee and pastries, friendly service and a cute seating area all makes for a great combo.  I stopped for coffee and a pastry to go, next time, I'll stay a while and enjoy!  I loved my light and fluffy chocolate cream puff, I want to try more of what they offer.  It's not often that I get coffee downtown, but it's nice that the downtowners have this place!
__label__3	"So the first time I came here I had a great experience but I ordered again from them last night and it was like I ordered from a completely different restaurant.

We got the honey basil chicken again. The portion was much smaller and there was no chicken. It was literally just fried breading (see photos). We took a couple of bites and had to throw it away. It also looked really different from the first time I ordered it.

So I still like this place because of how good it was the first time I went, but I'm definitely more skeptical now because of the inconsistency."
__label__3	Went for a state inspection, the service department was extremely busy and lounge area was packed.  The staff is courteous and professional.  It is noteworthy, that they charge more for an inspection than BMW, who provides a loaner.  I think that it's the convenience factor.  And they are fast.
__label__3	"momma yue kee... you failed me. i was trying to show my bf how awesome your food is and his general tso's chicken literally had three small pieces of chicken swimming in sauce... that ain't right.

now, i still love your mapo tofu and your eggplant with garlic sauce, but be a little more generous with the chicken next time please!"
__label__3	Nice people, very attentive wait staff. Basic breakfast menu with a few extras. The chilaquillas are wonderful with their special sauce. I was a little disappointed in my omelette....too much oil in the vegis..,,great coffee.
__label__3	Been 2 times. Customer service was good. Place was clean. Food is mediocre. Ice cream is delish! Plenty of dessert choices, limited lunch items. They always have specials good on. Pricing is fair.
__label__3	I was at Caddy's on Thursday during the day. I was there just for the food. I ordered the fried shrimp- jerk seasoning. It was good. But then I had the half rack ribs to share, and that was pretty bland, even with the bbq sauce on it. I would go back there for the drinks and the relaxing environment on the beach, unless I was really really hungry.
__label__3	Actually, I ate at the 922 Walnut location.  It was BUSY, and we had a bit of a wait for our waffles.  But they were delicious.  We got one with blueberries and one plain. We ate them on the go, but I'll be back to try some more.
__label__3	Food is amazing but unless you're rich looking white man..you get shitty service. Sometimes they just stare at you until you order. Sometimes they walk past you several times to service the white man. Hate spending my money here. Currently looking for a new Pho spot.
__label__3	Burger was goodish much like a In out Burger. Fries are awesome. Ring's have a very crumbly batter they are kinda bland and dry. Chocolate shake with very very good. Also with modern interior design makes it a very hard surface inside and there's a horrible echo,  it's very loud and hard to have a conversation and those with hearing aids or difficulty hearing this space will pose some challenges for them.
__label__3	"Steak 'n Shakes are all pretty much the same, you've been to one, you've been to them all.

I was surprised when we walked in that there was literally no customers in the restaurant.  It was not a normal dinner time, maybe around 7.  But I figured with it being right next to the mall that they would have some business!

I'm going to close with if you really have a Steak 'n Shake craving and are in NoCo, drive the two miles to the one on McDonnell and you will have better service."
__label__3	Good friendly service. The food was all just super heavy and greasy and too rich. Would have benefited from some freshness of some kind.
__label__3	I have been a fan of this place for ages.  But I am going to have to give it up.  The food is always great, but the amount of time that one has to wait is ridiculous.  After a year of avoiding this place, I ventured out for lunch with a friend.  Well they have gotten the delivery down now, however, to the detriment of the food.  The food quality absolutely horrid now. I tried very hard to go regularly and give this business a boost, but I am afraid that I will not be going here again.
__label__3	Came out here on a business trip at the beginning of last month, and this was the first place I stopped for dinner. Got the garlic three cheese burger, and my friend was surprised with the Bru burger. She loved her burger and the mac n cheese, but I thought my burger was honestly pretty underwhelming. The garlic aioli was pretty delicious, and it was definitely the best part of the burger. Otherwise, it was very plain tasting.
__label__3	I really thought I would enjoy my experience here more than I actually did. I got the Brielle, which had the potential to be delicious. However the sandwich was just soo greasy it kind of took away from the flavor profile. There was also a relatively long wait for the sandwich, and it was more expensive than I could justify for a basic sandwich. However, I will say the brie cheese itself was delicious.
__label__3	The gym is nice and well maintained but the location is pretty out of the way if you are close to the university. Also the pricing is pretty high for what is there and having 2 locations that are so far apart. I have climbed in gyms that were as nice or nicer in the bay area so I was shocked to see the prices here. Overall just wish both gyms were in one building that is easy to go to.
__label__3	Food was pretty good. Loved the homemade chips. Server was a touch on the unpleasant side. Maybe having a bad afternoon hence the 3 star rating.  Would go back because the food was pretty good!
__label__3	It's a beautiful resort. But one or two things u would except to be clean is ur room. Mall is in walking distance
__label__3	This restaurant was... ok. Know that the noise level is very high. If you're planning to have a conversation, forget it. The food was mediocre and the kitchen was disorganized (how do you run out of grits??). The wait staff was good and tried to be as accommodating as they could be. I don't think I would go back.
__label__3	3.5 stars: I tried the lunch combination which included the satay tofu, coconut soup and red curry dish. The tofu was awful; half of the tofu was overlooked (like burnt) and it was very salty. The coconut soup was okay; a little bit runny and sweet. The red curry was good but I think it was lacking ingredients (a bit runny). Customer service was great.
__label__3	"Food: 4
Decor: 2.5
Ambiance: 3
Service: 4
Value: 2.5

A staple for geriatric dining and special events. Brunch is decent and so is the service."
__label__3	The food was delicious. Our appetizer, claws, tasted amazing and would be a great proportion if their entres were bigger. I Was left hungry afterwards and we decided to stop for a pizza slice right after leaving.  I would suggest a bit more food portions. It is a sad thing when you leave a restaurant hungry, and we are NOT big people.
__label__3	A great places to different types of food under one roof.  The atmosphere is very friendly.  The food is good.  I enjoy coming here when I visit New Orleans.
__label__3	I was hoping this place would be a family friendly location that served Irish food (my family is Irish so when we heard a place that served Irish cuisine was opening up we were excited).  Unfortunately the type of place it is is quite obvious by the waitstaff attire.  Very disappointing.  There are plenty of Hooters type sports bars around here, we didn't really need another one, but I won't post too horrible a rating for that.  Hence why I just put an average in the middle of the road rating instead.  Just not what we were expecting, sadly.
__label__3	Stayed at the Missouri Athletic Club while visiting St. Louis.  The AC in my room was cranked way up and could not be adjusted. Had several meals in the Jack Buck Grill - breakfast was the best and dinner was not very good. As this is a private club, I enjoyed listening to the members chat about other members and their guests.  One member spent most of the evening dropping F-bombs in the dining room while another member at the bar was complaining to the bartender about the members at the club's satellite location.  Also, you cannot use the athletic facilities if you are not a member.
__label__3	"We go to Canal Place Theatres a lot! Unfortunately, the theatre is becoming ratty - the seats are worn and the smell within the theatre was not so nice. Our food was mediocre. My drink was fine but my husband had to send his back. My plate was never picked up by our server and I feel as if gratuity is already included then at least do the bare minimum.

We will probably have dinner elsewhere on our next movie night. I really like this place but it seems to be going down."
__label__3	Definitely a great place to eat for those with a health conscious appetite.  The menu offered plenty of choices even though half of the menu items are just not in my appetite wheelhouse.  The ones that were in my wheelhouse (steak, cheese) all came with a slight surcharge as well.  Considering the actual size of the meal itself (a bowl of 1 protein, 1 veggie, and 2 bases) it was a tad pricey for my liking, but then again eating healthy typically is.  I would probably return here at some point, and maybe sneak in my own sides.  :-)
__label__3	It has nice attractions, some good restaurants and cafes, their airport is easy to manage and it's city is only a little less so. There's something picturesque about the way the highway hugs the river and the Cardinal's stadium.
__label__3	Bring on the fried food.  I feel my arteries clogging already.  Not the type of place that I could go very often.
__label__3	Decent food, decent service. I got the classic gyro and wasn't really impressed. It was large but mainly because it was filled with lettuce and tomato and not enough lamb. I tried the chicken wings that my friend got and they were pretty good, they had a lot of meat in them and the hot sauce was really good.
__label__3	The atmosphere was good and the beer selection was decent but the food was way over priced. I ordered a burger for $9 and it was about 1/4 lb meat that was frozen and they loaded with burger seasoning. To put it in prospective I could have gotten a bigger burger for a dollar at McDonalds.
__label__3	Pies were okay but not especially tasty. We tried coconut cream, key lime and pumpkin. Pumpkin was the best.
__label__3	I tried contacting them twice to no avail. Can't comment on their work, but unresponsiveness to potential client inquiries is important.
__label__3	Loved Lee Roys in the original Tampa location but some of the others are inconsistent. The sweet heat fried chicken is always the one consistent really good dinner, selmons brother wings have a great flavor and the pulled pork nachos are a great way to start things off. Unfortunately the pulled pork is not the best, I've had much better from mom and pop BBQ restaurants.
__label__3	DGC gets the most out of the Donald Ross design and name. Varied tee shots and unique green complexes with some tremendous bunkering. Does not drain well and is overgrown. Greens are well kept. The practice area is poor.
__label__3	I love the product selection at the Chatter's Salon in South Edmonton Common, but I don't love the customer service level in this store.  The customer service could definitely use a pick me up as most of the staff are incredibly busy with booked clients and just don't have a lot of time to interact with customers coming in off the street.  If you are knowledgable about what product you are interested in purchasing you should be fine shopping here, but if you need advice I would probably recommend going elsewhere.
__label__3	I love the orange chicken of Panda Express and am always happy eating it - be it any location. But this time I was accompanied with my spouse who doesnt eat meat. We asked for just the noodles as there were no options for vegetarians but to the surprise, we found a piece of Chicken in the noodles.
__label__3	"Not feeling excited about the look of the buffet today. Many the pans barely had food covering the bottom. Remind me of those cheaply run Chinese  buffet though I know this is not the case with Wegmans. 

Someone probably wasn't paying attention but know that people like me drive in from Pottstown and surrounding areas just for the lunch buffet and if it's looking skimpy we feel cheated."
__label__3	I wasn't too impressed with the place. I thought with Chicago pizza in the name they would have specialized in some deep dish pizza, but I thought wrong. The pizza I had was just run of the mill. I will say they had a decent selection of local and national craft beers which was nice to see. The staff was friendly, and there was plenty of TV's to catch a game. If you're in the area and want to watch a game while enjoying a brew, this is your place.
__label__3	Booked a 2 night stay here and they were having last minute construction issues going on after the first night.  For the second night, they moved us to another nice hotel across the street at no charge so we wouldn't be disturbed by the noise.  It is a very very old building and a unique experience.  Great location in the French Quarter.
__label__3	"Food: good
Price: reasonable
Service: the waitress solicited an increase to the tip from my gf while I was at the bathroom which is unacceptable and disgusting. The owner has the skin in the game, employees don't as much, so my previous 1 star may have been a bit overblown since 1 bad apple (that waitress) shouldn't ruin the rest."
__label__3	The food was good.  We had tapas.  The waiter however was honestly the worst I have ever seen.  Once we ordered he abandoned us for 45 minutes.  Didn't swing by...no refill on drinks....nothing.  We walked to the hostess stand to have them grab our check so we could pay and leave.  Maybe he forgot he had our table?  Shame....
__label__3	Hit or miss on this location. Sometimes they're prompt other times really slow. Customer service shifts wildly during the time of day and day of the week. Pretty typical for a fast food chain though.
__label__3	"1. This place is fast food, and we all know it. 
2. But they have the BEST free, hot, fresh, fluffy, garlicky, bread sticks. 

The service is the same line as McDonald's. Go in with that expectation, and you'll be fine. The new baked pasta I tried did not sit too well, and tasted a little ""weird"", but I couldn't put my finger on it. 

TIP: go in to get unlimited refills on tea, unlimited bread sticks, and stick to a small entree."
__label__3	"Fun environment, but the food was just ok. I got the corn and avacado salad with salmon and was a bit underwhelmed... but maybe that was because I expected too much. 

The ice cream was by far the best part and I am not a sweets person. There are a bunch of spots on Congress street and in the area. Hub excels in ambiance, and the food is solid but won't blow your mind."
__label__3	"Great neighborhood bar.   I had heard from a coupe people that it was a dive - it's not!   Staff was friendly and the drink specials were actually good (unlike what I typically see downtown).   The menu had a wide selection of eats - we tried the Irish nachos and they were delicious!  

It's non-smoking but it looked like there was an enclosed patio for the smokers.    Win win for everyone.   

If you happen to be around this area, hit it up!"
__label__3	Again...wait wait wait.  Make an appointment or plan to wait 2 hours!  I arrived at 7:30 am and didn't leave until.  I didn't think the staff was rude but they weren't friendly either. The lady that did my test was very quick and efficient.  Make an appointment and you should have 5 stars.
__label__3	"My wife and I ate here yesterday and had the Ume Sampler Platter. It has four pork eggrolls, four chicken wings, for crab Ragoons and four potstickers. It was pretty tasty, however I thought the pot stickers were not the best. The Service was a little slow as well.

Overall, not bad. We will go back again."
__label__3	Food is 4* but toilets are gross so 3*. Very popular. Great sushi & sweet selection.  Pho / Mongolian BBQ too.
__label__3	This place is definitely dumpy. However, they make up for it with great food and outdoor seating. I've only ever had breakfast (eggs benedict, omelette, pancakes). Never been disappointed. I've gone with people who had a deli sandwich, and they are huge and apparently delicious. Maybe not a place to go if you're trying to impress anyone, but for sure a place to go if you need some grease
__label__3	Tried this place and it is expensive the ice cream melts quickly, better to eat it inside, this franchise has been closed twice due to contamination issues it has made the news I don't think I'll return anytime soon...I do like the half sizes served
__label__3	"Their upstairs patio is nice and you get a good view of the titans stadium. I ordered their Miami vice slushy from the downstairs bar and it's good if you're into super sweet bevs. It honestly reminded me of being on a tropical vacation. That being said, the bartender downstairs was someone you could barely understand. He slurred his words and had something in his mouth the entire time he took orders. 

Upstairs they have a dj playing good country music and not just the most recent hits. They have a lot of seating, televisions, and corn hole!"
__label__3	It was my first time at Sabbatical and while I thought their food was excellent, I thought they could improve on their ambience.  I know it's Broad Ripple, and they can get away with little decor, but they really need a little help in that department.   Food was outstanding and we tried 6 different small plates.  My favorite was the beef medallions topped with blue cheese.  Yum!
__label__3	The service was good and fast my food was ready when I got there. The only thing I didn't enjoy was the food, it was pretty but it was flavorless. They give you a lot of lettuce and it just was a flavorless taco. I kinda expected more from a taco place.
__label__3	They're ok. Nice, intimate atmosphere. Staff is really nice. My chicken piccata was salty. The red sauce on the pasta wasn't very tasty.
__label__3	If I knew this was just a rebranded Seoul Kitchen - not sure but I think it is - I would never have gone in.  Take out of japchae.  Not as good as the ones i see in the photos, but not bad. Side dishes with takeout were just a  little kim chee and soy bean sprouts.
__label__3	I got an artichoke hash at the Reno location while on my Tahoe trip.  I thought the biscuit was really dry, though they do give gigantic portions!  The artichoke hash lacked flavor. Totally would give it another try though.  Next time, I'm gonna get desserts!  ;)
__label__3	"Went in to get a document notarized.  Was told ""we no longer do that due to the corona virus"". They are open for deposits, mortgage applications, etc.  Guess if there is no profit for them you can go elsewhere."
__label__3	"This place is clean has good service and selection. My husband ordered sushi and he liked it. I ordered pork belly ramen bc pork belly and ramen both are my favorite food. Nothing could go wrong right? It was rather bland and lukewarm actually. Another miss of my search for good ramen.

They have many deals and a check in deal for yelp (free sake) but you cannot combine them."
__label__3	Gave this place a try based on their Yelp reviews. Prices are all very reasonable and their specials are great. Their al pastor has great flavor but I was disappointed with how much fat was on them. I wished their salsas had a bit more of a punch. Great spot for a quick lunch. There is limited parking and they must get some sketchy non customers trying to use their restroom as they have to issue a key (always grosses me out that places do that) not their fault necessarily.
__label__3	Service not great. Price def higher than 1 dollar sign. Cost nearly $30 for just me and my husband.
__label__3	Just got off the plane and was starving . When I travel I want to eat somewhere different . I stumbled on this place and decide to go in. Place was clean and food was well prepared and seemed to be freshly made to order as advertised . I enjoyed spicy chicken sandwich with pickle on top but the size of it was a little underserved for the price . The service was hard to understand because of cultural differences and this needs to be improved . Drink selection was mainly bottled drinks which consisted of sugary drinks . Maybe having fresh tea or water could be an option ,
__label__3	"The food is average, but the prices are pretty inflated. Being in Lakeview probably attributes to a portion of the inflation. 

I like the setup and concept of the restaurant, but the food just doesn't match the price. The staff seemed friendly, but it's still hard to fathom paying almost $15 for an average burger and fries. Fries are decent, but they still don't make this a place I'd likely return. 

One benefit is that if you're craving a burger on Sunday, they are open unlike Cowbell and Fharmacy."
__label__3	The wait time was ridiculous. There were 4 open tables that were available. No one was cleaning it off. We sat for 20 minutes and watched the workers walk back and forth without even cleaning the tables off. When we were finally seated, we had to wait another 10-15 minutes for someone to come take our drink orders. Our food arrived 30 minutes later. When we went to pay for our bills, the waiter spent about 15 minutes walking around the restaurant with our debit card in hand. The food was good, but the whole experience threw us off.
__label__3	This aquarium is very small and parts of it are wholly empty. Compared to other aquariums (Boston, Chicago, Baltimore), it is a waste of time. It's also ridiculously overpriced for what it contains/offers. I wish we hadn't gone.
__label__3	"Happened in on open mike night.  Pretty good talent. 
The sliders and flat bread were good too. 
Prices decent. 
Service good and friendly.  
Very comfortable.  
We will be back."
__label__3	This is a newer Bob Evans, very clean and has a nice interior appearance.   I have dined here twice for lunch recently, good service and great breakfast menu.  Nothing wrong with this place, if you like Bob's, eat here and enjoy!
__label__3	I have been in many Mexican restaurants all over the USA but for some reason the dish I choose was lacking in flavor. But overall good was okay.
__label__3	"Not great but not terrible. Live music on Tuesdays was nice. Friendly bartenders / waitresses....

But, for what is probably more of a business hotel, the desk area in the room was conspicuously devoid of outlets. I had to unplug the coffee maker under the table to plug in my laptop. 

#firstworldproblem? Probably, but problematic nonetheless. Also, no outlets that reached the nightstands by the bed.

The clients I went to visit complained about the same issues and said they switched to the Hyatt nearby instead. #diva"
__label__3	Food was great and our waitress was awesome and patient with me as I decided on an entree to order. However, any good feelings I had were lost when my boyfriend mistakenly left his credit card behind. He realized it was missing the next day and called the restaurant to see if it had been turned in. No luck. He later discovered it had been stolen and a $5,000 charge had been made .
__label__3	I ordered the meatball parm which is served on a sesame seed bun with hand cut fries. The bag with my order seemed to weigh about 6 pounds which makes me happy lol. The sandwich comes with 4 meatballs, well seasoned, a little too salty for my taste but then again I never add salt to my food so I may be sensitive. The sandwich was a solid four star!!! I deduct a star for ambiance, and seating accommodations but i would definitely go back for more great sandwiches.
__label__3	"Overrated. Over plated. 
A attempt at something great but falls short. 
Chef ego oriented rather then customer care and food basics.
There are a few solid menu items. 
Happy Hour is well desgined. 
Service is quality. 
Atmosphere is quality. 
Food just needs to improve for that price point. 
I have been there 6 times before writing this review. 6 apps and 6 entree's. So this is the real news here. 3 stars because it's not terrible, its just not top notch."
__label__3	Great selection of products, but when it comes to check out, it's always SO SLOW. I will walk in and know exactly what I want to buy and have it in my hand walking to the register within two to three minutes, but because they literally will have three lines open with people lined up into the clothing section, my trip time will easily be twenty minutes.
__label__3	Like this place, close to the office.  Been 3 times and always get the Brussels sprouts.  PLEASE, for the love of God, cook them a little longer!
__label__3	Stopped in and got a table right away on a Saturday night.  Waiter was Joe - gruff guy, but did his job.  Salads were great, I recommend the house dressing. Chicken Parm - $17.  Worth every dollar.  Huge chicken cutlet, nice amount of cheese...pasta cooked very well.  it's a BYOB place so bring the wine and they provide you with good Italian food.  Probably will go again.
__label__3	I mean, it's airport food- and your expectations can only be so high for airport food. That being said, the menu was pretty diverse and the food, while being somewhat mediocre, was hot and satisfying. The reviewer below might have had a poor experience, but the service was actually pretty quick for us (we got up and out within the time frame of our forty minute layover) even though it was a very busy evening.
__label__3	"I've been here a few times and always been happy with the food, beer, and service.  Unfortunately though its definitely not good enough for a 5 star rating, nor does it have good enough food for a 4 star.  

Ive tried the cheeseburger, Monterrey chicken sandwich, and fish and chips here.  They have all been good, but not great and neither is the presentation.  Its a good place to go for good food, beer, and service but not great.  If your looking for something above and beyond go elsewhere, there really isn't anything here that distinguishes this brewery and restaurant from any other."
__label__3	This place has pretty decent ice cream, the only thing that's cool about it is how they make their waffle cones fresh, but I really hate how they false advertise on their website :/
__label__3	As usual, decent food, deplorable service.
__label__3	It's a faux-tiki bar with a pretty fun atmosphere and live music. I got the jerk burger, which was good. The meat and toppings were really good. However, the fried pita bun was kinda dry and chewy. The fish tacos were good, but unspectacular. They could have been more flavorful. Overall, I'd call it a pretty average meal.
__label__3	The Butter Garlic Crawfish is a lot better than the other few restaurants locally that also offers the Tossed Butter Garlic. But the crawfish bread is is a must try
__label__3	This is one of those places that really makes me wish there was a 3.5 star option.  They always have a wide variety of beers to choose from, and the bar tenders give great recommendations.  The prices, while not cheap, are not so expensive as to keep me from coming back.  The food I've tried here has been fine.  Not earth-shattering, but fine.  A great spot to meet up with some friends and/or watch a sporting event.
__label__3	Newer Wawa with gas tanks. Bigger inside than older ones in the area (like the ones right down the road) and have bathroom facilities for instance. Workers are nice. Exit out of the station can be a little dicey between people flying down 70, flying onto the entrance for 295, or zooming out of PJs.
__label__3	Food was typical bar food, nothing special. They do have a large selection of beers. The waitress was not the sharpest tool in the shed but was at least friendly. The ladies bathroom was horrible. It was filthy and I could barely stand the smell. The only reason I would go back is for the beer.
__label__3	"#243

Wife and I decided to cull the book herd as they were starting to apply for a zip code of their own. I usually donate books to the local high school library but this time it was our public library. Part of Hillsborough County Library System the Riverview branch is a serviceable library with more selections than I thought. They also have puters to use and you can check out DVDs too. Sure, it's not pretty and well used but that's fine. I'd rather it be a bit worn by use than new and shiny because no one uses it."
__label__3	I haven't shopped here in over a year. Today I wanted something good to eat and remembered their hot food is usually good. I got 2 pieces of fried whiting and scalloped potatoes. The potatoes were good but the fried fish left a lot to be desired. It was fried really, really hard and there was barely any actual meat on it. Definitely not worth it. I'll eat from here again but next time I'll try something different. The store looks great and workers that I interacted with were pleasant.
__label__3	I had the blueberry cake donut balls and although it was flavorful,  it was on the dry side. The chicken and waffles were ok.  The waffle was crispy and flavorful but the fried chicken was lacking in flavor. I think if there were more batter and or salt or something on the chicken it would tastes better. Apple fritter is fair. Nothing extraordinary.
__label__3	It's a good pie, a lot better than most in the area. The crust is thin and the sauce was nicely seasoned. It's a cute place and they're very friendly. We had a standard cheese pie, my dinner date is such a boring eater... I will return and update soon.
__label__3	"I ordered two mushroom slices to go here. When the slices came out it was still kinda lukewarm. By the time I got home there was no heat. I live about half a mile away on Main St. 

I liked the sauce. It was sweet and tasty. I'm not a fan of their mushrooms. The mushrooms looked like canned mushrooms. 

I guess my expectations are just different. Overall, try this place out and see for yourself."
__label__3	The food is okay. They have the fried wings but do not give out the radish cubes like University City location. Korean wings are best with the radish cubes and they're not difficult to make so I'm disappointed that they do t have it together.
__label__3	Service was ok initially, but bad after seated. never checked up on us, had to basically beg for service and ask someone else for help than our own server. Food was basic for the upscaled price.
__label__3	I was SO excited about unitea in the beginning. However, it has been closed 3 out of the last 5 times I have wanted to go within the past 2 months. It's frustrating when you pack up all your books and get ready to settle in for a few hours of work to realize that at 2pm on a Wednesday afternoon the place is locked. I also really miss the cupcakes. :(
__label__3	Fresh made dishes that are fairly standard. The chicken is juicy and meaty. However I feel the place is overhyped due to the trend of Nashville Hot Chicken. The Shut The Cluck up lives up to its name and burn reputation....but take away heat and you're left with average food. It was worth the one time experience but not really a place I would go to again or eveb recommend to anyone unless your goal is to try the spiciest foods.
__label__3	I typically love this place. Placed an order for the French toast through ubereats with the ice coffee(highly recommend) and empanadas (also amazing) and somehow I didn't get my French toast order. There's no way for Uber to refund me for the item not received or to speak to the restaurant directly.  Highly disappointed
__label__3	I don't expect anything to extravagant when I come to chili's but the original service was good, food was alright but damn this red headed lady was hella rude to one of the other servers and snappy, when I asked the hostess if that red headed  lady was always rude, she was yanked away by what I assume was the manager and questioned immediately within my hearing space. Like honestly you shouldn't talk to coworkers/employees that way in front of guests. Waiter (Kevin) was cool didn't both us too much
__label__3	Ok they just opened no harm no foul the ribs were really salty to me but the farm fries were great hush puppies were over cooked but ok ac and cheese was ok grean beans were good will try again next time we are in town to see if they got eveeything dialed in
__label__3	"What could possibly be better than a beach front bar and grill? 
Sunset's location is absolutely phenomenal, and it's a fun place to go sit down and have a drink and listen to live music (if you can get a table) sadly the food mediocre at best. Simple things like their chips and ""home made"" salsa appetizer they mess up by service chips and Pace Picante. If your menu says home made, make it! (Or change your menu)
Over all it's a great place to stop for a drink, although service can be slow when they get busy."
__label__3	I gave this 3 stars because the service was great it's definitely a neighborhood place. Although, the scallops were blackened with no crispy side and my halibut has soggy skin. It's a pet peeve of mine.
__label__3	"Not sure what all the hype is about here. The food was New Orleans style which is great, but everything just tasted ""ok"" this is one of my favorite cuisines and I thought it was all overpriced at this location. My husband got the rabbit which surprised us with how bland it tasted. They did have nice presentation for the food."
__label__3	love chick fi a for there chicken sandwiches and waffle fries but idk what happend with there ice cream and breakfast, ice cream used to be smooth sweet and creamy now it's just unedible...had to trash it and go to twistee treat. plus me and the wife got sick from there breakfast on diffrent visits. never again.
__label__3	I purchased a Sprouts Vanilla Soy Milk yesterday, Sept. 13 2018 and didn't notice expiration date.    Expiration date on the soy milk was September 8th 2018.     Please folks, check the expiration date on items before buying.    I thought Sprouts was a better store, I guess I was wrong!
__label__3	As a cool location to hang out with friends, Green Bench Brewing fits the bill with their industrial aesthetic and spot-on murals by a local artist.   Their beer, however, does need some work.  It's drinkable but mediocre and not always balanced; however, we anticipate that they will continue to develop their flavors and complexity since they have put so much thought into their space and equipment.  Give them some time to improve, and they should become a great addition to the local beer scene; we've been several times and plan to return.
__label__3	Been here a few times when it was less than ideal: once after a long Saturday night at the Surly Wench, and a Wednesday night when the GOP debate was on and they were some kind of bingo. Anyway, service is ok, beers were fine. The inside is a little small but the outdoor area is really beautiful. Lots of hanging plants and a local cat or two there. Usually pretty chill. I'd go back and investigate under better circumstances.
__label__3	The gelato here is generally delicious, but this is getting three stars because of the people behind the counter.  Basically, they are pretentious hipsters and make the whole experience rather unpleasant.
__label__3	The food is delicious but the service leaves a lot to be desired. We went about 630pm on a Saturday night and there were plenty of tables empty. Despite this, about half way through our meal we were being rushed to finish and to-go boxes put on our table. I hate it when the plates are being cleared from the table while we are eating. Less than an hour after sitting down,  we were basically made to feel so uncomfortable we left. The restaurant was still half empty and there were no waiting guests.
__label__3	The burger wasnt bad but it wasnt anything special either.If this is the best Nashville has I should open up a burger joint. The tater tots were excellent. Thats the only reason I gave this place three stars instead of two. The milkshake was also very good. The $8 beer was ok but Ive never meet a beer worth $8.
__label__3	I wasn't really sure what I wanted when I got there.  I decided to make a margherita pizza and have a Caesar salad.  I got a drink too.  When I paid for my lunch, I didn't realize it would set me back over $20.  The food is good.  Just be careful what you order.
__label__3	"Typical Panera. I thought the food was ok. Seems like Panera needs to do something to reinvent their business. It's so so anymore. 

I thought the lady taking our order was very patient.  I ordered a bacon and tomato grilled cheese.   It wasn't grilled, it was toasted. I'm giving them 3 stars because of false advertising."
__label__3	Food was just ok. Service was a bit slow. Beautiful views , nice ambience. Calamari was really good!!
__label__3	We stopped in because it was convenietly located at the end of a tour and we were starving. We had the apex burger and although I liked the spcial sauce but my bf didn't.
__label__3	Not a bad hotel.  The location is more convenient to Vanderbilt than downtown, but it still isn't too far away.  My wife and I were able to walk downtown a few times.  The rooms are nice, $19/day for parking is bullshit, the a/c is louder than a bastard.  This is a 3 star hotel, not 3.5 per Hotwire.  But overall good enough for the price.
__label__3	SO expensive and you don't get that much sushi. It's very fresh, though, and tastes great... I would only dine here if you have a large budget and/or aren't that hungry. My wallet cries every time I consider Kooma. Also, cramped space...
__label__3	"This past Saturday, my daughter and i visited the Kenner location and ordered our food to go. We got the Mac n Cheezy. It was pretty tasty with loads and loads of cheese. In the future we will go for the regular sandwich because the pasta really didn't add anything to it and it cost less.

I doubt I will return because I could make this sandwich at home."
__label__3	Christ alive the wait is crazy! Waited almost 1 1/2 hours, then was finally seated. Mixed drinks are hella expensive but the food is pretty good. Just a heads up they add 20% gratuity automatically for groups of four!!!
__label__3	Very expensive. Stopped in for a quick beer while walking around. I can only state that the prices seem very very expensive.  $7.00 for a draft Stella? Seems too expensive.  New owner coming soon.  Hopefully they will look at pricing.
__label__3	A restaurant is only as good as it wants to be and this one is mediocre at best. If you can hide the food in gobs of cheese and sauce, it's decent. That said, the quesadillas were our pick. The margaritas, on the other hand, were quite bad. C'mon guys, you can do better!
__label__3	You and I would have been naive to think that Target in Canada would be the same as Target in the States. People say that Canada now has more selection with Target here. In reality, it's just a more fashionable Zellers replacement that sells a few more groceries. It's true that they have brought some of the Target branded merchandise to the stores but it's far from all the American products that you can find down south. At the end of the day you'll find some items cheaper here compared to their counterparts like Walmart, but just as many items that are more expensive.
__label__3	Not as great as I had hoped. In comparison to Bamboozle, it definitely falls short in food quality and service. I can't afford to wait this long for food for lunch during work week! Also why are the portions so tiny. The decor and ambiance is really on point though and like the hot teas they serve. I had something lavender Rose and it was aromatic.
__label__3	Was disappointed with how dusty our room, end tables and tv stand were. Also, it was difficult to get our room cleaned during an appropriate time span. In NOLA, you are going back to your room often to change into pool, going out attire, to rest during a rainy patch, etc- would appreciate more prompt cleaning time.
__label__3	Their buffet hav two bars, one main entree bar, one salad bar. Selections are very limited, they have multiple same entrees rather than different selections on the same bar. Overall, taste is not bad, nann is great. Not that many vegetarian option other than fresh salad bar. Food is a bit too spicy for me. Ordered Mango yogurt drink, it is delicious. Also they offer discount if you are a student or faculty.
__label__3	Good was about average. It was good but nothing to rant and rave about.. Service was ehhhh decent. Was seated and didn't see anyone or any drinks for about 10 min. And we were the only ones in the bar area where the waitress was the bartender also. Service could have been a little better I would have given 4 stars. But overall decent place to eat and waitress was friendly when she did pop up.. I'd recommend the N. Mcarren location over this location.
__label__3	"Hermitage park is a good place to go for a bike ride, have a BBQ, play some sports and hang with friends.

It's a pretty peaceful place to enjoy a sunny day and just relax. I don't fish but you can if you want. They have great trails to go for walks and explore. It's really great for anyone who enjoys being outdoors. You can find a lot to do at Hermitage park."
__label__3	"Come for the nice views,  keep your expectations in check.  

With a bit of updating,  this place could be fabulous,  as is,  it is just ok.  

The food was better than expected,   but it is really overpriced.   The food is best compared to decent wedding food.  It just seems mass produced.  All of the dishes looked identical.   I would recommend the grouper picatta as one of the better dinners.  

For the best value,  come for lunch."
__label__3	The wings were great, the butter chicken was okay, the service was mediocre, and the drink menu was pretty sad. Having a fresh muddled peach drink is one thing- serving a dekuyper's peach syrup concoction is another.
__label__3	"Nice kolsh beer.

The place was certainly hopping when we went.  So if you like hustle and bustle, this is your place.

Interesting repurposing of a church.  I'm sure there's a way to put a big screen tv up on the altar and have it look good, but the way its up there now is weird.  Kind of messes with the esthetics and theme they have going which otherwise holds together pretty well.

Worth returning the next time I'm in the area."
__label__3	We got 4 birria tacos and chips and guac and it was $23. The tacos were good but they took forever to come out. The person behind the counter was talking nonstop to the cooks and goofing around. The tacos took almost 20 minutes to come out? How stupid. And the chips and quac was a joke the guac was so tiny and $4.99. No extra chips. Wouldn't recommend actually I will be going to other places.
__label__3	Good food. They do use a lot of oil in their dishes to be aware of that. They say certain meals are MSG free, but I believe they may have used one with MSG-containing fish-oil one night. I ate a meal that I always eat there and had a reaction right after I finished eating. MSG is one of the only things I am sensitive or allergic to.
__label__3	We were excited to try GiGi's and we left a little disappointed. Appetizer choices are limited but the amazing garlic bread makes up for that. We had a simple salad that was good and the white bean appetizer and that's when the garlic started. All of our pastas had so much garlic you couldn't taste anything else. Portions are very large, too large. We would try it again if they cut down on the garlic, it's overkill in everything.
__label__3	Had a Great time here on a Friday night. The Band- The Impacts, was a great 60's group. The crowd loved them and everyone had a great time. It's a hidden gem! The service was good, but the food left something to be desired. But we went for the Music & dancing, which did not disappoint! I will so go back here.
__label__3	The pizza was decent, but REALLY greasy. I guess some people like that. I've only gotten delivery because I hate seeing that place, it looks gross. Could've done better but it's a desperate option.
__label__3	"GREAT STORE AND VERY FRIENDLY AND HELPFUL MANAGERS.  THE CASHIERS ARE VERY accommodating.  WILL be glad when the sale prices in their ad and on the shelf ring up correctly at the checkstand.  Tired of going back to get it corrected. 
Guess the best thing to do is ask the cashiers to slow down so zi can check the sale items as they are scanned 
  Not convenient for the customers waiting in line. 

."
__label__3	Decided to come here with some girlfriends on a Friday night and this place was more so on the empty side. Decided to stick to the safe side and order a gyro, which wasn't terrible but also wasn't the best. For the price I'd expect it to cost more than the small shack that serves gyros for $5, rather than $18. Server was nice and attentive. Overall, overpriced and will probably not return.
__label__3	It okay not great. Nice atmosphere and great location on 4th avenue.
__label__3	My daughters and Wife go here all of the time. They do a nice job at an average price. Nothing to get excited about. They are ok. I guess check them out for yourself.
__label__3	"My family and I stayed at the hotel over Thanksgiving. While it was a perfectly fine and comfortable stay, this is not a luxury hotel as it claims. It feels 
like a Marriott Courtyard (the newer ones) - modern design, no frills, inexpensive finishes. I would've been fine with that but I was expecting so much more!! I think they just need to market the hotel differently. The staff was super friendly and courteous so that was a plus. The street noise goes on for a while, until about midnight but overall generally quiet."
__label__3	Doctor and procedure was great. Wait times in their office while they rolled in catered lunches for their staff were disturbing and unprofessional. Indicating a $200 charge per client per-visit for operating during a pandemic is also disturbing. Although they claim we are not paying for it, I feel this documentation is for some greater purpose, and ultimately to fleece America. With a busy bustling office, the math on this charge indicates they are pursuing over $8-million/year from someone (the government?). Concerning.
__label__3	not such a bad place...the restaurant does not have food from everywhere in the world. They have pasta, chicken, salad and very expensive sushi. A california roll is around $8 and its the like the ones you can find in supermarkets. The pasta is good tho!! That ia the only raeson why I go to Pangea, for their pasta.
__label__3	This place could move up in my book very easily.  The food was good and reasonably priced.  My issue is the service.  Actually its not that the service was bad or unfriendly --  the place just seems to be disorganized.  Our reservation for four was lost , then we pointed it out in the book after waiting a bit.  Upstairs dining seemed to have our waitress spending most of her time running downstairs for long periods.  Main dishes were quite tasty, but the real treat was the deserts from Sugaree.
__label__3	This Burger King was recently remodeled and is very nice on the inside.  The service is generally pretty quick and we are in and out in no time.  The food is typically comes out hot and fresh.  There had been a couple of occasions where we've had to return the food. Overall food BK.
__label__3	"Just returned from NY (no OB where we live).we found there is no longer the Outback Special (6oz serloin w/salad+potato) for $9.99. My husband got the 9oz serloin etc.-steak not up to par. Add the shrimp skewer for $5.99--not worth the 4 tiny shrimp. Bring back the ""special"" your noted for..At 6:00 no trouble getting a table on Thurs. wonder why not busier?"
__label__3	Since the beginning of the pandemic I have not gone into restaurants to be safe. But I figured the restaurants were following protocol and decided it was time.  I was shocked to see in the area we sat in there was absolutely no social distancing. The busier they got the more packed in it became.  So much so it was hard getting in and out from the table we were at. This really should be monitored better.
__label__3	Food was ok, nothing really great. Had the Frog Legs & BBQ shrimp for appetizer, had the spaghetti w/ craw fish and garlic crusted fish. The frog legs were the better of the 2 appetizer and the garlic crusted fish was the better entree
__label__3	"I live the new renovation. It changes the tone of the restaurant from a ""regular"" Earls to something a but more special. The staff are usually on their toes and they understand that often lunch needs to be quick. The food is reasonable and comes quickly and is always presented in a pleasing manor. The restaurant in general is a great place to meet friends or colleagues for a great afternoon or evening get-together. The environment can get a bit loud at times making soft conversation difficult, but hey, it IS Earls after all!"
__label__3	"Good food and Good service.
There is Definately room for improvements.
Food was a little over-cooked and waiter could know the menu better."
__label__3	I went here yesterday for a 30 minute, full body couple's massage. We both really enjoyed the massages, but there was an issue after payment. Both women who massaged us DEMANDED a tip and began to yell at us in another language. We were planning on becoming returning customers because of the great massages, but the customer service was horrible.
__label__3	Good for what it is.  If you are looking for over the top... that's not really what this place is but it is for sure better than Cosi.  While I wish there was a panera in center city, this place is probably about as close as you can get.  It's clean, in a good location for commuters, or just a nice place to have a cup of coffee if you want to avoid the starbucks crowd.
__label__3	"Well not much to say about this place really.

It is a nice little sportsbar like so many others. With the exception of a very different menu in terms of selection.
I will give that it was bit of a quiet night perhaps. And when the big sports events are happening the place is more than lively.

No complaints at all.
Food was good
Beer selection was good
Service nice and attentive.

Good for heading out for a quick beer and a bit of food.

I can't say much more."
__label__3	"The food is expensive for essentially a fast food burger joint.

For $12 I got the burger of the month, a Carolina burger, and regular fries. The burger was minuscule, but it was tasty and flavorful. I could have had two, maybe three before I was satisfied. The main ding on the burger was the size. 

The fries simply were not good. Some soggy, some too crispy, overall bland. There were a variety of sauces to dip them in, but none stood out.

I would good back for just the burger, if I was craving an expensive snack."
__label__3	"I love this place. Food is bomb, service is good. 
Turn the patio music DOWN! I've been coming to Chubbies since they opened, they never used to play music on the patio like that, especially not blaring loud like they do now! ... And Country music to boot!

C'mon guys, turn the music down. Makes me not wanna go there, and we love Chubbies"
__label__3	"We tried to select a nice restaurant for Thanksgiving. The reviews indicated this. Though it really hard to mess up a Thanksgiving meal they did. It's a difficult day for may people and perhaps a rude waiter staff was the topping. 
Perhaps a staff requirement should be to watch the wait staff at Britts Pizza. Of the 5 restaurants no staff was more efficient and friendly than that place, and 10 x more busy."
__label__3	Slow to be seated.  Outside seating vs inside seating not offered; you get what you get when you get it.  Food amount relative to prices.  Food is good but not memorable; IMO average.
__label__3	This is a decent Taco Bell they get the order right most of the time.  Occasionally they forget my Nachos and Cheese.  I'm just lucky its on my way home from the bar and they are  open late.
__label__3	Stopped here for the first time recently and took home two sandwiches. The tuna sandwich was just ok. Better tuna at other places like Jersey Mikes. Hubs had a turkey sandwich and it was pretty skimpy. Extra stars for the friendly, attentive young man who was at the counter and answered my questions with enthusiasm. Place was super clean and plenty of seating. Will give it another try sometime and try their shake and Wreck sandwich.
__label__3	"Came here for dinner a couple of months ago. The ambience of the restaurant is nice. The space is small but cosy cute. The food was just okay. The price was slightly expensive for ""just okay"" food. I would probably try a different place for dinner next time. I heard their soup and panini for lunch is pretty good. I might come back to try their lunch if I'm in the area."
__label__3	Very chilled and laid back hookah was great but food wasn't all that great. The waitress brought out the wrong hookah at first but corrected it instantly. The ambiance is what I loved about the place. Staff was friendly overall I would go back with friends but I would eat somewhere else.
__label__3	Staying here for a wedding in the downtown area. Rate was decent and location is good. Hotel very outdated and room was not very clean when we checked in, I requested additional cleaning services the next day, but not much was different. Very friendly staff, but valet service is very slow, please don't be in a rush. It's really close to Harrahs and the Riverwalk outlet. Nice city view and it's sort of noisy. There was lots of complimentary drinks and snacks during our stay. Parking is 38.00 a day!
__label__3	"Located in the heart of the tourist district...

$47 dollars a day! (ouch)

At least the clean up before dawn from the previous night."
__label__3	Pedicures are eh...quick...from start to finish they spend 15 minutes...but I get the gel extentions n they always do a great job very natural looking!
__label__3	Sometimes good, sometimes not so good. Herbsaint is mercurial, but that doesn't mean that the chef isn't talented. He is, and if you hit it right, it's a win. Staff--sometimes good, sometimes not so good. It just depends on how cool you look for the night. I like it, but it's not a place I'd recommend for tourists. You need to live there and go quite a bit to appreciate it.
__label__3	The French market has over centuries of history, open daily and close early at 6pm, full of farmers market and flea market, also hold yearly around musical events.
__label__3	"good pizza  if you like light toppings and thin crust. 20"" is really big but you can eat a lot because it's so thin. I heard that the hogies are amazing I will be trying them and reporting back
."
__label__3	I was looking for something away from bourbon to grab some alligator bites. I found this place, sat at the bar and had my food in about 5 minutes. It was pretty good. The service was great. Really nice people behind the bar, and very cool infused vodka being made for Sunday brunch!
__label__3	"Breakfast is great, anything after expect slow service and mediocre food. Waited 10 minutes for a server, and the first words she said to me was ""are you ready to order?"". No introduction, no would you like something to drink."
__label__3	This is kind of a smaller Safeway and the the people that work there are not as friendly as the one in my neighborhood.  The plus side is we enjoy getting our gas their when we have gas points to cash in.  You would think living on the SE side of town we would never go to this Safeway, but because we go tot he U of A pool several days a week it makes filling up easy.
__label__3	Came here for brunch...i ordered steak and egg...and friend ordered a pizza...have to say...it was definitely on a saltier side....I previously came here for dinner....but I don't remembered being this salty...oh yeah...it's no longer BYOB... boo...
__label__3	we came here for a quick snack. I ordered a shrimp roll, I can't remember the name of the roll but what I could remember was the fact that it was not properly cleaned... this is not ok in my book.
__label__3	Stopped by here around 5 pm and didn't realize the Terminal closed at 6 pm.  I wasn't able to get a cheesesteak at Dinic's to do a taste comparison, but was able to get one here.  I enjoyed it, but since someone else ordered it for me, it was missing cheese.  I'll want to have sweet peppers and cheese the next time I order one from here.
__label__3	Very intimate setting and the staff is very attentive.  Food was good but not outstanding.  I was expecting more considering what I paid for my meal.
__label__3	This place is alright, a bit overrated. I've had better po-boys at other mom and pop restaurants. With the long wait, I expected more from this place. Low quality gumbo and overpriced po-boys. Did not enjoy my experience here too much.
__label__3	The happy hour had about 8 drinks, majority were whisky. The atmosphere is pretty cool. It's a great date spot.
__label__3	On my way back to Tampa I stopped here to get dinner. Yelp reviews were correct; decent food, okay prices. The ladies at the front were friendly and had my food ready for pick up at the time promised. The pizza is not anything amazing yet it's better than low quality pizza chains. The stuffed shells were good yet honestly I was expecting more food for the price. I would go back if I'm around again.
__label__3	Having the elevators going out several times during the weekend is very hard especially for the elderly and those with disabilities.
__label__3	It's an ok place. Really nice people but I didn't truly like the food. Would give it another shot sometime.
__label__3	Enjoyed Carlino's for years, though definitely on the pricey side. Simple Italian fare at high end price. Still always tastes good. For the life of me I cannot understand why the extra sauce they pile on my prepared food is added BEFORE it's weighed. I'm paying a premium for the main dish, not the sauce. Only place I know who does this. Most weigh the serving for pricing, then top it off with sauce.
__label__3	"Yummy yummy pastries!! I ordered 4-egg custard tarts, 1-pineapple buns, 1-cream milk buns, 2-BBQ pork buns and a chicken bun. All this for $10!!! 

The egg custard tarts were okay. Not what I was expecting. It was almost pudding like. The cream milk bun, delicious! So soft and so sweet. The BBQ Pork Bun was delicious. I'd order more of these and probably will before I leave town. 

I'll be back!!! :D"
__label__3	stopped in here early this sunday afternoon when not much was open around the area....real friendly bartender...cool and cozy looking place.....food looked good coming out but I did not have a chance to eat here....had a yuengling bottle at $5, cider for I think $7 and a heiniken.....everything was fine but I think the beer prices r a little high.....but have said that I would definitely go back
__label__3	Finally checked this place out. First impression, it's kinda loud,  like a Texas Roadhouse. It's small and much cuter though. I assume the Service Manager greeted me. We were on a time limit so I wasn't sure we would stay. They were busy- seems the norm. She said, 'I'll take the challenge' . We had fried pickles - delish!, grilled blackened chicken-yum, tenderloin- a bit over cooked and gumballhead in tap- always a winner. Service was great!! Food was good.
__label__3	I am not a huge fan of chinese food but i went here for a ladies luncheon.. i ordered two dim sum dishes.. the first one was flavorful and fresh. I ordered chive dumplings and they were filled with chives and tasted fresh. Our waiter was attentive and friendly.. the lack of parking was a bit stressful as it does get rather crowded in there
__label__3	I would give a 5 for the theater it's self but the price for the quality of food is bad. The seats and the size of the theater is great! I just paid 3 star restaurant price for movie theater taste.  We had pizza, wings, and chicken tenders.  We went on a Saturday morning so there weren't meaning people there.
__label__3	I haven't dared to eat here yet, but this is a great place to skip by on a crawl. I've had fine service, and it's just another bar in the armpit of Courier City, BUT that's why it belongs here. This place is exemplary as the armpit of Soho, and I won't shy away fro their horribly kept billiard tables. Ever.
__label__3	The drink specials are usually decent, the food is decent, and Friday night karaoke with Skyler is awesome. The lack of stars in my review are due to slow service, which is unfortunate because it's all good otherwise. Get the tenderloin, because this is Indiana after all.
__label__3	This Marana gym is decent.  Nothing too special.  I come here for the Tuesday hip hop classes, which are a blast!
__label__3	Music was great , bartender was rude. Ordered 2 drinks. He screamed at me that he didn't have the type of beer I wanted. Asked him why he screamed at me? He said it's loud in here. I am hard of hearing...he was screaming. He than slammed down bar menu on bar. The band was good, so they helped to somewhat erase his rudeness from my memory.
__label__3	Pretty good place to have some fun. The prices are a little up there but the key is to get there and get one of their specials of the day. They always have something going on whether it's Poker or pool or whatever. That's a plus because it's not overly distracting. It's good for a great night out.
__label__3	3.5 stars. The decor is gorgeous. The happy hour is a nice touch. Two dollars off although I didn't see the exact hours this was honored. My first margarita was delicious with house made sour mix. We then ordered a pitcher and could not taste a bit of alcohol. Seriously I'm questioning if they added tequila. The food is medicore. The flavors are bland and just off. I see potential and I hope they can make the necessary adjustments.
__label__3	"Funny but I stumbled upon this deli via a catering order placed through work.  The food is great but the woman who takes your order is the epitome of a ""Soup Nazi.""  So if you want good deli food you have to put up with her snarky personality."
__label__3	I was already in the pedicure chair when I checked in and read the reviews! Of course that freaked me out a bit. The place is clean and fancy. No one is friendly but that is ok with me. The pedicure looks great and I'm happy with it.
__label__3	Good roast beef sandwich, i think is just as good as Arby's Roast Beef Sanwich :P
__label__3	Really standard. Not excellent. Pretty pricey. Didn't fully remodel after it got hit by the storm. My screen had a water stain.
__label__3	I haven't been here since i was a child, about 15 years ago. The course seemed a bit outdated and needed some repairs. In some of the holes it actually affected the ball going in due to the course falling apart. I enjoyed this overall but would have liked it more if it we updated. The person that checked us in and took the money for the course unfortunately was not the friendliest,either.
__label__3	I know one should never judge a restaurant before being open at least a month, but I went to Dr BBQ anyway. Kind of a disappointment, not bad but not great. The St Louis ribs were OK, sauces totally bland. Similarly the baked beans were bland. Overall an OK restaurant but certainly nothing special.
__label__3	I'm shocked that they have Hash House A Go Go here! The only other places I've seen that was in San Diego and in Las Vegas. Aside from the restaurant there's not much to do at Harrah's. It's across the street from Circus Circus, Silver Legacy and El Dorado. I feel like it would have done much better if it were joint to those three hotels. When we went inside it was pretty much empty even for a weekend.
__label__3	Food is solid and they have many unique options such as elk and wild boar. Definitely check out their menu if you are interested. Small portion compared to most burger places. The only downside is that the service is super slow - not enough waiter/waitresses. To be honest, this place doesn't have to be a sit down restaurant and will do just fine allowing self service. My roommate and I waited over 40 minutes for our burgers, which was a bit annoying.
__label__3	I'm here for work and my work booked my room here personally I would've never picked this place I pull up and one of the windows are broken to one of the rooms looks unsafe not to clean  :-/ note to self check out the area before you book
__label__3	"I had laura. As soon as i entered...i didn't feel welcomed. I felt like i wasn't ""cool"", ""green"" or ""yuppie"" enough for an exercise/meditation developed by my ancestors. Sorry i didn't have a yogi mat or fancy ""sham-wow"" towel. Anyways, The point is that the length of the session was worth it but the scenario and the ""DON'T LOOK ANYWHERE ELSE""  but at your mirror section was just not as helpful as i had hoped."
__label__3	"The chargrilled oysters were some of the best that we had while in town. The seafood omelette was just ""ok"" so I guess I'm slightly disappointed. However the wait staff can create a negative experience. Even though we can during a brunch rush, our waitress would consistently forget simple requests like butter for our biscuits or drink refills. 

But again, the oysters are what you come for and they did not disappoint."
__label__3	Pretty straight forward place to get your legal drugs and just about anything else that you may require in your daily life. Staff seems decent enough an can point you in the right direction for what your looking for. They carry seemingly everything from bottle wine to fat burners. Store is kept pretty clean as is the parking lot.
__label__3	Drinks are ok, but the mexican food is nothing special.
__label__3	I'm sure this is fine if you're a regular, but the volume of the bartender is hard to take if you're trying to have a conversation.  Great light food options.
__label__3	Don't bother with the Miso Soup, it's fairly obvious that they're using the pre-packaged stuff and not actually making it from scratch.
__label__3	"I've been to some pretty bad mcdonalds and this is definitely not the worst one. It's a relatively big McDonald and for it's size and location it is kept pretty clean. The surroundings of this McDonald's can seem a little ghetto at times, but if you can get past that it's pretty nice inside. 

The service here is good as well. Not that fast. I went during a non peak hour as well and it looked like they were all just playing around on the other side of the register. 

But all in all you can fill most of your McD cravings here."
__label__3	Fair.  General-type buffet - think Golden Coral although I think there are less choices.  One large room so it is quite noisy.  Very busy when we were there.
__label__3	Small place, cool atmosphere, so servers are all very casual. Their happy hour deal is awesome, $1 tacos! But other than that the food is so overpriced for such small portions; taste is also average.
__label__3	I grew up in Florida next to a huge Greek community so I am well versed in the all things Greek. Spiro's was good but not great. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, the dining area is clean. Thing's are a little pricey but not too bad. I've only been here once and got the Chicken Piccata. It was good, but not great. Also they put your plate over the little fire burner until it boils making it pointless to even try and eat for at least 15 minutes.
__label__3	Having a Sluricaine tonight! Hello New Orleans. They updated some restauramnts in the airport but needs more bars and food stands.
__label__3	Staff was utterly rude. Ambiance was ruined by giant balloons on the tables. However, there was live a Jazz group that comes to each table asking for song choices and the portions of the meals were rather large. Instead I would recommend their sister location called Brennan's. Cheaper, better ambiance and staff is wonderful.
__label__3	The food was good.  Young lady that prepared my burrito was very good in preparing my meal.  I can't say much for the rest of the staff as there were too many people standing around.  Not sure what was going on there.  Restaurant was very clean.  I will go back and I recommend it to anyone who loves Tex-Mex food.
__label__3	The food is ok.  They have music on Saturdays.  A brew pub that doesn't know what a boilermaker is is a bit disappointing.  Friends swear by the sauce.
__label__3	"Tip:
-self park is $20. Overnight valet is $27. 
-wifi is not free 


The lobby is gorgeous. The elevators are high tech.

 The rooms are mediocre in decor however large in size. The bed mattress is too springy and the pillows are a bit big. 

The fitness center is above average with free weights going up to 50 lbs and a large dual cable machine."
__label__3	I updated my rating to a 3 since they finally prepaid the autobody shop for the damage. I still think that they could have handled it much more professionally and I will probably never go back there again.
__label__3	It's not really a museum but rather a open warehouse where they let you loose to roam around.  Tour guide was wonderfully peppy.  And it was fun to run around and take pictures but for 20 buck I really expect more of an effort on their part. It's literally just a 15 min film and then they let you loose in a warehouse after a short talk.  I really dont know where our admission fee is going.  This place is really too expensive for what it offers.  Maybe if it was 10 dollars i may have given it 4 stars.
__label__3	Sorry to say - mediocre food. Got the biscuit sandwiches and were a bit disappointed. The wait was super long as well. Overall if you feel like you must try, come try once and judge for yourself. I wont' be back though.
__label__3	I love the Prytania Uptown. The new Canal Place location is pretty awful. We were told parking would be a maximum $8. It was $17. And all the charm of Canal Place with its good food and great cocktails is gone. It's just a theater with overpriced garbage food and stale popcorn. $17 for parking. No thanks. I'll see y'all at The Broad.
__label__3	Uncomplicated sports restaurant/ bar.  Went in 6pm on sun, 2 games wrapping up.  BBQ chicken entree good, curly fries, salad included.all good and will come back. Server nice and efficient.  Just above avg in everything.
__label__3	Today's flea market and farmers market was held at the race street pier and the cherry street pier.   If was smaller then I thought but I was able to find a few things I couldn't leave without.  A flower pot bicycle and a beautiful handkerchief.   Had lunch at the taco stand which was spicy and delicious especially the corn.     And at the farmers market purchased some homemade bread.
__label__3	My food tasted pretty good, the chicken thighs were the best! However the staff was not so friendly, the lady did not answer when I said hi and showed attitude when my friend asked to replace the burned carrots. My friend was not happy with her food either, as she thought the tofu should not be cold.
__label__3	My first visit was 3/14/14 through a groupon coupon. I will say that that atmosphere was pleasant and the food was prepared ok, just not spicy  enough for my taste. my mom and I  ordered the chicken taco salad and we both agreed that it was vert bland, took it home and added some much needed spice.
__label__3	Great ingredients, the option of fries and cuts are unique , a large verity of sauces, and a nice atmosphere. Way over priced. Burger(classic), small russet fries, and a beer cost me 15 bucks! I'd expect something like that at a restaurant that provided table service, not a order at the counter burger (well fries I guess) joint.
__label__3	"ラウンジが無いので(-_-;)
電源のある落ち着けるカフェやバーも少ないし、時間を潰すのに困る。もう少し、何とかなりませんか？"
__label__3	"Now called Monkey Business.
Fish tacos were very good. Large tenderloins. Onion rings were so-so. They allowed us to bring in a birthday cake."
__label__3	Food was good, wait staff was good...nothing spectacular but the hollandaise sauce was awful.
__label__3	Since this place is newly opened, we would give it a try. I had shrimp with cashew nuts lunch special.  Good fried rice came with the entrée, not so salty nor greasy. Shrimp was medium size  with OK freshness. I was glad that the veget part  - carrot, mushroom , one kind of crunchy melon ( I don't know the name but I like it very much) were all fresh. Good amount of cashew stirred fry in the tasty sauce. The portion was big . A can of soda was included in the $5.30 lunch special. What a good deal!
__label__3	I would love to stop in and get more flavors then Acme offers,  but your hours are inconvenient.  Close at 4 ???? No weekend hours ???? Especially during the summer,  your  hours need to change. For those who work till 5. How are your hours acceptable & no weekends???? You would probably have more business if your hours were better
__label__3	Was visiting for the weekend and popped in for a late lunch.  As I tourist I naturally had a blackened grouper sandwich which was very good.  I loved the patio and it looks like it might really get fun at night.  If you're staying in the area this place will do but I wouldn't go out of my way.  Seems like it would be great for a big group as it wasn't tremendously busy.
__label__3	Lots of slots, you have to pay to park, the cocktail waitresses aren't cute, drinks take forever, and everyone smokes in there..... I'd still go back though
__label__3	Driving around & neighborhood sight seeing in a trendy area of Metairie, LA, that day. Everywhere was closed or closing nearby so I found this spot. Thank gawd- I was starving. Was still learning to use yelp I'm those days. But you know walking and asking if the closest place was open was much easier. Thanks for the chicken wings and free wifi. Pool table inside.
__label__3	Surprising find in South County. I had a build-your-own breakfast sandwich and berry smoothie. My sandwich was sausage, scrambled eggs, cheddar on a biscuit. The biscuit was dry. Smoothie was good. Wish I would have went with one of their sweet treats, such as their poptart. The cashier was very friendly. The hightop chairs were uncomfortable so not the best place to stay and visit for awhile. Prices a bit high for quantity.
__label__3	"I understand the DT being slow, but slowness of this location starts at the drive up order point. 

my nephew wanted lunch. I spent 10 minutes in line and i was the only one.  his food was super hot and fresh. 

i have not been on the inside in forever so, i can not comment on the service inside."
__label__3	"I had some heels with cheap plastic heels that clicked really loudly and wanted to get them replaced with rubber heels.  It took 3 weeks and cost $20.  (I used to get this done all the time at a place in California for $10 and they'd be done in 2 days.)

When I got them back they didn't have quiet rubber heels, they had new plastic heels, just as loud as before.  They looked sturdier than the cheap heels, but still not what I asked for.  Sadly, it was a total waste of money."
__label__3	If you like lots and lots of sodium with your ramen noodles, this place is for you. Great atmosphere and super friendly staff.
__label__3	I go here often and everytime I order online something is always messed up, I put in big bold letter that I'm allergic to shellfish and they still put krab on top of my mt fuji, I ask for yum yum sauce and they forget seven times, this has been ridiculous.. I thought y'all were better than this...
__label__3	"Location is really nice. Food is average. My hot fudge sundae was fantastic. Sirloin was average if somewhat chewy. Rice pilaf was good. Caesar side salad was good. Service was iffy. Definitely overpriced. You're paying for the beach. If the prices were lower (and commensurate with the quality) this would be a 4. As it is I'm between a 3 and a 4.

As an aside, if you are a pilot, this place is almost literally a stone's throw away from Atlantic at KSBA."
__label__3	Finally had me some Home Slice and ive got to tip my hat off to you boys.  Well done.  Being a pizza snob (i dont rate pizza unless it falls into the same category as Delorenzo's Trenton, Vince's NE Philly, Denino's Staten Island, you get me...) I didnt expect much from this foo-foo Vegan friendly spot.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The pie was crisp with just enough cheese to make it stretch just enough before tearing away with each bite.  ill be back!
__label__3	This is such a disappointing place. A fancy chili's. I mean it's a regular meal and the pros are large but it is definitely lacking.  What saves this place is the atmosphere and multiple tv screens.  I guess it's a good guys spot though!
__label__3	Friday afternoons, only a few people inside. We got a table immediately. A nice waitress took our order. We got drinking. Unfortunately, we waited for food very long. In the meantime, we did not get any chips or bread. Finally when we got food, the portions were not large, the taste was very average. It was not a successful visit.
__label__3	This place was cool. I got the three meats plate,  the seasoning on the ribs and brisket was good, I didn't feel my sausage was cooked properly and my sides were not good... I still would recommend to try it but I heard good thoughts from other people in my group
__label__3	Good food, bad service. I'll give them another chance, but probably not very soon.
__label__3	"As far as ""Authentic"" goes it's not the best... Still, very good food. Only thing I will suggest to my non-Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian friends is that you should order 15-20min ahead of time and get it to go. I hardly come here, once a year if that. Mainly because the customer service never seems to improve. So pick it up, and enjoy the food at home."
__label__3	Receptionist wasn't  very  nice... other than that everything is fine
__label__3	Matt did a great job on our walkway. Very nice and professional. However, after 4 years, the brick started to crack and crumble. We called Matt and asked if he could come out and look at it. He said yes. He came out and told us he would be in touch. We never heard back from him. That was 4 months ago.
__label__3	It was a godsend, late night food close to the central business district. The food was okay, nothing too exciting, but it was affordable, hot, and I wanted jambalaya at 1AM. I had a LONG nap after the red dress run. I love that they have a a patio.
__label__3	Not a lot of healthy vegan options. I got the veggie roll, which was fine. I wanted the spring rolls, but was told they fry them. I really couldn't eat much of anything else. Luckily the roll was the perfect size that give me the sense of fullness. Our server was great, very nice. Since this is a small airport, there were not many options for food: chick-fil-a, Pei Wei, or random pizza place.
__label__3	We really wanted to love it here based on all the reviews. They were teaching people how to make our sandwiches when we went there, and we kinda wish the person *doing* the teaching had made our sandwiches instead- sadly they tasted like they were made by someone who had never made a sandwich before. We might need to give them another chance,  perhaps they were having an off day, because it took an eternity to get our food. The spicy German mustard and sauerkraut are very good.
__label__3	I live very close. Been here many times. However the last 4 times have left a bad look on my nails. I get the powder dip. And the last 4 times I have had to go back due to power not staying on or nails not smooth or they have popped off. I'm sad to say I will be looking for a new nail salon.
__label__3	Mediocre Chinese food. Very quick delivery which is always a plus! Went to the actual restaurant once and. Not fond of the environment, dingy and sad looking. We will stick to occasional food deliveries for now.
__label__3	Great service but the pasta I had was honestly ok. It's a large space though and BYOB is definitely a plus for big group gatherings.
__label__3	Extremely friendly accomodating people but my cuts there both times were sub par. The first time the fade was too high and I repeatedly requested skin tight but very low and fade up. The second time the skin tight but wasn't blended well on the fade. I was in a rush because I was on my way to an interview so I didn't check it out as thoroughly as I normally would. If the customer service wasn't so friendly it would probably be a 2.
__label__3	Food was decent for carry out  Chinese food. The place itself needs a little cleaning. The service was good, family owned and operated.
__label__3	I was in Nazareth hospital for two days Laura on the third floor at registration three did not do her job correctly I was here getting foot surgery she did not help me to the bathroom she did not give me the water she did not answer the door bell thing The RN Maria did a great job and patient care assistant Bree black lady The case manager even did outstanding job patient care assistant Liam even help dr. Ahmed did good What would you do Leslie physical therapist did a hell of a job
__label__3	The beef patties are great. I've been eating them since I was young. But the meals were always scary to me. Today I tried the stewed chicken and it was dry and bland. I'll stick to my beef patties.
__label__3	Take out chorizo tacos were absolutely swimming in a quarter inch of grease, had to eat them over the sink. Staff was friendly, salsa OK and the $4 beer I had while waiting was reasonable. Probably won't eat here again.
__label__3	Ate with a party of 5 and we tried some of everything.  Sandwiches were very good and authentic.  Service was lacking and food was a bit pricey for Latin food in Tampa Bay Area (given all the excellent lower priced options). However, the food was hot and fresh once we got it.
__label__3	Had breakfast today with hubby and friend. Very disappointed: poached eggs over cooked and buns dry buns, potatoes burned, portion get smaller too. Croissants is still good, that why 3 star. But for breakfast will not coming back.
__label__3	Love this place and the food but I am so sad today. My boyfriend was craving their truffle fries so we braved the 100 degree weather to walk there. Got there and there was a paper sign on the door saying they were closed for summer break? With no notice on their website. BRB gonna take a cold shower with no burger in my belly :(
__label__3	Space is cool! Air conditioning was not. I really enjoyed the Idle Summer. The other ciders left a not delicious taste in my mouth. I'm sure the kinks will get worked out. I'll give it another shot in a few weeks. Hopeful the ciders are all delicious. The staff was super helpful. Loved that there was a nice coffee shop co-located.
__label__3	Can't beat this place!! Where else can you get soft serve! Not the cleanest nurse finitely a classic.
__label__3	Ok ice cream over all. My mint chocolate chip had lots of ice crystals. Also, I had a weird greasy film left in my mouth. The whole group agreed that there is better ice cream in the area.
__label__3	"Constructive criticism... the staff is working so so hard and doing a great job. But people are waiting way too long just for a water. The hostess is bussing the tables while people are constantly coming in because it's a  Friday night. So those people are waiting longer just to by told that there is a wait. The ""wood fire pizza"" is doughy. I think ownership/management needs to take charge here and someone needs to step up. In my opinion I would add more wait staff and establish a manager to make sure things are in good order at all times."
__label__3	3 stars only because the oyster chef (the one with dreads) was awesome. Food came out wrong and cold. Highly disappointed with my first dining experience in New Orleans. Dine elsewhere
__label__3	"At least they had root beer.   

Everything seemed promising, friendly staff, a good schtick, and a raging cover band next door (connected). But, the burgers were bland, the fries floppy, and the jalapeño cheese fritters lacked....jalapeño.  

Don't get me wrong, ingredients were fresh, and the food came out fast.... But it never reached its potential. ... At least they had root beer."
__label__3	Food is okay. Average chinese food. Not authentic at all. Probably not going to com here again. But it is good that they have no msg.
__label__3	First horrible experience with a massage, but I was able to work with the spa director to correct it, and consequently, my housemate received an amazing massage from a chiropractor who does massage there who fixed her finger (she fell off of her bike and onto it and hurt it very badly) that had been injured for months. Definitely request Dr. Tom if you can and if you like deep tissue bodywork.
__label__3	The food here is so good and the portions are huge for what you pay at a Thai restaurant- but the hours are so wonky it's impossible to tell when they're going to be open. The service staff at the register isn't ever very friendly either. I would stop going here all together if it weren't one of the only Thai places near Clermont.
__label__3	Atmosphere is great. Fries and onion rings are also great. Burgers ... Not so much. Ordered it medium well, came out raw. They did cook it more, but by the time I got it back, the buns were soggy, and looked like a pile of slop. Totally ruined the experience. Would go back for drinks and apps.
__label__3	Meh. My 13-year old son loved it because of the huge slices of pizza. He thought they tasted good. I thought they were OK, but nothing better. I had a chicken pizza cheesesteak - VERY bland. The price was right, it was convenient to our hotel, but I wish we had wandered farther to find something better. It was not terrible and at the same time I wouldn't eat there again. Three stars because my son liked it.
__label__3	We walked in on a Saturday evening without a reservation and with the expectations that we would not have to wait for a table as it was 945pm. Our table was not ready until 1040 pm. Our only complaint with the service was that we had requested a lapse in time between receiving our appetizer and tacos, due to placing both orders at the same time. Our tacos came approximately 10 minutes after receiving our appetizer! We did not have any alcoholic drinks so I cannot comment. The food was definitely tasty! However, the nachos were saltier than we would have liked
__label__3	Last time I came here was about 2 years ago before the remodel..My husband and two kids stayed here and I was pleasantly surprised by the room. We stayed in a double queen in the north tower, it was clean and spacious. Big improvement from the last time we stayed. Also they have a Habit burger, Panda Express and Pizza place by the Midway arcade area. Not bad for families with small children.
__label__3	I drive by this place everyday and finally decided to give them a chance. The estimate was quite reasonable, but the repair was just that...reasonable. The staff was extremely friendly and the repair was extremely fast, but I would say the performance of the vacuum only increased by about 30%. Yes the vacuum runs better, but nowhere near to when it was first purchased. I would give this business 3.5/5 stars, but definitely not 4 stars. It's still worth it if you don't want to shell out a lot of money for a new vacuum.
__label__3	Doug, A top of the class guy here, I found it very difficult to communicate my requests. He gave me five to eight minutes phone time with correct answers.
__label__3	"Since they changed owners they have halfway improved.. the food still has a bit to be desired.. everytime I order my food comes out cold (hot item ordered), also they talk about their ""heaters"" on their patio...half the time they are out of propane and the other half no one knows how to turn them on."
__label__3	Wings where awful. Burger was good fries too definitely a repeat. My prime rib sandwich was not the best should have gotten a burger but my fries were great. Used Cafe Courier great on New years night.
__label__3	Updating review because Jake's removed tofu from their menu. I've been eating there a lot less since then. How hard is it to keep some tofu in the fridge?! In fact, the entire Crabby's empire on that corner seems to have few vegetarian offerings. Might as well get my burritos from Kooky Coconuts now.
__label__3	Fun place to bring a group of friends to.  The price averages out to about $5/game per person which isn't bad I suppose.  I like the place because it's a BYOB and it's easy to get to.  It can be busy at times and during league nights but you can just about always get a lane without a wait.
__label__3	Portions are small so order extra. They get bonus points for super freshness and having people answer the phone that speak and understand English. They deliver too which is rare these days for sushi places. We just moved to Camden County and are on a quest for something comparable to the mandarin group. These guys are close. They have a variety of rolls but I wish they would give a description on the menu. Finally found a place that has crunchy noodles that are NOT stale! YAY!!
__label__3	This is a tough one because the place was spotless, the service was friendly and the food was delicious... I get it that lobster is expensive, but their prices seem exceptionally high for quite small portions. I enjoyed the food but am not likely to go there again. With a tip, we spent $45 for two lobster roll sandwiches (that were pretty small) and two soft drinks. The only side was a tiny cup of coleslaw that came with each sandwich - two bites max.
__label__3	"The most reasonable priced breakfast at Gaylord Opryland Resort, $11 plus tax. Very nice breakfast. Has two ""outside"" eating areas. One overlooks the waterfall and the other the dancing water fixture."
__label__3	I found the food here to be decent.  I ordered the Grilled Lamb Kabob.  The red wine sauce was strong and sweet, but not bad overall.  I tried my cousin's Vegetable Gyro and it tasted pretty good - a good mix of fresh and cooked vegetables with the usual Greek flavors.  My cousin's birthday was last week, so they brought out a Birthday Baklava.  It's your typical baklava with some Granny Smith apple slices, orange slices, and flaming brandy.
__label__3	Food was great.  Once we got service it was great.  There was no one to be seen at the door. So my mom I sat ourselves outdoors.  4 people behind the bar and no one said a word.  We had a server pick up a check at the other end of the table and nothing.  Finally after 10 minutes or so someone came out from inside. We were on the patio. He served us. He was great. Food is amazing.  But service needs work and so does the host stand.
__label__3	"Love the food, it's so good and priced well. 

The inside is clean and cute.

However, lady with the red hair and drawn brows needs an attitude adjustment.... Like, sorry I'm a customer??

I walked in and it was as if my very presence was annoying her. Then she barks at me, ""Are YOU getting chicken?!?"" 

Um what...?"
__label__3	This is a classic overrated Nashville spot. The decor and atmosphere and 100 times better than the food and service. They are getting 3 stars mainly for their margaritas. If you find yourself in the gulch waiting for a table at another restaurant I do recommend stopping in here for a drink! The salsa is basically ketchup, it's puréed tomatoes with no flavor. The queso is an easy 3.5, good flavor, heat and consistency.
__label__3	"The one time I ate here, for a lazy weekday afternoon lunch, I was really disappointed.  It was pretty filthy inside with dirt/debris all over the floor and the sandwich I got, described as ""house-roasted turkey breast, vermont cheddar, arugula, cranberry mayo on raisin walnut bread"" was on super hard raisin walnut bread with more raisins than walnuts and the cranberry mayo was about the constituency of creamy Italian dressing.  Not sure if I would care to eat there again."
__label__3	For airport food I would return.  Steaks, bisque, crab, shrimp.  Not bad.
__label__3	Was so excited for the steamboat ride. We were one of the first ones on. Sat in the back, upper deck by bar.... mistake! If you want to hear the tour guide stay away from the bar. We had a wedding party aboard, we couldn't hear ANYTHING!! Why were they even on there if they didn't want to observe all of that history? Plus they were rich and snotty, thought they owned the place by hogging the walkways, wouldn't move!! It ruined it for my family!  Views were nice.
__label__3	The hotel stock in the area closest to the West Beach is older, but many of them have done a nice job on soft renovations and customer service. We spent NYE here, after a last minute decision to stay in SB for the weekend.  It's a motor court style hotel. The room was 1960s era small, and was clean and updated. Alas, the bed was way too soft, and squeaky. For me, that's a downer. If you like a soft bed, you may be in luck in room 26.
__label__3	Decent, but not great. The buffet, while offering a range of choices, lacked subtlety of seasoning. Both the tandoori chicken and goat curry had more bone than meat. The ambiance is ok, but not warm; the same could be said of the service. I did like the ethnic music and the spaciousness. For a mall restaurant, this one is good, but I'll probably only return when I want to visit one of the other stores.
__label__3	I ordered my food @ 8:25 and am just getting my order @ 10:15. I called and spoke to the manager, who is always nice & hospitable. i told him my food took almost 2 hrs. to get here and of course it's cold. he apologized and sent me another order within 30 minutes. that's how you treat your customers.
__label__3	We took the tour last night and enjoyed it. We had previously taken it years back and the quality of the storytelling is guide specific.  Josh our guide was knowledgeable but wanted more to discredit old myth stories since he was born in NOLA.  Sorry, but not quite the reason I signed up for this nightime particular tour.
__label__3	"We went to the Smokehouse because someone recommended their Brisket. It was more like a pot roast. It didn't really have a smokey flavor.

The sweet potato fries were just okay, and actually tasted good with the sweet BBQ sauce. 

The best thing about the smokehouse is their beer selection. They had my favorite beer on tap: Bourbon Barrel Ale."
__label__3	The BBQ was good. I cant think of anything that really turned me off and the experience was good. I have been here three times and there was just nothing that really stood out to me or made me want to keep coming back.
__label__3	"Ok, the second trip was much better than the first, maybe because the loud guy across the hall wasn't screaming into his cell phone this time.  They also are doing some renovations around the place to make it look nicer.

Still working on being able to transport this place nearer to some life, though."
__label__3	"Updating my review, every time I come here to watch football it is such a huge pain to get a table.  The past few times I've had to wait 15+ minutes while there are empty tables right there, because the table is either barely too large or too small for my party, and then ended up with a table without  a good view of the game I wanted to watch.

They REALLY don't care what you prefer as a customer, only the most efficient seating plan like it's a game of Tetris or something."
__label__3	Zaxby's is exactly what you'd expect, no better, no worse. It's fast food chicken with seasoned fries. They have drive-thru.
__label__3	The food is good, but not worth suffering the rude, arrogant frat-boy types who work behind the counter.  News Flash! You work in a deli in Ewing, NJ.  Get over yourselves!
__label__3	Not bad but not worth all the hype. Good portion of food and tasty but the texture of the ribs was leathery, seemed like it wasn't fresh, although we waited in line a long time for it.
__label__3	Service is okay. If you sit outside, you'll be lucky for them to come around. I usually get wings during happy hour and prefer them dry. They season them perfectly and I don't get the mess of the wet sauce. Pizza is a dollar during happy hour but it's not that good. Others have said burgers and ribs are good but I haven't gotten either. Usually in the summer I come here often with a group but that's usually the extent.
__label__3	I really enjoyed the food the falafel was good my Gyro was excellent overall extremely clean great service friendly environment lotta great choices for healthy food
__label__3	It's a beautiful venue in a Mall higher end group of restaurants. The staff are great and dressed to the part. The pints are cold and the food was decent. The issue hurting The Pub like many places that have beers from other countries ... they are out of a bunch. Not the first Tavern/Pub that I have seen this. I will have to give it another stop in when I am back and see again.
__label__3	"Ahh pats is definitely the king of the game. A little messy but it's juicy and full of flavor. The establishment has been open forever and is a legendary staple to Philly so It's no wonder it's a fan favorite. I opted for provolone but there was so little I forgot I even ordered it w provolone ): will definitely try the cheese whiz if I'm ever back in the area. 
Mushroom provolone steak 7.5/10"
__label__3	Was ok. I was told it was like Chow Baby in Atlanta but it definitely was not. The portion sizes are really small and pricey. I could've made this at home to be honest. The staff were very helpful and nice.
__label__3	"Came to hear my friends band perform - JUKE - GREAT BAND!! 

Local dive bar, good, cheap drinks . . . not much else to say!"
__label__3	If you like Mexican style food, you will love freebirds. Greatest tacos and burritos in Isla Vista. If you are in Santa Barbara, make the drive to Isla Vista to eat here. The food is delicious. However, the lines can be very long so be prepared to wait.
__label__3	"The service was okay. Surprisingly, they said they were packed however when we were seated it was just a handful of people. The meat tasted ""old"" for the carne asada burrito. The queso Chile melt was basically cheddar cheese microwaved on a plate. I wouldbt suggest this place as it's basic. I would suggest reading David P's review. Okay food."
__label__3	We did the lunch cruise.  It is just what we expected a slow cruise down river and there was some things on shore pointed out.  It was relaxing and yes there isn't a lot to see.  The lunch wasn't much to talk about, red beans and rice, fried fish, chicken and sausage jambalya, cole slaw and bread pudding.  To drink was iced tea or if you prefered some thing stronger, there are 3 bars.  I would not recommend this for the young active kid crowd.  Mostly you sit and watch the shoreline go by.
__label__3	I went here with my ladyfriend before she departed to work on a farm here for the next six months. I frankly wasn't in good shape to review this place but the food was pretty good. I never in a million years would have thought to combine cheese and corn as a side dish. It was kind of a revelation. Their sangria though was terrible. Maybe it was a bad batch or they make it differently in Guatemala but it was not good at all. Still, I would suggest this place if you're hanging out on 4th in Tucson.
__label__3	"Nice location...very mediocre ""chain-like"" food.  Don't get the fascination! I mean if it's the location fine but you're in beautiful Clearwater ...you have beach views all day and night ! I'd rather go to a place with awesome food and not wait an hour than a view!"
__label__3	Dinner and service was very good. Wanted a cappuccino or espresso after the meal but the cups were cold. If you can't get a good cup of cappuccino or espresso at French restaurant...they need to step it up.
__label__3	Pretty good food, however one of the waitresses (short blond hair, older woman, wears glasses) has a bad attitude and sometimes purposely ignores her tables. Never checks up on us, I had to get my check from the host one day. It's a shame because some people there are very nice but she ruined just the experience.
__label__3	I was pleasantly surprised that I liked this place.  My boyfriend and I were heading towards Headhouse Square, when we passed this pizza place. Being the adventurous type, we thought we'd give it a whirl.  Atmosphere isn't anything to write home about, but the pizza was good enough, that we basically finished the pie.  And the cherry tomato arugula salad gave our meal a nice balance.
__label__3	"Had lunch. Just OK. Asked for a muffalata sandwich, which I saw on the ""Yelp"" menu, did not see it on the restaurant menu. Was told that the Italian Grinder was the same. Not at all. Have had muffalata sandwiches in New Orleans, totally different. 
Like the decor. Service was good."
__label__3	We went here for paint night . The paint night was ok . The girl taught us how to draw , not that great but we had fun anyway . Paint night fee is $25 for each person ( if you buy cupón on Groupon ) their regular price is $45 . They don't have parking lot as you know it's in Philadelphia. If you want to come here for fun or for drawing , you better find parking little bit further. I haven't tried drink or foods in here yet . But I would like come back to try it and update my review.
__label__3	Tasty hamburgers, free popcorn and typical    sports bar food served up in a local family joint.
__label__3	First time at this restaurant.  It's cash only.  It's a typical diner with burgers and fries, chicken strips and hot dogs.  Nothing too special.  Breakfast served all day.  I chose the grilled chicken sandwich which I regret. It wasn't bad, just okay.  I should have tried the bbq pork or the country fried steak.
__label__3	Food was good. Service not so much. Server very absent. Took longer to get our drinks than it took to get food. 1.5 hours for a meal. The etoufee was warm and the drips had dried up and made me realize that it had sat under a lamp for a bit. The sweet tea was not sweet and my kid sent it back but was still on the bill. Just won't go back unless someone has a meeting or something there. Just meh.
__label__3	"This is a good Starbucks, but always SOOOO crowded.  The line is always RIDICULOUS, so I honestly avoid it unless I'm desperate for caffeine. 

And good luck finding a table, any time of day....

However, they are friendly staff, even though you're surrounded by annoying suburbanites..."
__label__3	Very good authentic Chinese foods.  Combined with multi province cuisine style cooking at a very affordable price.  Family owned restaurant.  Mom & pop diner atmosphere.  Minus one star for charging us $1 for the tea.  Which is not necessary because my generous tip has already covered that.
__label__3	"This place seems really great IF you already know what you are looking for.

The doctor working there is excellent, but most people that go here I believe are just looking for spa services.   They seemed professional and clean, but if you are used to a larger business with more of a specific business/customer service procedure I would look elsewhere.

That being said, as a veteran waxer, I had no issues here and was happy to use my groupon and receive braziliians for a great deal!"
__label__3	The ice cream was perfectly fine but myyyy goddess why so expensive?
__label__3	I love Federal Donuts and was so excited they were coming to CBP. Thats why I was so disapppointed when I stopped there yesterday. The chicken and donuts were outstanding, but the service was horrible.  I waited 3 innings in line. They had 1 person working the register, and he was moving at a snail's pace. When a 2nd register opened, the first guy left. I watched at least 10 people get out of line. A piece of advice, this is a ballpark and people want to watch the game, get moving.
__label__3	"Pretty basic place, food is ok. Server brought me the wrong wrap, ""sorry about that."" Said the price would come off the bill; didn't happen. Hmm. There are plenty of other places to eat in the area. Just sayin."
__label__3	"Food is great but don't get to-go or pickup because you will wait! Waited for 15mins to get an order of a salad and soup. Two customers in line behind me somehow got their meals delivered to the table before I had to get up and ask about mine. The explanation I was given ""just depends who finishes up first"". Here's an idea: put the faster hands on the meals for the people NOT looking to sit and eat a leisurely meal in your establishment. Just a thought!"
__label__3	Service was good, food menu is varied and was fairly cheap.  A taste of home away from home.  The veggies were fresh and the food came out fairly quickly.  Would probably come back if I have a hankering for some pho in Reno.
__label__3	Nice airport for a smallish location, not like you have any choice when travelling.
__label__3	I have been coming to this location for years and was very excited that they are now open daily until 7pm (I work nearby). I got a text alert from Primo and saw a sign advertising their new hours. I just ran to order a sandwich at 6:50 and they had shut off the lights and were cleaning. When I asked if I could order, they said no, they were done for the day. Ultimate pet peeve when it comes to businesses: honor your advertised hours!
__label__3	Food was okay. Not sure I would make it a point to come here again. Wait staff was very friendly and provided great service!!
__label__3	I had the Stanley Classic. Scrambled eggs, bacon, toast. Good but not great. Our waitress did just enough. Never anything extra.
__label__3	Our whole unit ordered cluster truck for work, and everything came exactly how we ordered. The Buffalo chicken wrap was pretty good. Next time I would just order more Buffalo sauce. The tater tots were so fried that there was no potato on the inside. Coworkers said salad and wings were great!
__label__3	I came here for a drink with my husband since it was right next to my hotel room. We bought two drinks and spend $25 with a tip. I think the drinks lacked alcohol mind you I don't drink much at all only on a special occasion I'll do a drink or two. Also the bartender wasn't very friendly, she didn't say much other than if we where ready to pay, we left very fast out of there.
__label__3	My philly and fries came out in like 2 mins!  Ordered a milkshake I'd been craving which turned out decent. No frills service but I didnt mind.
__label__3	The chicken was pretty good but it's a lil over priced. There no seating which kind of sucks, so we couldn't really eat it there. The chicken probably would've been better if we were able to sit down and enjoy it when it's fresh out the fryer.
__label__3	The first time here was great. The second time, not so much and it just seemed off. The fry machine wasn't working and milkshakes with paper straws are a no-no because they create a mess. I suggest using different straws for milkshakes.
__label__3	Not a huge fan of Chang's but I took some customers recently who like it.  I have to say that it wasn't terrible.  Their chicken soup is very good.  Of course it's not authentic, but you know that going in.  Our server was awesome.  Very attentive and took time to talk about options and how certain dishes were prepared.  Overall, not a bad choice for a customer lunch.
__label__3	Service was good. Sushi was excellent! But I order shrimp and chicken with fried rice which was over cooked . My friend  ordered orange chicken which was over cooked.. definitely will just order sushi next time
__label__3	If it weren't for ambiance, this place would be a slight step above chipotle. As someone whose eaten LA street tacos his whole life, this is the gringos version of Mexican food.
__label__3	The food here is just ok. Nothing really stood out as great and yet brunch cost something like $32. Nothing was bad, it's just that you can get way better food for that price elsewhere. On the bright side, it's a beautiful venue.
__label__3	Sorry but what killed it was the over the top extremely spicy lamb dish that I couldn't eat.  If they had cut down on the heat it would have been delicious.   The fried chicken had unrecognizable pieces and looked like it had been arbitrarily hacked with a cleaver.   The cole slaw was chopped way too coarse.  I think they need a sous chef with better knife skills.
__label__3	Decent burgers. Terrible Margaritas. I had to make myself drink it. Live music was nice. Great location.
__label__3	Awesome view from the rooftop but the drink prices are just too much. $20 for a vodka soda and a small bud light is ridiculous. Won't be returning here but the rooftop view is great. Would only recommend coming to the rooftop for a drink before heading somewhere else to continue your night.
__label__3	The place is very cute and cosy however the food is okay. I only had a salad and the truffle fries but I may go back and try their pasta.
__label__3	The Egypt exhibit is not worth the money . Only a few real items . Mostly little games for children . Very small also. Throughout the museum a lot of the interactive displays did not work . Instead of repairing them , they put a sign on it . OUT OF ORDER ! This was during Easter when there were many children there.
__label__3	"They have good food. But whenever I used to walk in, the lady looks mad as heck. I have no idea why. They should be happy they get business but everytime I go in they never smile, never acknowledge you, just wait for you to order. And they mumble....
Sad because the food is delicious but I don't come here anymore strictly because of the pity service."
__label__3	"Being a tourist we had no idea of where to eat once we arrive and checked into the hotel. We located this place by GPS and  enjoyed the food. However, it was a bit dead concerning the atmosphere, not much traffic inside but noticed  the glass doors with the bottles of wine inside. To spare readers a long story, please note that the bottles of wine kept behind the ""unlock"" glass doors located in the entry of the restaurant is not for sale. (Lol). However, the choice of drinks were good (apple martini)."
__label__3	"I dined here while in New Orleans recently.

Embassy Suites as a general rule is about middle of the road. Not economy, not luxury - just a good room, in a good building, with decent services. 

This is what you can you expect at Embassy Suites NOLA. In my case, my food took a bit long to deliver, but the bar drinks were cold and fresh. No complaints. I'd even stay here the next time I visit."
__label__3	GIANT PHILLY CHEESE STEAKS. Pretty good, not great. But the bellyfiller. Nice help. Can't go wrong.
__label__3	only thing i really love about this place is the karaoke and the Awesome Fries. the Awesome Fries are a.w.e.s.o.m.eeeeeeeeeeee. otherwise, its just a typical bar to hang out at that's also a good time.
__label__3	The food was stellar. We opted for the three course meal.. the food was stellar but the entire process took nearly three hours. The wait staff was very slow in asking for our order, delivering our drinks and getting the check for us. The experience itself is enough to make us want to go elsewhere
__label__3	Good selection of beer,,,,but the service is VERY lacking compared to other Tampa Bay Area brewers!!
__label__3	Really cool open space to hang out with a cup of coffee. Parking in the back lot. Coffee is a bit on the pricey side $5.50 for an 8oz latte, but they have unique seasonal flavors. However, coffee is just ok and does not begin to compare with the best places om the west coast like philz, blue bottle, or stumptown.
__label__3	"Recently went here on a lunch break with some coworkers.

It's like a cheap Sang Kee w/ very fast service.

Great lunch spot if you're on a budget. $6 for Duck Wonton Noodle Soup. Yum!

Next time I think I'm gonna have to try the Roast Pork on rice! Simple foods, can't be beat!"
__label__3	"My husband and I just spent our anniversary here at this hotel. I was a little skeptical when we pulled up and on the corner there were people hanging out. This is an older hotel, which you can tell. 

Overall, our stay was ok. The TV was constantly losing service and the toilet wasn't cleaned well. You could see that they do not clean under the rim and the ironing board did not have a cover. We had to use a towel.  It was just ok."
__label__3	"Thought I would give it another try, but again disappointed.   The advertised ""hickory smoked slab bacon hand cut daily"" was 3 cheap thin slices of breakfast buffet quality bacon.  The sweet potato tots were good.  Service was friendly enough but slow because they are understaffed.   

Overall it's a lively place but food is hit or miss."
__label__3	Will not honor coupon for 50% off app. Pizza was okay. Not crowded at all on a Friday at 6pm.
__label__3	this is a better bar then the Horse. the food is great if your a pizza fan. i usual get their salads which are pretty good. they  have better service then the horse too.
__label__3	"Went here for New Year's Eve. they had a live DJ and a lot of outdoor space with heaters. If it weren't for the heaters we probably wouldn't have stayed because it was freezing. 

Love the interior design of the venue. Probably not the most ideal spot to spend New Year's Eve if you're looking for something upbeat and lively."
__label__3	I got the #1 to go. The noodles were clumped together but other than that, the bowl was great! The reason for 3 stars is the price. After tax, I paid $16.39...for a bowl of ramen!
__label__3	Had the elote since this was one of the few places you can find it. It took about 20 min to get it for some reason but when I did I thought it was good but not the $4 an ear price.
__label__3	There's not much to say about this place.  My coworkers and I go there for their lunch buffet.  $12 with tip.  It's not as grandiose as the Mandarin but decent.  The only problem I have is their dessert.  Canned fruit, cookies and honeydew melon.  That's it.  I don't know if their dinner is larger but it'll do.
__label__3	It's usually pretty dead in there.  Which results in quick service, so that's cool.  The sushi is okay.
__label__3	Just ok. Kinda disappointed. Potato salad great. My water I don't think was water. The Dorito chicken sandwich was mediocre. Service bad. I had to swat gnats away.
__label__3	This was a busy seedy bar. I thought it had some character and some characters to match. Get ready to smell like an ashtray when you leave.
__label__3	Not impressed. The food was mediocre and the service was wanting. We didn't even get a menu for the first 15 minutes we were seated. Not worth the wait.
__label__3	Not my favorite spot , haven't been recently due to the low quality food and mediocre service. I will update when I check back in to this location.
__label__3	"You know when you just get that urge to spend some time in Olde City, but you don't want to ride your bike all the way to Olde City? Yeah me neither.

But the veggie wings were good! Three stars."
__label__3	"Nothing that will make this Ross stand out of the crowd. Maybe I came here on a bad day but their mens department was almost empty. I mostly came here to buy swimming shorts and left right away because their selection of shorts started from size 38, I mean there are a lot of fat people in that area but c'mon!

I'll be back in the fall to give this store another chance,"
__label__3	This location is convenient because I'm on the road in the wee hours and they are open 24 hours. The service is very slow overnight, but it's not a problem for me because I can work in the car while I wait. It might be something to consider if you are in a hurry.
__label__3	"For the past 6-8 years I've had Brazilians but nothing like Penny. Sweet, cleaning, fast and pain free!!! I'm certain I wasn't there for more then 10 minutes. Wow, I'm lucky to have her 3 minutes from my house. Ladies don't wait, this is your gal.

*** last few times I've been there not great service and careless. So different then the beginning. Plus she's not there 8-5, so make sure before you go."
__label__3	I think the location is the best thing going for this restaurant.  I am going to be a bit less generous on the food rating because I've had so much good Mexican food here in T-town.  Food at Teresa's Mosaic is only above average.  Almost everything I ordered from soup to topopo salad, I've had it better elsewhere.  Maybe one day I'll discover the signature dish from this place.  One other small annoyance is the cheap furniture and how loud the place can be if it 80% or more full.
__label__3	"Great location and lunch pick. There were several things I wanted to try so I'll definitely be back. The Buffalo Chicken Sandwhich was highly recommended so I gave it try. It was okay. Nothing really that special about it. My sweet potato fries were great. Looking forward to going back and trying the Cali Bowl or their tacos. 

Great atmosphere, lots of TV's, seating and the service was great."
__label__3	After our bad experience on Saturday, I called the owner named Joanne. She was the extremely apologetic and very genuine. She rectified the situation with her down to earth attitude and acknowledgement of her employee's mistake. I hope that our experience was a one time mistake and encourage others to go to la cocina.
__label__3	Sub-par burgers in a dingy atmosphere.   I guess you get what you pay for (although they were not cheap)    The servers were very friendly and talkative.
__label__3	The poboys here are good. Fresh, soft bread with plentiful fresh seafood and veggies. The laaarge, frosted mugs are fun. I don't care for the coleslaw. The soups were amazing- the jambalaya and the creamed artichoke= big hit. The crawfish pasta was unfortunately a miss. Fun atmosphere. When we came there was a big group of people just drinking it up and having a good time. The place is decorated with nice local memorabilia. I would come back and just stick to the poboys and soups.
__label__3	"Yesterday was my first time at U-Like Asian Buffet, and it's not bad! I did like the atmosphere, and the waiters are very nice. It is important to have good customer service and I feel like they did. The food is what you would expect for an Asian buffet, it was pretty decent. I did like the idea of creating your own Hibachi station, but a little time consuming. 

Aside from that, it was good."
__label__3	Nice place to go pick out shoes.  They have a variety of sizes and shapes of shows.  Since this is an outlet store the prices are low.
__label__3	I ordered a dinner for myself and fiancé tonight. It was the worse meal I have ever had from there. I will never order to go again.
__label__3	The food was good, but really wasn't worth what they were charging. The hibiscus drink was good, but not $12 good lol. I'd come again though. Bathroom decor was interesting.
__label__3	After reading a nice write-up in the local paper, I went and tried the lamb tagine. It was fairly bland. One olive, one lemon slice and a few potato cubes were the vegetables in the tagine. I was disappointed. The cous-cous though was very good.
__label__3	"I like the food options they have, and it's pretty convenient, but I don't think I would go back, at least not often.

Recommend: Takoyaki, Shoyu ramen 

The environment is okay. The food tastes...like what it is supposed to taste like. Nothing special about it."
__label__3	Great place to drink and eat. I personally love the atmosphere however the food is very greasy. Great service!
__label__3	I came here once for lunch and ordered a pollo taco and a pork al pastor taco. The food was fresh and had all the right toppings I would expect in a taco. I didn't find it to be particularly flavorful and found the pork and chicken to be kind of tough.
__label__3	Too bad this QT is  going downhill.  Today I was approached by someone asking for money while I was pumping gas. Vagrants are hanging out along the storefront. It just doesn't feel like a safe, pleasant environment.
__label__3	"I've been here 15 minutes one Chinese girl eating in and five people have come in and picked up there orders.  Good traffic!  

Just found out Panda Orange Chicken is General Tso Chicken.  Receipt says Huang Oriental Restaurant and I guess chopsticks are a waste of time in South Philly.  

Food is okay and could be better!  Not here for the ambience.  This won't be my first choice for Chinese food in the future.  I guess I actually need to go To Philly's Chinatown."
__label__3	I've rented from here at least 8 times with no problems or added charges (unlike some of the comments). However the phone number is an issue for me. The website number is disconnected and the yelp # has been busy for 3 hours.
__label__3	I like this place in general. My favorite is paradise point smoothie, but be aware that they do add sugar, so you need to specifically tell them not to if you do not want it. I also like their thai chicken wrap. Sometimes no matter how you order your food they will give it to you the way they know. It has such a great potential, but in my opinion not reaching that. Also there has been a high turn around rate among employees.
__label__3	The food is delicious but the portions are small. It perpetuates the myth that vegan food is not satisfying. Just make the portions bigger! Each item is around 10-15 bucks and you'll need 3 to be full, add a drink and you're looking at $50 plus. I think it's overpriced to be honest. But the food is good. If you're not a big eater this place will be a great option for you.
__label__3	"Great atmosphere ! Love the location, it is really pretty inside.. 
Great service, bartenders are really cool ! Not a problem about that.
I tried one of their pasta dishes, it sounded good by the name and I thought maybe with the way the restaurant/bar looks it will be good.
I was a bit disappointed by the plate, I really love cuisine especially as French guy.. And it was really fast pasta made, it was not bad but it was definitely not good..finished the place because I was really starving.. But either than this, great atmosphere ! Great bar! Great employees !"
__label__3	"Wow, the previous reviewers of this Maraconi Grill location are a tough crowd to please. I would give this restaurant a solid 3 stars, maybe 3.5. I thought the service was pretty good for a Friday night, and I appreciated that I didn't have to wait for a table during peak dinner time. 

One tip. The Mushroom Ravioli in Marsala Cream Sauce. Loved it. FYI Charlie Sheen, that is winning."
__label__3	Good pork, ribs are decent. Worth checking out. BBQ sauce is average thou
__label__3	Food is great but only enjoyable if you take it to-go. The music is too loud to have a business lunch; It's like a god damn nightclub in there.
__label__3	Good food court option in Boise Towne Square mall. Their menu options consist of rice or noodles with grilled teriyaki chicken, beef, or shrimp, and vegetables. The food is made to order and served hot. The chicken (thigh meat)was a bit fatty the one time I had it, but I really like the shrimp and beef. Get it with a scoop of extra teriyaki sauce, some chili and sriracha, and it's a tasty and filling meal for about $8!
__label__3	"I ordered a roast beef po boy to go. It said it came with brown gravy. There is no gravy. I called and they said it's in the meat - you can't see it. 

Not what I expected. And when I called not the reception I got when I ordered it."
__label__3	Not knowing the restaurants in Tampa and finding myself there, we stopped in at Daily Eats late on a Sunday morning. No seats were available inside, so we sat outside without discomfort because of the breeze off the water.  I had the Breakfast Fiesta with scrambled eggs,   cheddar cheese with corn, black beans Turkey sausage and guacamole. It tasted better than it looked. There was a lot of it, but to be honest, the presentation could have been better. However, it was healthy, good and filling and I left the restaurant satisfied.
__label__3	The food was pretty mediocre. The Nashville hot chicken and chicken sliders were good. My friend got the Heirloom Tomato Salad and she enjoyed it. Overall, I don't think the price is worth the food/flavors. The outdoor seating was heated but extremely cramped. It was very tight place to sit and eat. The host had trouble putting the food on the table and taking things away because of the tight space. If you really enjoy eating a bit overpriced fried chicken, then you may like this place but I might just stick to Popeyes.
__label__3	Totally 'meh' tacos in my opinion. You'll wait a while, too. I'd recommend just going to Red Dog next door and getting some bomb-a** cocktails then eating somewhere else.
__label__3	"I was here a year ago, but went on a Thursday instead of a weekend hoping the service would be better. Nope. Now, the service was personable and friendly, but no faster. Pancakes, French toast, bacon, sausage and scrambled eggs shouldn't take 30 min to fix. Even when making from scratch at home. 
It tasted good, and the portions were huge. Overall, if you have the time to kill, it's a good value."
__label__3	Good pizza ok service the positive things I will say! Asked for extra napkins An got an attitude for it! Just seems like customer service is a thing of the past!
__label__3	Nice rooms and great location, but I'm pretty sure the maid stole my vodka and they closed the Bourbon St balcony at midnight on Mardi Gras weekend. Next time we'll try a different hotel.
__label__3	"We actually didn't eat here as it seemed much too small of  items for the price of $15-16 (not sure of the real price).

Maybe I will try by myself on a weekday when it is cheaper to see how things taste."
__label__3	Drastically overpriced at $8 for a tiny salad with 4 toppings from a very limited selection.  I would recommend getting one of the pre-made salads, like the cobb or asian, which are $7 (pre-tax) and come with chicken.  I did like that the broccoli here was steamed rather than raw, though.  It's the healthiest option at the food court here and the staff are very friendly.  The high prices are to be expected and overall, inclusive of service quality, it's one of the best food options at the outlets.
__label__3	"came as part of the bike tour and were fed

fried oyster po boy
roast beef po boy

just ok, the bread was slightly dry but the oysters were good."
__label__3	Had the ribs which were better than I thought they would be..also had the wings with the garlic sauce, but they probably would have been better with the buffalo sauce.  Although the waitress was very nice and friendly she was the only waitress and service was very slow.
__label__3	Ate here for the first time for breakfast. Food was good for your normal eggs and home fries. Not impressed by the bag bought ham. Staff is nice but they just sit around when they have nothing to do. I guess being a business owner I would want them to be cleaning or doing other duties. Will have to try their lunch sometime.
__label__3	"I was really looking forward to eating here.  I was in the home of the cheesesteak (had other good cheesesteaks in this town). Old school institution. And the reviews looked good. So I made it a point to stop by on my way to the airport before I got on my plane. 

There wasn't anything ""wrong"" with my meal. I received a healthy amount of meat in my hoagie (with provolone, which I prefer).  But for some reason my cheesesteak was just ok."
__label__3	The marshmellow sauce is amazing(literally fingerlicking amazing) and the store is immaculately clean. But beyond that I don't think it's nearly as good as BurgerFi.  The burgers were obviously fresh but to me they lacked seasoning and were a little overcooked.  I'm between 3 and four stars so I'm rounding down.  Definitely worth a try but don't let the hype brain wash you into thinking its better then it is.
__label__3	"Great beers, good location, cute servers - Just Don't Order the Food!

I will qualify that and say that the appetizers were good.  The meals were crap.  No one in my party finished theirs and I swear my pizza was a frozen store-bought brand."
__label__3	"Not the best asian food restaurant

Service is great! Waiters and waitresses were all very professional. Interior design of restaurant was nice.

Price was ok, especially since you can use discount credits from casino. The food quality is the most lacking area. A lot of the food was served very dry, such as the duck. The meat was totally dry. It was probably because of the low-quality ingredients, or maybe the cooking technique. Either way the food itself was not very good.

Overall, an average chinese food place."
__label__3	Nice mall. Plenty of stores with different customer base. Good food served. BUT they're bathrooms are disgusting, even when you complained. Urinals haven't been cleaned in weeks. They have stores that pay thousands in rent, customers that spend plenty of cash but cannot spend a buck to give you someplace to go to the bathroom that's fairly clean. Management get your stuff together.
__label__3	"Hey, miss?  I am a customer, not an interruption.  

The really helpful guys in the garage across from the airport where you actually pick up the car almost make up for the woman who waited on me at the Budget counter.  No eye contact, brusque.  How did she get a job dealing with the public. 

Does Budget send its counter people to the DMV for training?  To a hospital admissions office?

Y'all might want to hire some folks away from Enterprise.  They seem to have integrated customer service into their corporate culture."
__label__3	"Nice size gym, lots of equipment.  The people (gym members) are friendly.

The men's locker room is a shame.  Lockers are super small, floor usually looks dirty, shower floors are kind of gross... so in a word, ""cleanliness"" is poor.  Clorox and a mop would be a welcome site and smell!  I don't see the cleaning staff very often.

Has lots of racquetball courts, nice pool, and a basketball court."
__label__3	"I stopped by here just to grab a coffee and was disappointed. I didn't get the chance to order any other drinks, so I can't speak on that. But for anyone who is thinking of dropping by for a simple coffee, you'd better head to McDonalds instead. The coffee very very light and tastes like it has been watered down. Upon asking about this, they told me that that's just the way their coffee is.

Again, can't speak about anything else, so ignore this review if you're looking for something else."
__label__3	I'm pretty easy when it comes to my review of hotels. The air conditioner and toilet worked fine and those are the two most important things to me.  My room seemed clean. The location of the hotel was right by a gas station where I was able to pick up late night snacks. It's also easy to get to the highway.  Everyone was very nice to me.  My only two complaints are that the wifi was not very stable and that every sports station on my tv kept going off and on.  But I had a good four night stay.
__label__3	Blackened fish was delicious. Red Beans and Rice could have simmered a bit longer. Good place, well be back.
__label__3	This place is big and it has a lot of workers. I'm just not a fan. My nail are nice but I showed her a design I wanted. It was simply, just some glitter but she couldn't do it and got mad was I asked to take it off. I won't be going out of my way to go there.
__label__3	The waitress was really nice and so was the environment but the food was OK. This was one of the first meals I had while visiting Nola. The gumbo could have been thicker. My boyfriend and his uncle asked for more rice to thicken it up. The catfish poboy had no flavor what so ever and I could not finish it. The waitress said this was because the chef was afraid of making the catfish too spicy for tourists?? I expect Cajun food when I come to Nola! The fries were good though.
__label__3	Taste was good and wings were crunchy how i like them. Service was very fast as well. However. $11 for 10 wings is way too expensive. You can go to Applebee's and get them for $0.55 each most of the time.
__label__3	I finally went to PYT tonight and it was ok. I thought they would have festive drinks since it was Cino de Mayo, but no so I ordered a regular margarita.The staff was friendly and the service was good.  The menu was pretty limited and if you don't eat beef you only have two options.I ordered the chicken burger and onion rings, they were both okay I expected more flavor. On top of that I think it is weird to have unisex bathrooms  so I have to pray I don't step in urine from the drunk guy before me.
__label__3	"It gets you where you need to go. You just can't beat their prices.  I really do prefer Amtrak but their prices are terrible.  Word to the wise, skip the reserved seating and just arrive 2 minutes before departure to get a decent seat(s).  The ""leather"" seating sucks in the summer!  My butt kept getting stuck."
__label__3	Stopped in for a drink after spotting it from down the road.  The inside bar was dark but comfortable.  The true treasure is the outdoor bar area.  This outdoor bar with cool seating areas, tables, tvs and full bar was a fun spot to hang out on a nice day.  The only unfortunate thing about the outside area is that smoking is allowed and it has walls that enclose it, so you can't escape the cigarette smoke. We each had a cider $6, and it was a one and done kinda visit.
__label__3	Really cool bar for a unique drinking experience, but drinks are upwards of $9 a piece! The mead was great, the staff was friendly, and the games they had available were fun, but those prices are unreasonable at best. I doubt I'll be back anytime soon.
__label__3	Awesome fries were absolutely awesome with real cheese! Shepards pie just ok. Nice atmosphere
__label__3	I feel like it's more about the presentation than the quality of the food.  Glad I tried it but definitely won't be my go to sushi spot.  Might go back someday for drinks...maybe...
__label__3	I had the B3 without grits- wheat toast instead of white, and my eggs over medium + coffee and bacon as the meat. Everything was good- but I didn't care much for the bacon. They should use thicker cuts. My coworker had pancakes. She enjoyed them. Overall, good experience.
__label__3	"The buffalo cheese steak is way over baring. They need to not soak it in the sauce. My roll was drenched by the time it was delivered. It fell apart. 
The greek salad was good. I'm told the regular cheese steaks are really good. Wish i would have went with that instead."
__label__3	I had the ribs and pulled pork.  They were just average.  To be clear: They were not bad, just average.  I found the place to nice not for the BBQ, but the side dishes.  Very extensive list and it's nice to be able to get greens as a side in addition to the usual fare of fries, BBQ beans, and onion rings.  By far, this is the best lunch place within a 2 mile radius, so if you are close by, this is as good as you will get.
__label__3	Good place for a business lunch. The lunch specials are a very good deal. They just seem understaffed often and that reduces my rating as it tends to slow their service level.
__label__3	The only problem for me has been that in less than a year I've had three bill pay checks lost.  The first two I convinced them not to charge me the $10 stop check charge.  Now I have to pay the $10 for the third one.  I don't know how many more times this will happen and so will probably move my checking account to another bank.  I never had this problem with Wells Fargo. My financial adviser suggested I use this bank because their rates were higher than most, but this issue is a big concern.
__label__3	Went to Ralph's for the first time, I loved the old fashioned set up, service was good however I ordered the chicken alfredo but I felt like the alfredo was lacking flavor.  Could have used more spices and garlic.  Everyone else I dined with was impressed with their dishes.  I would be willing to go back again and try something new.
__label__3	"I had a lot of hope for this place based on the reviews, but I found the food (Pineapple Fried Rice) very greasy.  The kind of greasy that makes you feel like you need a shower after eating it.  It wasn't inedible, but it wasn't remotely as good as the same dish served in other local restaurants. 

That being said, the employees couldn't have been nicer, very sociable and courteous.  Perhaps It was an off night (Thursday), but I probably wouldn't order from here again unless someone else is treating me."
__label__3	Coffee roasts are decent, and the biscotti was delicious, but the friendly staff is really what made this coffee shop stand out!
__label__3	"My first visit here was on a Monday evening for dinner.  The bar area had more actions than the restaurant area itself, but that may have been because of the Monday night game.  The service was okay, nothing to complain or brag about.

I thought the food was alright, but nothing spectacular that got my attention.  I had the Cioppino which was average.  One of my friends ordered the Halibut which she thought was a bit over cooked.  

Overall, I wouldn't mind coming back but definitely not a must come back place for me the next I visit Santa Barbara."
__label__3	So many great things about this local hangout but starting to see a decline with food and service. Example, cutting corners with the fish dip now served with stale crackers versus home made chips and carrots, cold fries. Server was in the weeds and was evident she did not want to be there, thankfully got switched to a much friendlier one. Cocktail straws not sanitary, bartender picks up at the drinking tip, icky.
__label__3	we have been to this location a couple of times for breakfast and have alway been very happy with the food.  On our last visit the service was pretty poor.  What little contact we had with our waitress was spent with her apologizing about offering poor service.  After we finished we had to wait about 20 minutes to get our check after requesting it.
__label__3	4pm on a Monday was probably not the best time to get the full experience. Despite high recommendations, I was underwhelmed by the dry brisket and equally dry ribs. I am sure the Q is great because underneath the dryness was flavor. I will have to make another trip to experience it.
__label__3	"I didn't like being asked to leave so another table could sit. Found that to be highly rude. Drinks took too long to get to the table because the bar was ""backed up."" The food was great."
__label__3	The sauce is amazing and flavor is always on point. My only issue is sometimes the ribs are extremely tough; it's really hit it miss
__label__3	Ordered my food 30min before I came I was told 20 min... I have been standing here 20 minutes... I guess they don't make the food iii t you come
__label__3	well great food and atmosphere but rather have inflation in price instead of deflation of food amount which in one year smaller shrimp smaller scallops i saw the seafood platter and could hardly enjoy it because of the size so guess ill have to do my own seafood at home but this is a problem EVERYWHERE
__label__3	"Ordered a handful of wings and fries for delivery.  The food was pretty ""meh"".  The fries were soggy, and the wings were room temperature by the time they arrived.

Perhaps its better in-store.  But with the phrase ""To Go"" in the name, it's hard not to be disappointed."
__label__3	The bakery goods all look delicious. Cream of artichoke soup was stringy and I didn't much like the flavor either. Green onion cheese biscuit was tasty. Lots of customers so this location on st Charles Ave is catching on.
__label__3	Inconsistent. But mostly ok. Generally rude service on one level or another. Either completely disinterested in serving, which is actually not that big a deal to me as long as they're efficient. Or down right make you feel like you're bothering them. Food can be great. Or a big blobby wet mess.
__label__3	This is a great dive bar but the service is ridiculously slow.  If you sit at a table you have to wait for the waiter.  You can't order a beer from the bar even if it takes 10-15 minutes to order your first round.  The food is inexpensive for a reason.  You don't go here to find good eats.  Go to Side Car or Resurrection Ale House if you want that.  Everyone is super friendly and the beer list is great.  Good service is important to me so I try to not go here often.
__label__3	The Pour House is a great place to come for happy hour, but the food can be meh. Their fries are good and I adore the goat cheese fritters, but both of the entrees I've tried (grilled cheese + shrimp tacos) were average at best. The beer selection is phenomenal. Maybe just stick to appetizers and drinks.
__label__3	I can tell that the salmon is not fresh. I ordered the lion, Alaska and salmon lover to go. The salmon on all of these roll where dried and looked old. I didn't like the lion with the garlic chili paste on top. That's kind of all I tasted on that roll. When I walked in to picked up my order, I got a glimpse into the kitchen and it looked really dirty back there. Kind of made me question sanitization and cleanliness in preparation of my sushi.
__label__3	Not a bad store, but being such a large and rather historic store, you'd expect a better selection. I have no problems with the customer service. But they have way too many shoes in this store. Seriously, like miles after miles of shoes but not enough regular clothes of coats. Walking into this store doesn't feel like a store but more of a large museum.
__label__3	Getting here from the hotel was like driving through spaghetti, then when I pulled in it felt like I was in Deliverance. No surprise after getting tailed by pickups most of the way. Figures there's a place called Cowtown nearby;
__label__3	I used to frequent this place previously about 8 years ago and recently went there again. The wings seem very dry and excessively salty. Moreover, they have increased the prices significantly. The wings are good but I would not go out of my way to get them anymore especially given the prices they are charging.
__label__3	We started going to river bend when it was in Soulard wasn't a big place but the food was great, food had very complex taste not just some cajun seasoning not to rich, that being said since they moved to big bend location the food is just the opposite to rich and thick and simple out of the jar seasonings taste.  I have given it 3 opportunities hoping the last meal was a fluke but I walked out disappointed. Sorry I won't be back.
__label__3	It's a place to experience once. There is an extremely large amount of food that you have endless small servings of. The staff is nice. The food is prepared how you like it but very expensive. Like I said, just experience it once
__label__3	"The food is tasty. Every plate is huge even though it said small because it's for 2-3 people as family style restaurant. The thing is, everytime I walk in I will pass the kitchen and the place makes me feel like it's not clean enough for restaurant.
I would say if you can ignore the kitchen and floor also the crowd. This is the place for big group."
__label__3	Lobster bisque was greasy, bland and there was only a hint of lobster. Drinks were not great Grilled Asparagus was bland no flavor, lobster Mac & Cheese was basic, 14 oz Ny strip was average little flavor. My wife ordered the Chilean Sea Bass which she said was good and the Prince Edward Island Mussels. Melissa the waitress was very attentive and accommodating....Great ambiance camouflages the food..
__label__3	Great family run cafeteria!  Packed with lots of people but they get you through the line quickly.  Servers were prompt to refill drinks and get anything you may need.  If you want a southern country style cafeteria with lots of options this is the place.  Kids are $4.99.  Large portions.  Should have split the kids meal between our two kids.
__label__3	It's okay. The food is not that delicious. We had chicken shawarma sandwich which was saucy and but a little too much turmeric that gave it a slight bitterness. Falafel sandwich was a little dry. Beef Kibbeh is soft and juicy but the taste is missing something. It doesn't have any taste. Chicken kefta sandwich was alright. It wasn't dry but again it was missing a spice, not tasty. The place is cute and has indoor and outdoor seating but it is small so large parties will not be able to fit.
__label__3	Worst wait time ever. Need better service for sure!!! Other than that a great place to vibe and drink.
__label__3	Been to this place couple times, but not as much as the one in Cool Springs. I'm not a big fan of Italian since they use too much cheese in their cuisines. However, my dad loves it! They have good dessert especially the Tiramisu. The prices are reasonable.
__label__3	Very tasty fried dumpling with an amazing dip sauce. The bright yellow sweet sauce tasted like fresh juice . Baby bok choy we're properly done with a lot of shaved garlic . But soup dumplings were mostly  empty , no soup.? It was a random draw out of two orders some full but many complete dry. One empty then the next one full of soup. Glad to see a Chinese restaurant back in the quarter will be back to try other dishes . Servers were very good and attentive.
__label__3	The food was of excellent quality, however, for what they charge for a sandwich, their portions are really small. My sandwich that I paid close to $9 for was the size of a small dinner roll. Side items are also separate and don't come with the sandwich and are almost the same price. After I ate there I was still hungry.
__label__3	This store is pretty well stocked and clean all the time. My disappointment comes from the staff. The manager is less than friendly. This morning, the cashier, Christa, made a rude comment about another customer in line, smiling, as if I was going to join in on it. Given the fact we are both white and the other customer was African American, it's hard not to think the comment she made was driven by racial differences. Furthermore, Christa is the customer service manager! Hobby Lobby, do better.
__label__3	Hmmm. People rave about their sandwiches from here and overall I'm underwhelmed. Maybe it's just what we got so we'll give it another shot. We got a kale salad, veggie sandwich and corned beef with chips and potatoes salad. Was all just okay. Had they're bagels before and they're good.
__label__3	Lots of variety but never fully pleased with the foods here...it's kinda just alright. Also noticed some food and utensils shoved in between the window and booth we were sitting in, so not the cleanest place.
__label__3	It's breadco. You're not going to get anything amazing here, I feel like chains have to be plain enough to appeal to the masses, so you're not going to get anything mind blowing here. But if you're in the need for food this place will do. The place seemed clean for the most part and the order moved fast so overall it was a good experience.
__label__3	"This one is tough to review for a few reasons:

- it's really a great establishment, well laid out and visually appealing, with the balcony seating
- they offer a $2 kids menu, which will cause any parent to automatically dance with glee 
- our meals were absolutely amazing, starters and mains
- our dessert was swoon worthy

Okay, so why am I giving three stars? Two reasons:

- service was the most inattentive and lackadaisical of our entire trip
- the kids meals were horribly overdone

But for those two points - especially the service - I would be rating an easy 5."
__label__3	The food was good, I was expecting something different from what I ordered. The customer service was not good. Also, the food came out scary quick. Rating is on food, servers get like a 1.
__label__3	"Cool alley in downtown Boise to see local ""graffiti."" Wish there was something more to go with it...but always a stop when having visitors!"
__label__3	This place is really beautiful but the drinks are pricey.
__label__3	Ate on the sidewalk, excellent people watching. Terrific early bird specials. Good Cajun food- étouffée, gumbo, fried catfish. The trout was very good. Reasonable prices, good neighborhood restaurant. Service was good, casual and relaxed.
__label__3	Beer was great, don't remember how the food was though.  Couldn't have been that great if I can't remember anything we had!  Slow wait service too.
__label__3	I Saw the reviews for Kosmos and decided to give them a try i ordered chicken Gorden blue cheese steak it was ok a little bland the delivery guy was ok and so was the guy on the phone taking the order i also got chips and soda i will try them again but i will order something else
__label__3	"The food was okay. 
It had a good taste but certainly wasn't authentic mexican. 
It's a common theme I've been finding in Reno/Sparks ""Mexican"" restaurants. 
It has this Americanized feel to it that I don't care for. 
The flautas were good and the chilaquiles left you feeling like there could have been a little more in that dish. 
Still haven't found authentic chilaquiles in this city. 
It's decent food, but I've had better from taco trucks honestly."
__label__3	Good price, below average selection in terms of editable hot foods, and always a bad feeling after; the latter probably comes with the buffet territory. Never tried their sushi.
__label__3	This was my second time having dinner at Guru. I really like the dish I get (malai kofta). Unfortunately this past experience was not as good as the first time. The people are very nice and attentive but there was a miscommunication last night regarding spicy levels. This isn't good if you ask for mild and get spicy. We were also surprised that the tandoori chicken was dry. We'll give it another try and hopefully the food will be better and more consistent with the first visit.
__label__3	"By 6pm closing time, they mean 5:30, when you ask them. By 5:30, who knows what they mean when I showed up at 5:22 and the dude manning the register gave me grief for showing up ""too close to closing time"". He took his last customer before 5:30 (5:27) turning away customers in line.
I've been coming here for years... every time I'm in town. 
I loved this place, but, my god, what a turnoff. 

BTW, put your damn mask on bro. 
Jeez."
__label__3	I actually enjoy this spot, I've been going here for years.  But I gotta tell ya, as a business owner- 7/10 times when I call someone's alittle snotty on the phone.  I've been supporting them for years like I said, and I just think it's really rude.
__label__3	Good sushi place. Sushi had good taste but there was not a lot of fish in any of the 5 rolls we ordered. Soups were a little on the sweet side and also had a lot of noodles but not much else. Service was pretty good.
__label__3	"Had a good experience. The service was fine, but the waiters were rushing my party to leave the restaurant even so it wasn't crowded and there was still time before they close.
There is a minimum mandatory amount to spend per person, what I think does not make any sense."
__label__3	"It's a laid back atmosphere which I like. The staff is a bit robotic for my taste and the food is so-so. The manager was very cool and kind. My dad's name ended up on the board at the bar; I don't know what he drank but he ended up staying for hours. He hesitated to go in because it's like a beach restaurant, and ended up liking it and having a good time. 
It's better for drinks than for food."
__label__3	I feel like they could've done a better job. Excuse the plain pink paint. They can really make any design you bring them but the shape may not be what you want.
__label__3	"New management.

Nothing that blows my mind completely away. Their smoothies are pretty darn good though.

Just wished there were more English speakers here for staff. Customer service is very big for me and I don't believe these guys are the greatest at it. Lots of language barriers to face, regardless if I can speak Viet or not. Makes it hard for me to get my point across when it comes to picking dishes or getting recommendations. 

However, the smoothies here definitely help me speak more foreign as I start to sound like I'm from a different country because of the brain freeze I get."
__label__3	None of the computers were working. And the rooms are dated, beds are soft, and they skimp on the toiletries.  But the staff is warm, friendly, hospitable and simply wonderful. The airport is a stone throw from the hotel, so it's perfect for the early morning riser and flier!
__label__3	Came here because we had a 10% off coupon. Arrived to find the place practically empty.  Ordered off the lunch menu.  Got the steak and shrimp along with some sushi.  I won't say it was bad, but I've had a lot better. I would look for another establishment unless this was the only choice.
__label__3	In the lobby of the ACE hotel - don't miss the art in the back. Exhibit by Genevieve Gaignard made the visit worthwhile - but that may have been the hotel's doing. The single communal table does not invite people to linger. The coffee was expensive for being a pretty mundane cup of joe. Espresso drinks may be more impressive, but I didn't return to find out. Three stars for the hotel's atmosphere and the fact it wasn't as charmless as Starbucks, even if it's still a major chain.
__label__3	There are limited fresh food options for vegans & vegetarians, but overall the food is alright. The produce is fresh, although I wish there were more organic options. One of the employees wasn't being careful with the shopping carts in the parking lot.
__label__3	i like the fact that you can buy a variety of breads and treats----the prices are decent----all my food had been good here---just a piece of the local flavor and if you are visiting franklin you should go----it is a busy busy place and sometimes getting a seat can be a challenge....
__label__3	"Less than impressed with today's order 
No one seemed to know what ""brown gravy"" was.
Finally they figured Our it was beef gravy.
Still tho didn't make it in my to go order bag
The second time I didn't get my side of ""brown"" gravy to go.
Guess you have to order in so they get your order right.
And you would think a restaurant out of Wisconsin would know that Canadians like brown gravy with their cheese curds!
Get your act together culvers"
__label__3	Gorgeous setting but spotty service and iffy food. We were given the wrong bill, one dessert drink was forgotten, the mushroom pasta had few mushrooms, and the skate was excessively salty (making it taste bad and raising suspicions that they were trying to hide a lack of freshness in this seafood).
__label__3	Breakfast burrito was stuffed full, though not as big a portion as I was hoping for the price.  They don't season the filling enough so it turns out you need sauce to give it some flavor and they apparently know this because they give you some salsa (?!) sauce on the side.  But salsa just isn't the right flavor to go with a breakfast burrito so I didn't use much of it.  Don't think I'd be coming there again.
__label__3	"Extremely the longest wait ever, it was is a Sunday morning so...I guess. But for the wait the food wasn't the most delicious, I ordered ""Starchy and Cluck"" (chicken and waffles) I did substitute for ""Shacks Big Crunch"" (French toast topped with corn flakes)..the chicken was like a chicken nugget so I had to order a side of bacon. Really may have to try this place one more time before I rule it out."
__label__3	"Granted I haven't gone into a sports authority in years, but this place was just ok. The salespeople are there if you need them and don't hover, which I like. But, the staff at the registers are just rude. No, I don't want to join the rewards program, don't ask me twice then ask if I'm sure. Please, it's just annoying, and amazing that as soon as I said ""no"" how curt the sales lady was."
__label__3	Mashed potatoes were weird but the salmon was amazing! A little over priced but convenient
__label__3	My son who is 11 is obsessed with his culture. In my heart I want to give it maybe a 2 star. But  it  was free to get in and he somewhat enjoyed it. It took us about 10 minutes to walk around the room. 15 if you stop and read everything. I would have loved it to be bigger and maybe offer a little more. They sold polish trinkets and a few sweets T-tshirts and *polish water ice* If you are sight seeing in the area why not . But definitely not worth a long  drive.
__label__3	Solid seafood cafe in the French Quarter near Cafe du Monde with fresh crab, fish, and oysters and a very casual atmosphere.  The servers are friendly and helpful, and I was happy with my grilled oysters and etouffee.  It's not a fancy dinner restaurant but great for a quick bite.
__label__3	Pizza was ok and the breadsticks were ok as well. I wouldn't go out of my way to get pizza here. It definitely smelled better than it tastes.
__label__3	Missing pickles on one sandwich, missing extra pickles on the other and my child was missing his juice, all of which we payed for. Meat was really good but not very much there. They're prices are high and couldn't deliver
__label__3	The food was good but not to really brag about to your friends. The people were very nice but it was too busy for just 3 workers. We had to ask for plates and utensils. If they don't want to give utensils because  you could eat the good with your hands then they just need to have it out so the customer can get what they need. They didn't have all the flavors of ice cream listed on their menu and that was disappointing. The price was good though.
__label__3	I've been here a few times and I've enjoyed it. I went Wednesday night, food was great as always, but our waitress rushed us and had a very bad attitude. I'm a server myself so I know good service and what it takes. She wasn't good.
__label__3	Very healthy food but for a hefty price. Came here for a quick to go lunch and spent $16+ on a very small Mexican chicken dish and a probiotic drink. Neither of which filled me up at all and I ended up having to go somewhere else to grab another snack. They do have many options and most are paleo, gluten free, and dairy free with some whole 30 dishes. I just wish you got more bang for your buck
__label__3	Solid breakfast fare. Ate at the counter during a busy period, but food and service were good. Coffee was good, refilled regularly -- would like to see half and half rather than Coffee-mate... Corned beef hash was tasty, with ample portion.
__label__3	You know exactly what you're getting when you walk in and it's why you're there; Bang average food and service with cheap pitcher margaritas. Cheers!
__label__3	Great amusements for children and full bar for the adults HOWEVER it is very crowded and the elevated temperature combined with the extreme body heat, and heat from the kitchen makes me wanna vomit not figuratively. Not a high end establishment so if you are a female attractive or not expect cat calls. Some of the swim attire reminds me of miami urban beach week. Im not pretentious in thr least i like high end as well as my h&m but this is not a place id be willing to come back to unless i could rent the whole place.
__label__3	"The view here was great - but I wish we just went for drinks. It is a beautiful restaurant, but the food quality was lacking. 

For an appetizer we ordered hush puppies - they were OK, not anything special. The same goes for our meals. I was unimpressed with my steak as was my boyfriend with his fish and chips. The food was terrible but it wasn't worth the price."
__label__3	They did a great job of actually cleaning my car and I would definitely use them again-if I could get an appointment! The customer service of the scheduler is pretty awful. She is consistently rude and obviously annoyed on the phone, that is if you can get them to even answer. Been trying to make an appointment for so long my groupon expired.
__label__3	This hotel is ok. Area not great, but it is by an airport so...rooms wee clean, I hate the breakfast set up. Nothing included.  People were friendly, and there is a WAWA down the road bonus!  I wouldn't vacation here, but it does the job for a quick stay.
__label__3	I went to my best friend's wedding here. The venue was really pretty and nice. Everything looked beautiful. The appetizers were so good! The dinner food though not so much. The buffet line went fast.
__label__3	Great service and atmosphere, however the entertainment lately has been really off putting. We liked it before all the live acts came on. It's quite frankly, awkward!
__label__3	Beautiful inside. Great service. Food was very good but the portions on some items a bit small and pricey.
__label__3	A high end, high priced Chinese/Asian fusion import from Center City. Certainly more convenient than having to drive to the city, but worth the price?  Jury's still out for me....
__label__3	"Unless I get Jackie or Cindy I'm always disappointed. Long wait times and iffy customer service don't help. Kinda hard to see in the picture but the painting was uneven, not impressed for 31 dollars for a simple pedi 
Three stars because the tech was nice but not very skilled, if they can't do a simple pedicure I'd hate to think what would happen if I wanted some more adventurous"
__label__3	Must eat outside! Not aware of that. Food was good. Churros great!!!! Best I ever had.
__label__3	"Came here for dinner with a group of friends. 

The steak itself deserves only 2 stars. I asked for medium rare, but apparently it came out as medium well done. It didn't taste good as a medium well steak either. 

However the appetizer and the drinks were quite good, hence comes the third star."
__label__3	Well, the food is good and the prices are very reasonable, the just need to clean up their act a little - meaning, tidy up the place. You might not expect a great eggs Benedict at a local diner but theirs was very tasty. Eggs were cooked just right with an ample amount of ham. Home fries are tasty, too, Again, good food - especially for the price, but they just need to make the place a little cleaner. Will try again in a month or so.
__label__3	This is a neat restaurant with branding on the walls. Lunch specials are generally quick.  The mini chimi lunch special is a great price and perfect serving size.  Nicest thing is they happily will give you your drink in a to- go cup :)
__label__3	We went to Cavan with a group of 9 on a Saturday. Food was pretty good. The pork chop and quail were delicious. The scallops came out cold. One of the pork chops that my friend ordered was undercooked. We had server named Emma who  was really sweet and went out of her way to split the tab into 4 at the end of the meal. But, the biggest disappointment was how long it took for our meal. 8:00 reservation and we were served at 10:15 ish.
__label__3	More times than not they don't have what I need.  There is another Home Depot in the area that seems to have stuff this one doesn't.  Why is that?
__label__3	"S&S brings back memories from those long college nights.

Service: 2/5
Food: 3/5

Service was slow to get to us but all too quick to give us the bill. Five minutes just to get water, 10 minutes for our orders, 17 minutes to get our sandwiches, and eighteen minutes to receive the bill."
__label__3	I like the coffee and the ambience. The shop is directly across from the freeway so the view is not much to look at. Most regrettable is the slow internet connection. I would come more often but the wifi is too slow for me to work.
__label__3	It was crowded during lunchtime which is a good sign & service was pretty good. Food was good, but pricey for what is was, basic Mexican food. I would have given it more stars if the portions were so small & the price so high. You get spoiled with true Mexican owned & operated places w/ old family recipes or even Baja Fresh in some cities, where the cost is lower & yet the food is fresh & affordable. Guacamole was good. If your craving Mexican food, in the area & wanna drop a dime, this is your place.
__label__3	Beautiful location, very romantic, and fabulous service... only reason I can't give 5 stars is because it was overpriced for the quality of food. We had a filet, lamb, an appetizer and spent over $300 and the meals didn't wow us.
__label__3	Went here after shopping and we thgt we would get food and a couple of drinks to round out the day. We sat at a table and the service was a little slow maybe because Sunday is the only excuse I can see. We ordered a bucket of beer and a couple of pickle shots to watch the football game. The pickle shots were AWESOME!!  We were going to order food but it was sooooo Smokey in there my eyes were burning. So we finished our bucket and went down to Tony's. Nice place but the smoking is ridiculous that's why 2 stars.
__label__3	Without the ambiance of State St (read: fun drunk people) this place is pretty depressing. Its basically just an open kitchen and half a bar and totally dead. The only sounds you hear are the loud fridge. They only have 4 beers on tap now, which I remember being much more. Food is better when there are other people around enjoying it and on this Friday night it was completely dead. The pulled pork was decent and we appreciated that there was a chicken salad option. Overall the experience was awkward and disappointing. Something went wrong here.
__label__3	It's ok. Small servings of protein. It served it's purpose for today, but I won't be back.
__label__3	"my portabella mushroom sandwich was yum!
but the thing that lost big points was my friend's mystery sauce that came with her burger and fries. It seriously tasted like old dish rags. I wanted to puke. 
I wished they had put the mushroom in the middle of the pepper and lettuce to keep my bread from getting soggy. I also had the watermelon salad.  it was interesting, but the watermelons were too ripe and mushy."
__label__3	Fun place to go with a group, very fun atmosphere. Food was good , great bourbon selection as you might expect by its name. Parking is a pain.
__label__3	"It's nice to have an all veg/vegan place nearby! I do, however, think they should stay out of the walk up ""to go"" arena. Waiting for food is painfully slow. it is very awkward because there is no designated seating for to go customers so you are just standing in the middle of the restaurant holding your metal number sign. It might be a more enjoyable experience if you go in planning to eat your meal there."
__label__3	The pizza here is pretty good when you're in the mood for it, but definitely par for the course, and not even close to that of its nearby neighbor, Dewey's.  We came here a few weeks ago and I ordered a slice of the tomato basil, which wasn't as tasty as my boyfriend's choice of sausage and veggies.  You can order this by the slice or the pie, but I think it's pretty pricey by the slice.  I'd rather pay just as much for a Green Lantern at Dewey's.
__label__3	"Good quick hitter spot to grab lunch or dinner.

Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch is a local legend - a popular spot. They even have this awesome commercial: 
https://vimeo.com/26560931

The chicken plate is where it's at. Tri-tip in theory is amazing but I think the chicken here is a lot better. Very good flavor, you will want to just eat the skin it's so good. The beans and rice are clutch - not overly prepared. 

Tortillas and salsa are underwhelming but you shouldn't come here for those."
__label__3	I had the Obon Ramen. It was okay. It really is missing that deep savory flavor that great ramen has. The egg was too runny. The texture of the noodles weren't bad though. My server was awful. The sushi guy was really nice though. The sushi was fine nothing fantastic. This restaurant is trendy and cool looking inside but I wouldn't go back due to back service and mediocre food.
__label__3	It's a totally normal McDonald's, but the only annoying this is that there's no lights out of the parking lot, and it's on a busy road, so you're gonna have to wait a while for your left hand turn. Other then that, it's as clean as McDonald's gets! Friendly employees and cheap!
__label__3	"I had the infamous sushiritto. The salmon had a strange taste to it, but I wasn't so scared of getting sick that I stopped eating. It was strange having lettuce in my roll -- I can't say that it added much or that I would get it again. Same goes for the onions. 

Overall the experience was good, the location is cool, but the food wasn't so great. I'll definitely go back again, but but now I'll know better how to customize my order."
__label__3	The beef and cheese empanada is really really good. Kinda greasy but it's comfort food. Other flavors are not bad but beef and cheese is special good. Never busy so super short wait times.
__label__3	"Drinks: ok, a little watered down

Appetizers: pretty good, under seasoned

Entrees: great! simple fare but beautifully prepared

Service: meh. We were rushed and she didn't really want to explain anything

Wouldn't go back any time soon."
__label__3	I guess fast food just isn't my thing. Can determine if the food was good for a Wendy's or just pretty back because it is fast food.
__label__3	A aged and dated hotel, has a strong musty smell, they do work a keeping it clean though. Personnel could use a little pep talk from HR, not a very friendly group. To me it seemed the rooms were missing some of the basics in a hotel room- fridge, microwave. Tv was old but overall, the stay was ok, nothing special
__label__3	Food could have been a little warmer. We ate in and store was freezing.
__label__3	Good food and chocolate fondue but nothing extraordinary. Receptionists are definitely not friendly.  I saw them mocking and making fun of customers.
__label__3	"Oh Bourbon St. This bar has become a favorite of my friends and I. Why you ask? 

Simple. Mondays are $1 domestic drafts. They have a large two story patio where it's great to hang out with friends and drink cheap, non-hoppy beer when the weather is nice. 

The service is slow and the food is typical of a sit down bar. However, Bourbon St is a welcome non-chain, Indy staple."
__label__3	I really like Moe's but sometimes the quality of food is not the same. Sometimes is old and does not taste the way it should. You cannot go wrong when everything is fresh it tastes good. But today was not the case. Also i would like to mention the staff sometimes gives a big portion and sometimes they don't put enough. They have ladle's everything should be measured but still sometimes they don't put enough. I overall like going to Moe's but please try and keep it same.
__label__3	"Good food but this place is just a ""tired"" looking and is dirty.  I hate places that have lots of flies too.  Like I said, food is good but the restaurant area absolutely needs a renovation."
__label__3	Meh, I guess it's all about what you want & proper expectations. This is not fine dining or a trendy establishment. I'd say this is a local retreat from the touristy places nearby. It's a divey sports bar with bar food. I had a BBQ brisket sandwich & fries and it was pretty decent. The most distracting thing was the smoke. I've just gotten so used to non-smoking restaurants, I'm spoiled. But if you're a smoker and looking for a good local sports bar - give it a try.
__label__3	Wow! Got the seafood risotto and it was so salty it was almost inedible! My date had the fillet, which was incredibly tender. Nice job there. Had the calamari and rock shrimp appetizer - so so at best. Service was incredibly polite and helpful but also very slow.
__label__3	I've been here a few times and have never left satisfied. The seafood doesn't seem fresh and the service is sub par.  I won't code to go back. Three are way better sushi places in NOLA.
__label__3	"It has a nice family owned and operated atmosphere. Service was fast and good, but I just wasn't too impressed with the food or the salsa and I typically like most salsas. Their salsa just tasted bland to me and my taco and enchiladas was average. My boyfriend got their popular ""Indian Taco"" and he liked it. I would give it another try, but it's not a Mexican restaurant I would just crave and recommend to people. It's located downtown, so sometimes parking is a little difficult depending on what day and time you go."
__label__3	"(yankee doodl err-body!)
Jim's steak's here are pret-ty good
nothing to write home for 
get the whiz and onions too
provolone's too bland--a bore.
didn't have to wait in line
made me very hap-py
will i come back to this place?
why not it's not that crap-py!"
__label__3	I've gone here several times and really wanted to like it. Sadly, I'm not sure what all the hype is about. The food portions are so big I'm always, but the biggest issue I have is with the burger patty and bun. The patty is an under-seasoned puck of meat and the bun is way too dense. After only eating half of my burger, it the taste begins to feel dull. The only redeeming quality of my meals here were my side of tots.
__label__3	Its a gas station. Ok as gas stations go. Prices aren't terrible, compared to the Shell and Chevron down the road. Easy in/out access off N. Virginia, which is a huge plus. Never been in the little shop, so I can't comment on that one.
__label__3	Went here based on a recommendation from a local hotel.  Was looking for a good Cuban sandwich.  Service was ok, nothing special.  The waitress was around but not very attentive.  I got the Cuban with yellow rice and black beans.  The rice and beans were excellent.  The Cuban forget about it.  It had tomato and lettuce and mayonnaise.  An authentic Cuban sandwich?  Not even close.  I was very disappointed.
__label__3	"Great service and wonderful staff. Our room in the Camellia building was nice. The lobby and restaurants were far away from our room, but the bistro patio had a great ocean view to enjoy a nice glass of wine and take in the view.
One thing that is lacking is outdoor lounging space with firepits or ocean views (We don't want to have to use the pool area). For the price, it needs more ""perks""."
__label__3	I'm a huge sushi lover and have been here twice. I highly suggest ordering the Playboy roll. They bring it to your table and light it on fire so not only is it cool to see, but very tasty! We also ordered the crab rangoon, but they were nothing out of the ordinary. The seating here is not the greatest. Most of the tables are extremely small.
__label__3	Great queso!!!! However, the margaritas were a huge disappointment. $35 for super weak pitchers.
__label__3	Thought this restaurant is seafood only, but found out that it serves steak and pasta. I was happy to know that fish is wild & sustainable, but it's a regular food.
__label__3	People were nice but who gives you a burrito with no rice and beans in it and I payed for grilled onions that I never got! The carne asada had good seasoning but the chicken was too dry. Lots of other people loved but it wasn't for me.
__label__3	They used to be really good, but owners changed several years ago and the service and food has not been as good. Eddies is good for a late night bite paired with heavy drinking and some pool. Other than that, I wouldn't go out of my way for it. The upside is, they have a great dog friendly patio and often they have live music.
__label__3	"Heard about this being the ""go to"" place when in Nashville.  Waited for 45 min with great expectations.  The biscuits were fantastic and the gravy very nice.  Had a moonshine Bloody Mary which was good.  The fried tomato biscuits were also very good.  However portions were disappointing in size.  At the end of the day the food was good. But nothing to write home about.  The service was very attentive and friendly."
__label__3	This location has been here since the early 70's. I remember the action figures ripped-off characters from McDonald's characters they distributed.
__label__3	Service was wonderful! The bottomless mimosas were 80% orange juice so not sure if it was worth it. The buffalo tachos was the highlight of our day!!!
__label__3	Cute dive bar, with nice staff, decent music and good prices. Prime location. Would visit again if in the area!
__label__3	I just love their BBQ chicken pizza with sun-dried tomatoes.  They load it up with the sun-dried tomatoes.
__label__3	This is essentially what you would expect for an all you can eat sushi location.  I have found the cuts better when ordering out.  Hana's is better for Sushi nearby - no question;however, it is pricier - you get what you pay for IMO
__label__3	Decent food at a very fair price. Nothing really outstanding,but consistently good. Lunch and dinner specials are where it's at.
__label__3	This is a decent pizza place but there are definitely better options in Nashville. The dough was great, sauce could've been better. Offering a Greek salad, you would think they would have Greek dressing to go with it, but your closest option is Italian. Now, as far as desserts go, it was the worst tiramisu I have ever had in my life, nothing about it was made properly and it is the reason I'm giving them 3 stars instead of 4. My friend had the cannoli and that was much better.
__label__3	"On a Mission to move mediocre Mexican.

Will some rich Kirkwoodian give some real Mexicans a restaurant so we can eat the good stuff? Like Tacos and Ice Cream Joint or any of the other legit good ones?"
__label__3	Very very nice waitstaff.  You feel like you're family. This is a cute little place, has HUGE portions, and the food is very good.
__label__3	Very nice staff but I had a Bloody Mary and I'm not a fan. It wasn't spicy and tasted watered down. :( The pickled green beans were good but that's bout it. Sad day
__label__3	The ladies at this Walgreens photo service center are very kind, patient, honest, and remember you.  There setup is typical, but they actually know how to work the machines and will help you with any customizing you need.  The store is clean.  I've never gotten a script here so I cannot comment on that.  They are open 24 hours but the photo center closes early.
__label__3	King crab legs only come w four little legs and doesn't even come with any potato's or corn. Customer service is good. Atmosphere is good, price point is high. Crawfish is good. When u order the crawfish plate it comes w corn and potatoes unlike the crab legs that I expected to b much bigger. You also can't mix and match your sauces . I wanted butter garlic and Cajun but u can only get one. Disappointing
__label__3	"This is exactly what you would think it would be -- a semi-ghetto, hoosier Chinese buffet. 

That said, the food was decent and actually everything I had was tasty. But I can't vouch for the cleanliness or anything. Plus, they have the usual random offerings like ice cream and chicken fingers...WTF?"
__label__3	Now latitudes. Nothing stand out about the food. Drinks are expensive. Atmosphere OK, I guess I was expecting more.
__label__3	As a broke college student, this works for me. However, I wish I could attach a screenshot of how long I've held just to talk to a customer service rep. 1 WHOLE HOUR and counting...
__label__3	This location has come a long way since opening. The breads are fresh, and they do not skimp on toppings. They still occasionally have a problem with the online ordering and starting the order for pickup, but the place is very much improved.
__label__3	"I wished I could have tried more at Chhaya, and will hopefully return -- but I was sad to find that they stop serving food at 3 (because no one eats after 3?) so I was left to get a limeade ... and they were out of it ... but the raspberry lemonade was really quite good. The place has a bit of a ""cooler than you"" vibe that I'm not really into, but I could see how it may be nice if you have time to chill and stay there for a while. I'll likely try it again."
__label__3	Farm to mall to table. Went for the grilled chicken sandwich. It was flavorful but at this price point the piece of chicken was too small. C'mon guys, thus isn't wagyu beef! Really enjoyed the fountain beverage selection. Good iced teas that aren't too sweet. Service is reasonably fast. Next time I'll try the burger. One of my work colleagues said it was very good. Recommend but did not wow me.
__label__3	I really want to give y'all 5 stars but there are two things that need to be replaced. One is consistency on burrito size. One day it's normal size and the next it's very skimpy. The only thing which is what really bothers me are giving out two small hot sauces. Please fix and I'll be more than happy to give y'all 5 stars
__label__3	"I may have been lame in what I ordered but wasn't blown away. It was average at best. I ordered the house salad that wasn't that great and the pad Thai that didn't have a good peanut flavor that I like and expect from a pad thai. I'm glad I added broccoli to give it some flavor. 

I'm not an experienced Thai food guy so didn't get adventurous so take my review for what it is. I was hoping for sushi based on the pictures but they don't serve it anymore."
__label__3	"Was hoping for an awesome, new Mexican spot but wasn't overly impressed. The restaurant itself is nicely designed & looks modern, cool w an outside seating area & gorge bar but the menu was boring & the food items had very little flavor and/or I paid too much for too little. My sister really liked her burrito & said it tasted ""healthy"" but my son & I were not as satisfied."
__label__3	"If you go, order a burger. My wife and daughters ordered chicken tenders, hot dogs, seafood burgers, etc. They were very unremarkable. If there is ""burger"" on the sign chances are...  Anyway, decent burger. Not the best or worst if this crowded field. I think this category is getting watered down."
__label__3	This location is right next to an Ollie's discount store which may put some restaurant-goers off initially, however, this is a hidden gem!  There were plenty of vegetarian options which I appreciated! Likewise, the food was pretty good.  Likewise, the prices were very reasonable for a family to be able to go out to eat.  It is a fairly standard eatery with no-frills, so if you are looking for ambiance in your dining experience, this may not be your location.
__label__3	Either very friendly and good service or extremely rude , just depends who's in there serving you .
__label__3	Sorry Nashville! This place is waaayyyyy overrated! The chicken meatball ramen was solid, but everything else was just alright.
__label__3	"This is a nice, new gym in Hendersonville. The parking is absolutely ridiculous, so good luck with that. 
Friendly staff, childcare play room, clean, and nice equipment. Although, for being so new I was surprised at how many treadmills were not working. Also, they have a movie cinema where you can workout and watch a movie on a giant screen. The Hendersonville locations cinema room is not as big or as nice as the location in Murfreesboro, but it's still a nice feature."
__label__3	They had a fair selection of kitchen things. My wife and I browsed their selection and got a cookie cutter out of their large selection. Probably not a place I will shop from regularly since prices were probably slightly more than online, but it was fun browsing through the store.
__label__3	Very large selection of sporting goods - heavy emphasis on fishing and hunting. Large selection of Saints and LSU stuff, but mostly lower quality materials. Good place to get a bike for the kids; large well priced selection on athletic shoes. Surprisingly large selection of grills (both charcoal and gas) along with every possible add on for grilling. Employees are difficult to get help from and usually stay by the registers. If you need help in the back of the store it can be hard. Prices are good but quality is a little low-end overall.
__label__3	They have all the ingredients for a great restaurant: location, decor, nice bar, good service. But the food is meh. Fish slightly overcooked... not inedible but could have been much tastier. Cocktail specialties also meh.
__label__3	"The ShopRite on 45 is the worst! The flow thru the produce section is horrible; all of the aisles are too narrow so there are always traffic jams no matter what time of day you go. They won't accept the shopper number on a third party app so you're forced to carry the card or download their app. The hoagie rolls are very dry and crumbly. 
The people stocking shelves are always blocking the aisles. Even the outside cart machine was blocking the fire lane.  I always feel stressed when leaving this store."
__label__3	"This place has been an institution in Tampa for years.  Great breakfast with fresh ingredients.  The girls wre excited about egg whites and a chocolate chip pancake that was big enough to throw as a frisbee.

Fruit was a solid call - bowl of strawberries, fresh cut pineapple, and honeydew melon.  Omlette was good, but a bit small.  Multi-grain pancakes didn't really distiguish themselves from normal pancakes, and It looked like we landed the one uniformed server of the bunch."
__label__3	"Loved the refreshing cool air as soon as you walk in. This heat and humidity man! So it was much needed relief and the museum is free which is even better. 

I loved seeing some of the old minting equipment and the opportunity to be in the building. 

However, I was very disappointed that there was so few exhibits, pieces and information. 

I think it only took about 15 minutes to tour the entire place. The third floor only had a couple items to look at!"
__label__3	When it comes to buy groceries or over the counter medicine, the service is ok BUT for window pick up (prescriptions) they are really SLOOOOOW and not very nice!
__label__3	Just ordered a small pie plus a turkey club.  Pie was good. Got the order right when they said it would arrive  and it was hot and yummy..  Also ordered turkey club, my favorite sandwich which was a disappointment. It was not fresh turkey, but lunch meat turkey roll that was very salty. Had to dump it, so that was bucks down the drain, and during quarantine, throwing away money, hurt.  As other reviews said, the fries were good. So mixed review.
__label__3	I visited local deli after years of eating at Chris Deli.  The service was fine but the food wasn't as good.  I ordered the same items and it was not the same.  I was disappointed I probably won't be going back.
__label__3	Good pizza if you're already in Manayunk, but I don't think I'll be leaving Center City for Couch Tomato.  Rustica and NYPD Pizza are just more convenient.
__label__3	This place is in a fabulous location. Being beside the courthouse means you get watch wedding processions New Orleans style, band and all, as you sit having your dinner. I had the shrimp and tortellini which was good. The sauce was flavorful and the pasta and shrimp was cooked well. I loved the ambiance but the food quality and price give it just three stars for me. Enjoy!
__label__3	Solid burger option in reading terminal for people in conferences nearby. Nite my first choice in the terminal, but a good options when lines are to long elsewhere.
__label__3	With so many places to eat tacos on Nolensville, the tacos at Taqueria Express didn't stand out to me. They were fine (the lengua was a little gristly, and the carne asada was okay), but the wait for the tacos was longer than I typically expect for a taco truck. Definitely okay - not a bad meal. It just isn't a truck I'd go back to necessarily.
__label__3	"Three and a half stars. The chef's sushi lunch special is a great deal. Miso soup, salad, and assorted sushi for under $11. 

The place has all the ambiance of a hotel restaurant, which is to say very little at all. And the host kept calling me sweetheart which really grates. But my server was a pleasant, helpful guy."
__label__3	Seems my pedicure did not go as planned -- the 2nd time did not prove to be as nice as the first. they are very nice people, maybe the woman that worked with me just wasn't experienced or didn't know -- but OUCH
__label__3	been here once only. ok for its purposes. Nice selction of wines. Loving the outdoor seating.
__label__3	I'm reluctantly going with 3 stars as the service was very good, and they have Carta Blanca beer, served ice-cold, a rarity in the Boise area.  But the food is just typical McMexican - nothing to distinguish it from 90% of the other Mexican restaurants in the area.
__label__3	The first time I came here I thought it was great. The second time was just okay. I think it's a little overpriced for what you get and you are paying for the vibe of the place. Drinks at the bars are great though!
__label__3	Expect the fact that inside the casino is pricey but their food should exceed far expectations and I didn't think my experience was phenomenal. I won't go back and eat to this restaurant again
__label__3	Visiting from Houston, so we decided to stop by and get some good ol' Nola food. I got the rosemary shrimp po boy. It was a huge entree, definitely a filler. The French bread was a bit too hard though, each bite fell like my gums were being sliced. But OVERALL, the food was good. Mom got the small gumbo soup, she enjoyed it, tried it myself and nothing to write home about, but it was decent. Would definitely like to try their other stuff. Service was good, the place was so small so I believe they were running on one server.
__label__3	Place looks nice. Didn't have enough options on the menu to choose from. Tea was good. Overall it was ok.
__label__3	One of the better sushi restaurants we've tried in Indy.  Fish is fresh.  Don't expect too many special or exotic rolls and you'll be happy with your visit.
__label__3	The chicken stack was pretty good, the beefy biscuits were expensive for what you got - tiny and bland. The atmosphere is hipster cool but a little loud. The coffee was excellent. The next table got a bacon  burger that looked delicious and the Bloody Mary bar was inviting.
__label__3	"I know I know, silly as it seems, I have not had the pizza here!  but I did get a tortilla soup and 1/2 a Mediterranean salad.  The soup was really yummy with a sprinkle of cilantro and avocado on top.  

the salad was more ""eh"", I think the dressing that comes with it is too salty.  

But I am looking to go back for the pizza!  Hopefully they can make a cheese-less one!"
__label__3	Pizza was really good. But.. I went on a Monday night and the music was too loud it was difficult to hear the workers asking what I wanted on my pizza. Also I'm not sure why they asked me what toppings I wanted because I had ordered a signature pizza that comes with the toppings spelled out on the sign.  Unnecessary and confusing extra step. They were out of Parmesan cheese. Tables were dirty.  Subpar customer service. I would probably go back for the pizza though.
__label__3	Typical greasy spoon diner. Small but good atmosphere. The food is a tad expensive for what it is but you are paying for the convenience of stumbling in drunk after a night a partying.
__label__3	"First time visit. Arrived 10 minutes after opening. There was already a line to order. And a line quickly grew behind. I  BBQ. The garlic Mac & cheese was great. The bbq beans were fantastic. Couldn't wait to try the pulled pork. It arrived without bbq sauce. There were 3 sauces to choose from. I selected the ""house"" flavor. I eventually tried all 3. For my taste, all were too liquidy. And lacking a robust flavor. Even though the sides were delicious, the meat was lacking"
__label__3	"Love the dive scene, club sandwich, bacon and waffle (had a clover imprint in the waffle) were all pretty good but the burger was awful. Awful, don't even wanna know what kind of meat it's made from.

Waiter and cook were awesome, will go again but will skip the burger."
__label__3	I have been going to the MH since I was a young girl and although much has changed through out the years the food still remains delicious. I recommend the Beijing Duck! Words cannot describe how succulent and amazing this duck is. I recommend sharing with at least two others because after all sharing is caring but idk too many people who would eat that many steamed buns and a whole duck. But I must say the service has changed that is why they get 3 out 5 stars.the manager was quick to fix the issue and handled it very respectfully and professionally. Please try this place it's awesome.
__label__3	I've heard wonderful reviews about Campbell's Dairyland so I figured we were obviously missing out on something spectacular. I was wrong, the food was subpar and the service was horrible. Lisa was our server and she wasn't friendly to say the least. I usually prefer to shop at locally owned establishments but next time we'll go to DQ.
__label__3	"I've visited this coffee shop a few times and it's not my favorite in Germantown. I had the pour over coffee and it was fine. I've been told the Vietnamese iced coffee was really good. 

The reason for three stars is that I didn't find the staff super helpful and the music is so loud that one is not able to use this coffee shop as a work place. Also, there aren't prices on the chocolates on the counter and I purchased one- it was $10- for a piece of CANDY."
__label__3	The hotel was older and not in the greatest shape. Overall the price was good for the quality of our stay. The front desk staff was very nice to myself and my son at check in. Parking was pricey as are most in the city.
__label__3	I happened to be in the downtown area and decided to have lunch here.  The service was swift and all of the ingredients were fresh.  I kept it simple and just had the Mongolian Beef with steamed rice.  While this isn't the best that I've had.  It is decent.  The portion sizes were just right.
__label__3	"I used to rate Zookers as fair to middling--and that was when I was feeling generous. 

But last time I went back and I was really impressed.  I had a delicious ahi, and my entire table greatly enjoyed their meals.  Very good service too.

I'd give it more stars but the prices are a little on the steep side."
__label__3	"I tried this place while traveling for work. It has 2 levels which is nice if there are several sports games on, so you can choose which game/event sounds you want to see. I had the buffalo chicken wrap is a pretty standard. 

To call this place a gastropub is a bit of a stretch. Yes they serve food, but standard pub fare. No 'gastro' items. And the drinks are standard fare as well... Unless you want to try the $3 mystery beer."
__label__3	Eh, average...2.5 stars really. I stopped by in dire need of a pedicure. They were quick but didn't take enough time to scrub down my calluses, so my feet didn't feel as fresh walking out of there as they usually do after a pedicure. The pedicure is $25, but the mani/pedi is only $32, so if I return in the future (out of geographic convenience) I'll get the mani/pedi to feel like I'm getting a good value.
__label__3	Great pizza, however the pies are very small.  Each pizza is basically for one person at $14 a piece.  The hostess was very unfriendly and did not speak to us. She just grabbed menus and walked away,  we followed hoping that's what we where supposed to do. We where seated at a very small table in the corner, extremely close to another family, even though the restaurant was empty.  Like I said pizza was good but I don't think that we will be back.
__label__3	"Plus: One of the few places in the city to offer karaoke rooms!
Minus: Doing karaoke isn't as fun when you know the people in the room, and the graphics on the tv on STRANGE!!! But I digress.
Double minus: I threw my fedora into the crowd and knocked a SUPER expensive drink over...and graciously bought said person another drink.

I don't eat sushi, so I can't comment on that, but if you're looking to rent a karaoke room for a night, definitely check this spot out."
__label__3	A nicely decorated place inside and outside. Service is nice but slow. Dishes are of good quality but a little over-priced.
__label__3	"Food is great but you need to beware of the upsell. Some of their additions are almost as much as the meal. When my friend brought that up, the overall vibe was ""oh well"" sorry. This was my first time here  and I probably won't bother to make the trip back after seeing how my friends issue was handled. Too bad....she's the one who was raving about this place."
__label__3	Cruise is nice but food is cafeteria like. If u r good with that go for it otherwise just take the cruise
__label__3	"I haven't been to this place in 5 years.  Why, you ask?  Because I am OLD.  Over 30 is apparently elderly at Plough, and I felt out of place among the inebriated youngins'.

So although it is no longer my scene, I spent many a college and young adult weekend nights here, and it seems the place has not changed in the last 10 yrs.  They always play good music, so no matter what decade you were born in, if you are just drunk enough, it'll be a good time."
__label__3	"New Theatre, people are friendly, and I like when the theatre's crowded as long as people aren't checking their blackberry during the movie.  You get that sometimes here :(, 

usually it's not too busy except the weekends, which is nice also.  i've sat in here by myself on occasions."
__label__3	It's great, don't get my wrong, but it's SO expensive it almost doesn't make sense.  They're making homemade style Israeli dishes that most households make for under $10 a portion so to dine in and eat vegetable salads and grilled meat and clock in at like $150 is a bit absurd to me.  Love the food though.  I am glad I went because the experience was great, but I will never be able to make this place a regular event.
__label__3	"We ordered a large garden salad...not nearly as generous as described. Restaurant was really busy and we only could sit at a dirty table. Waitresses all but one looked miserable. We both got 12 oz NY strips...really just fine and loaded baked a treat.
They forgot our salad at first but remembered later.
Our dinner with tip was over 60.00. Dont know if we will do this again"
__label__3	Went for Sunday brunch and the service was great. However, we had no idea it was just buffet and were given no menus. We were shocked when the bill came. The food was good, but not $100 good for two adults and a child. The buffet was $28 and the drinks were WAY overpriced. $8 for half cup of juice and $7 for a double shot of espresso. We will probably not go back again.
__label__3	"Always enjoy the food but
this time the Hostess was so rude
She made a comment that she hates it when someone pay cash
Never experienced anything like that makes us not want to come back."
__label__3	Tried to go on Wednesday morning with my wife before she went into work but this place was not open during their posted hours with no signs or explanations. Had to scramble for plan B and ended up at Viva Burrito (which was good). I think this will only be my Plan A now if I call in the order ahead of time to make sure they are open.
__label__3	This place is kinda hit or miss. We've been here about 3 times and each time both service and food have varied between good and just okay. I wouldn't drive out of my way to eat here but if I'm in the area and hungry I'd consider eating here again.
__label__3	always reliable... good, warm drinks, really nice staff, HUGE cafe, good place to study or read :)
__label__3	I order here a good bit and typically its good.  Lo mein is great, the crab rangoons not so much.  Very little filling.  The last lo mein I ordered was way too salty, but usually its good.  Not the best in the city but good.
__label__3	"The pizza was fantastic! But we were told that they had a buffet. It wasn't what I was expecting at all. They had a salad station and the two small pizzas that were under the heat lamp could have been there for quite a while. My wife and I would like to return but we will not be having their so called ""buffet"". The server was really nice but for the place being almost empty, she was pretty slow. We do like the pizza though so we will be back and maybe even try their takeout and delivery."
__label__3	Expired items, lack of items, and awful fried chicken! I had some issues with expired items and it was handled by Joe, so the extra star is for that. A 3rd star is for being open 24 hrs. I sure do miss living close to their Glenolden location; their fried chicken was succulent and I never picked up expired items and AAAAAND they were never out of blueberries!
__label__3	Acceptable off the highway barbecue. Expected a bit more from the reviews - but I definitely agree that the brisket is a no go... My boyfriend said it smelled and tasted like tuna. Mac and cheese, chicken, and pulled pork was all good, and tasted as it should. Very fast and prompt service!
__label__3	"Lunch buffet was $9.99 and included many meat choices and starches. I especially liked the smoked chicken, curry goat, mac and cheese and  patties. I wish they would have had a dessert.  I'll be back to catch the buffet. 

Downside,  service is a bit slow and we had to wait a while to get a waiter to take our money."
__label__3	Very disappointing: in a less than clean area of town. Food maybe 4, but no alcohol licence.
__label__3	Good atmosphere. The food could be better. The beers are fairly tasty. Have been a few times but have had better beer elsewhere.
__label__3	"Food is good, healthy. I'm not a fan of their aggressive tip technique. When you pay they spin their screen around to give you the ""opportunity"" to auto-tip them 15%  20% or 25%. This is before you've experienced their food or their service. (Which is limited to running food). I'd give the food 4 stars but that pushiness made me lose my appetite for Taziki's."
__label__3	Landesuntypisch lahme Bedienung. Etwas arrogant und unfreundlich. Essen gewohnt gut.
__label__3	Shopping here is great. Easy in and easy out unless I need something. This is where everything is hit or miss. It used to be that if you needed anything, you had experts waiting to help you on your projects. Nowadays it's just college kids or high schools drop outs that don't know anything. If you ask them where something is, they have to look it up or ask another associate that's older than them (I mean more knowledgeable). Good news is that although they may be clueless, they are nice and helpful.
__label__3	I really wish I could give a good review, but my Oak Street Breakfast--eggs, grits, biscuits and gravy, and bacon-- were cold. The flavor was there, but cold food and watered down coffee do not impress me.
__label__3	"Food was good, way over priced for the quality. We started with a wedge salad and it was the size of an orange. Tiny!
The filet was average. We also had the special, Blackened Swordfish which was good. 
The deserts were good.
Four 4 people after only having one round of drinks it was $290. Very expensive."
__label__3	A tired restaurant past its prime. One of the first restaurants of its genre, but much of the Vietnam expatriote population is now in greener western Nashville nabes with fresh eating choices. It is an okay second choice for folks in that environ.
__label__3	This place is pretty famous in the Lansdale area. Pizza is a little above average in terms of flavor. However, the service at the front desk is extremely unpleasant. No customer service whatsoever. As I have only gone for take-out I do not expect much in terms of service but the times I have been there the girls behind the counter do not greet or acknowledge the customers and just about mutter a word to tell you what your bill is. I prefer Vinny's pizza down then road where food is good and you can always get friendly service. Therefore I do not plan to rerun to Giuseppe's.
__label__3	Mediocre food but great location and friendly service. Looks 5x more legit than it actually was, not as good as major chains which is kind of sad.
__label__3	"We were there on Friday night.  There were only 4 occupied tables.  Food are a little above average but pricey.  Most decent entrees are priced close to $20.  No one greeted us at the door.  So, we walked to a table.  A waitress ran to us!  Instead of asking ""how many people"",  she said ""may I help you""!  The man who appears to be the owner giggled!  For this, we would give this restaurant a one-star rating!"
__label__3	Yiayia's was pretty good overall. Interesting to see they still had their valentines decorations up in first week of march but didn't bother me. Had a good selection to choose from. Staff wasn't bad. Not the best service ever but wasn't too bad. Nothing blew me away so that's why I give A-OK.
__label__3	Was referred to this place by a local. The location is large and has a cute outdoor garden. The food was good but not great. We had the red bean and rice with sausage which was good. The muffalata sandwich was very good. The jambalaya was good but too spicy for my taste.
__label__3	Plusses: nice crispy, skinny fries and delicious frozen custard. Minuses: thin crispy burgers. The flavor is pretty good,  but I like thick burgers. If you are like me,  don't go here for lunch,  go here for dessert. The menu is mostly burgers. The service is phenomenal!
__label__3	I'm actually sad...this place came highly recommended! I'm a southern transplant in PA and perhaps my expectations are different. The Mac & cheese was a dry mess, the brisket was not juicy or tender, and the cornbread was 2 slabs of dense cake. My teen son did like his burger but...I feel like I overpaid for an underwhelming food experience. I'll stick to having my daddy fix me some proper BBQ when I visit home.
__label__3	"I already miss the days when SWA's planes had the vacant middle seat. Boarding and deplaning was faster, and no getting chummy with strangers. No more. The flight attendant on my last flight said as much during his preflight PA, ""This is a completely full flight. No empty seats. We lost a lot of money during the past year and we got to start making it up."" I appreciate the honesty."
__label__3	I love Marshall's, but this is probably my least favorite location.  it's smaller than the Elmwood one and sometimes I have gone in and the racks look bare in several sections like they were a few days ago.  I still go if I'm over there, but it isn't my first choice.
__label__3	Cool looking place but not the best service. Not sure if they were just understaffed on a Friday night or what but it really was not busy enough for the speed of service. Also, seemed like a lot of young kids running around without supervision.
__label__3	Coops was alright.  Nothing great.  Had the rabbit and sausage Jambalaya and the blackened chicken sandwich.  The food wasn't that great but it was reasonably priced and the Abita beers were $4.  Probably wouldn't go back again
__label__3	I came here this past summer with a local friend while working in Tampa for the week. The location is great - we had a table with a view of the water and then ventured to the outdoor tiki bar after dinner. The service was good, nothing over the top but good. The food was the same - good, no complaints. I had the coconut shrimp as an app and then the shrimp and crab louie salad for my dinner. The salad was loaded with ingredients that all went well together. I would come back here again if I were in Tampa. Nothing stood out besides the location, but nothing was bad either.
__label__3	Cool spot really good mules and fresh drinks pretty good beer selection. I went earlier in the evening to beat the friday night party crowd and glad i did. I got pretty good service and heard some really good music from 70s to 90s rap. The place is nice and i had fun. Im not a big clubby party guy so if you are come later on it looks ok, but if you're like me come early beat the rush and chill with some drinks and good music
__label__3	"Good seafood and an excellent wait staff. I ate here on a Wednesday and it was filled with a lot of the ""old guard"" of Rittenhouse Square. Atmosphere is exciting, especially if you eat outside."
__label__3	General Tso's chicken and orange beef were good. Lunch specials are ok. Crab Rangoon was kind of gross. There was too much rubbery dough. Service is good though and parking isn't difficult.
__label__3	Food is average, service is below average. I ordered through Grubhub, arrived after being notified that my order was ready for pickup. When I arrived they told me my order was not ready yet, so I waited about 10 minutes longer. When I asked them how much longer they checked and found that my order was not even started. There was a disconnect between Grubhub and their system. No one apologized or even acted like anything was wrong.
__label__3	Was a place to fix my phone when I opted out of my provider's insurance program. Costly but a cheaper option then buying a new phone....
__label__3	Ok. Atmosphere great. Little Italy I can see. Staff friendly. Yes indeed. Bread...slice like a grocery store. Not yummy rolls or baguettes. Calamari sautéed lemon sauce was under seasoned. Linguine fra diablo style...two pieces of good fish but the rest was mashed up for a baby. Carbonara was excellent. Creamy rich. Spilt amongst two would be better. Tiramisu was Light and airy. Wish I could give better.
__label__3	It's an OK beach.  If you are into tidepooling, the tidepools are decent, but you have to time your visit just right with the current tide schedule.  If you go at any time other than the lowest tide point, a lot of the good stuff is underwater.
__label__3	Very long lines and no place to just drop off a package. Had to wait in said line for no reason!
__label__3	"I had an $7 Old fashioned here while hanging with friends. Is it normal to have a cherry in it (google says yes)? I can't remember a time when I've had a cherry in an old fashioned.

This place is split up between being a pub and restaurant. We were on the pub side which has a bar, a few tables, and 4 pool tables and a dart board.

Not much else to say as the place was kinda empty as people were elsewhere watching the Mayweather vs Mcgregor fight. (we watched it at our table on a phone)."
__label__3	"I saw this restaurant on the center city restaurant week menu but we couldn't make it.

We decided to go a few weeks later and found the ambiance to be very nice and it was full of happy guests.

We had the chicken and braised short rib. Both were good, but I found them to be missing seasoning (salt, pepper, etc.)."
__label__3	Good service...no hustle on female customers, I know my cars so no real problem,but cost is good and overall knowledgeable mechanics and assistants. Being a service member its great that they offer discounts for our armed services members so that's a big plus.
__label__3	"truffles fries were crispy, oily, and yummy.
burgers were huge.  good for late nights."
__label__3	I've been here multiple times now hoping to love it, and have to say I never had.  Very cool concept and the interior has a great atmosphere with the decor and showing room in the back being a very unique concept. I can't say anything bad but can't really say anything great either. The food and cocktails are good, but not always my taste, and even after multiple attempts at the menu with friends I haven't found anything I love. I had good times with friends and would come back for drinks to enjoy the atmosphere as well as the screening room.
__label__3	I'm not exactly sure why this place has such high ratings. Our waiter was very nice and decor is interesting; however, the food and cocktails were at best: mediocre. The quality of food was average and the temperature of the food was lukewarm. This place is cute, but if you're looking for good food rather than just ambiance, go elsewhere.
__label__3	"Its ok, they charge an arm and a leg for a small 8oz  ""fresh squeezed orange juice"" their food is pretty good.  Its nothing spectacular but its better then IHOP.  Don't come here on weekends, its packed to the brim and the wait is easily 1hr.  It is best that Indy has to offer."
__label__3	It's OK, service is actually pretty good foods extremely salty. But who doesn't love having peanuts at your table to eat the whole time you're there.
__label__3	I've been here twice and both times my server was really nice and attentive, but the food took forever to come out (30 mins+). I will say the chicken with green chili and cheese on top is delicious and the portions are huge!!
__label__3	My Eye Round and Tendon Pho was mediocre. There was too much fat on the meat and the broth was nothing to write home about. The service was bad too. We couldn't get extra napkins for half an hour.
__label__3	"My sister and I stopped in here yesterday to window shop. We came across a specific shampoo behind the counter marked as 8.99. Once we purchased it, it came out  be 16.99:/. We called them out on it Andy said they wouldn't honor the price listed IN THE GLASS. We decided not to argue with her later to see that she found us in the parking lot to apologize. She called the ""other store"" to confirm. It could be a little more professional or my liking, but I don't expect to much because of the area.."
__label__3	This place is pretty much still the same except the ownership has changed slightly(I think one of the kids is running it now) and one very important thing has suffered: POTATO PANCAKES! WHY?!?! They are like, well, actual pancakes now and that is not good in the world of German potato pancakes. Please bring back the greasy, crispy delicious! Please? Otherwise...still a neat place to visit. Mini whine fest over.
__label__3	Went back for lunch.their address is kinda weird.doesn't show exactly where it's supposed to be.anyways..called ahead and ordered before we got there so the food was ready when we get there.awesome!not the best thai food .and the service is alittle toooo slow.but they have less customer than other thai places during lunch time just fyi.
__label__3	"We visited this place after a friend we are visiting said this is the oldest icecream place in the city. The place is nice and has a good antique look to it. They have a wide variety unique ice cream flavors and server big portions that justify the price.

We ordered a scoop of Coffee ice cream and a broken hearts sundae. Both of them were nice but nothing exceptional and I would like to only go back for the ambience if not for the waitress being rude and asking us to stand in the cold when there is lot of empty space in the bake."
__label__3	"Long trip from Brooklyn NY, to find out this place was more of a big media trap than a great tasty steak sandwich. The meat was dry I had to add ketchup to it. Usually a Philly cheese steak is juicy with peppers onions and cheese! This place is missing the basics. I can make a better one on my own! 

The cheese fries were good. 

I wish i read the reviews before I drove there.

The best part of this place is that the service is fast, fast enough to taste my sad sandwich."
__label__3	"Just okay, fast delivery. We ordered a lot of food, one dish being ""Lobster Chow Mein"" but it was obviously crawfish and not lobster. Don't know if this is a translation issue or what."
__label__3	Usually a great experience at Firehouse Subs!   Service was great, but unlike most times, the meats were pretty skimpy on our large Hero sandwich today.  Not sure why, but will definitely consider alternatives going forward.
__label__3	"When Mad Mex is packed, New Deck is a reliable default.  A table will always be open for you and your crew.  You have your choice of long tables in a quieter downstairs, or small- and medium-sized tables in the busier upstairs.  Hit up the bar if you want to make new friends.

Pros are the variety of creative vodka drinks, scrumptiously fatty fries and location on Samsom Street.

Cons are the slow service, greasy menus, greasy food (i know, I just praised the fries, but the healthy options are lacking)."
__label__3	"Lobby hours keep changing. Given no employees are needed for the kiosk or PO boxes, I'm not sure why,.
They are completely out of packaging boxes and priority tape doesn't exist either. They are out of many forms too"
__label__3	Open for dining inside and out, this Mexican restaurant is hopping for lunch. The menu was standard but the green quesadilla caught my eye: made with a spinach tortilla stuffed with broccoli, cauliflower and carrots along with some cheese. The veggies were tasty but it should have had more cheese to qualify as a quesadilla. The standard chips o. The table were good. The sauce was tasteless, I suspect it comes from a can.
__label__3	Gorgeous place. Food was OK expect my steak which was not good at all.
__label__3	The Q the Nachos had a ton of flavor, but the size of the pork rinds made it overwhelming to eat. Pork rinds were not easy to tear apart. My husband got the peri-peri hot chicks. He said the flavor for those was lacking. Atmosphere though you can't beat! Right by the rays stadium with awesome outdoor seating!
__label__3	This place is like any local mom and pop diner. We got classics like sausage gravy and biscuits and grits and my husband tried a special of stuffed blintzes with blueberry. We weren't overly impressed or disappointed. We left full and we didn't spend too much money. Service wasn't the best but the place was crowded the week before the Fourth of July and the waitress always had a smile on so we didn't mind the delay in refilling water or coffee or the bringing the bill.
__label__3	Ambiance is great...service is good...not so cool for kids.
__label__3	Food was decent. Had corned beef and cabbage but the corn beef was shredded whih. Beer and I'm beyond for nice. Virtually nobody in the restaurant but my group. The waitress was absolutely overwhelmed. Drinks were slow & food was slow, but she was very apologetic.
__label__3	2/14/21 - Reserved a table for valentines and wasn't very impressed. Cocktail wasn't great and neither was the teriyaki quinoa bowl or the margarita pizza. It seems like a good place for lunch though!
__label__3	The place came highly recommended.  It was okay but not great.  My red beans and rice were lukewarm at best.  Sausage was very cheery.  Service was so so.  Not remarkable enough to go back.
__label__3	Everyone and their mother (or father) love Lolita. Except me. Entrees are predictable, mediocre and often too heavy. Stick to guacamole and their excellent mixers for margaritas. Don't forget to bring your cash and tequila, both are required for a good time.
__label__3	Margarita and service was great.. Ordered take away after a drink at the bar and got home to a long piece of hair on my linguini dish with cheese melted on it.. I know that stuff happens sometimes but really grossed me out..
__label__3	"This is a good sushi place near the USF area. They have Usf discounts with proof of your USF ID and specials for date nights.

I personally enjoy their mochi and the monster roll."
__label__3	"Decent place to hangout and grab a drink. Service was pretty slow, but our server had a lot of tables. 

Good fries and beer selection, would definitely give another shot."
__label__3	Good bar / restaurant for watching a game or hanging with friends.  We usually go for appetizers and drinks, which have yet to disappoint.  Try the home-made mushroom caps, they are fresh and really good.
__label__3	Went few times with friends.Had a great time....wonderful atmosphere. .Drinks and food was great ss well as service.
__label__3	We had the breakfast buffet and it was good! Nothing spectacular but did the job! It was 10.95 a person and had Biscuits and gravy, sausage links, bacon, pancakes, Grits, eggs, and fried potatoes. It also had fruit! Drinks are extra!
__label__3	Quality is fresh and staff is friendly; however, I felt you get more for the same price at a competitor Poke spot.
__label__3	"The drinks are cheap. The bartenders are rude. An apparent regular was happy, she had a dog in the bar. I got there around 8 and thought, cool place, what could go wrong.

Apparently a lot. 

Not that Im complaining.  

You should definitely go to this bar.  But dont talk to anyone, and leave before its too late."
__label__3	"First time this evening based on friend's recommendation. 
Service decent. Average sushi. Spicy tuna not spicy. Menus are dirty."
__label__3	We loved to go to DanDan every time we visited Phily. but yesterday we were very disappointed because our favorite dish Punkin rice noodle was not prepared well.  it's not salty at all and looked like it had been sitting in the kitchen for a while. yesterday was very crowded in Dan Dan. maybe that's the reason. but when your favorite dish was not prepared well, you got really disappointed.
__label__3	Please hire a Mexicano. Good crowd.giid service. Margarita lame,  beans cold. Replacement beans also cold.
__label__3	"Bob was a great tour guide.
But i definitely expected more food for the food tour. when they say sample size they mean it. I was hoping for at least a small appetizer size portion, in actualitiy you get a sauce size portion.  Don't go on the tour hungry."
__label__3	It was alright. I had the brown rice and it was seriously undercooked which kind of ruined the entire bowl. The staff put way too much spicy mayo on it, so I could hardly taste any of the other ingredients. Compared to other poke places in the city, you don't get as much or as many options for the same price. I really wanted to like this place but I don't think I'll go back.
__label__3	"History tour-- yes
Walking tour--yes
Sightseeing---yes
Haunted tour--no
Ghost stories--no
Worth the $$$$--no
Recommend to a friend--no"
__label__3	Not bad but overrated. First of all, if you are going to call your self biscuit love, you better have the best biscuits in all of Nashville and they don't. The bronuts were delicious and I highly recommend them. Beyond the bronuts, I was underwhelmed.
__label__3	"Had an okay experience with the drive thru.  The food was alright, but what bothered me was the attitude of the manager or shift leader that was on duty.  She started screaming at the guy at the window, ""You're food is ready, why aren't you moving?!?!  Go, go go!!!""  People don't deserve to be yelled at like they are a dog.  Perhaps this person should go through management training again or otherwise learn how to treat their fellow human beings with respect."
__label__3	Sorry, not all that. Reasonable, but not great. Oysters however were awesome and staff were nice/cool but overall no more than 3-stars.
__label__3	As I posted before main dish good but dessert on the naughty list.  The swordfish had s great texture.
__label__3	"Petsmart is not my favorite-I prefer Pet Supermarket, but this location is close to where I work. 

Located in the Walmart shopping center, their selection seems to be lacking and they seem to never have enough associates working.  

Not bad if you need down thing quickly but don't expect top notch service."
__label__3	"I had a hard time rating this restaurant. We had a lovely time and the food was very good. Yet I was put off by the over produced atmosphere. They have worked to create an English pub in Philadelphia but the result gave me the creeps. The term Disneyesque comes to mind... Also the are so heavily staffed that we saw two employee literally fall over each other. 

Drinks were fantastic and the service is very good. Portions are quite modest while prices are on the high side."
__label__3	While I much prefer to eat at privately owned restaurants versus chains, I do have a soft spot for the 'Bee's.  I just enjoy the atmosphere, the food and prices aren't too over the top.  We go to this particular one from time to time and have had very consistent service and food.  No complaints and always enjoy ourselves.  It's probably one of the better Applebee's I've been to ever.
__label__3	there were only 2 people in line in front of me, and it sill took 15 minutes.  but when i got to the counter, it only took me 1 minute.  the staff was friendly and knew what they were doing.  but there weren't enough people working
__label__3	It's a cafe that's open 24/7 which is nice if your staying in the hotel. The food and service were both good and the prices were reasonable as well. We are here twice during our stay.
__label__3	"I can't speak to any other feature of Whispering Hills aside from the rec center but that spot was very nice!  Indoor pool with roll up doors for summertime and a pretty elaborate work out center.  

Locker rooms could be better set up (throw me a bench to sit down on?)  but i am assumign most residents drop in for a work out and change in apratments"
__label__3	Having a place to eat on the water is awesome! We've often parked our boat outside of this place; today we went in for the first time. The service was great! I personally did not like the food; the other people in our party felt that the food was average. When we got the bill, we were surprised! It was much more expensive than we thought it would be. The price tag didn't fit the experience for us. It is in a great location with great service, however.
__label__3	The atmosphere is great and the staff is very friendly. It's the perfect place for a quick, low-key bite to eat but the food is a bit overpriced for the quality and portion sizes. I stopped by for an early dinner with friends and we had fun! Loved the spinning round table. Would go again for their milkshakes and the cute ambiance
__label__3	Bought a car and had a repair written into the contract. Weeks later and it still has not been fixed. After several calls the repair was finally complete.
__label__3	Not a huge selection but the food was pretty good - had the shrimp tacos, kids had crab legs. I didn't really care for the jicama slaw on the shrimp tacos. Service is hit or miss - you may get a great server or you may get someone who seems like they would rather be anywhere but there.
__label__3	"Hello, the gateway world health is pretty good. I feel like I'm getting a good workout when I go there 
My beef is the male bathrooms, you know guys will be guys but when there is an old guy on the toilet having a #2 with the door open. It is bad enough he runs around naked but have a little respect and close the bathroom stall door when taking a dump"
__label__3	Fantastic Chicago dog's, beef, sausage! Consistency on quantity of beef in a combo compared to the other locations is an ongoing problem it seems. I would give 5 stars if they can figure out the beef and sausage combo ratio correctly.  Never a problem in the Chicago suburbs or Merrillville. Get the Portillo's app and order from it. There's hardly a 5 minute wait for food if you use the app.
__label__3	Decent food and friendly staff. I guess I didn't order right and the po boy was too dry. The bread wasn't stale, just dry and made me cough on my first bite. The fried pickles were delicious however!
__label__3	Views are perfect, drinks overpriced, food small portions and quite plain. I ordered a Mojito that came in a small plastic cup and it tasted like bottom Shelf liquor for $11. I ordered Mahi Mahi Tacos that were at best okay.  I got two tacos and about five chips with small dish of salsa and that was it. No sides offered. You are definitely paying the price for the view. Be aware that they allow smoking in the outside eating area, that was disappointing. Live music was good, service was average.
__label__3	Food for people who think Dominos is good pizza or Panda Express is quality Chinese food. Nothing remarkable.
__label__3	"Solid three-star place for lunch. I use to love their tofu sandwich but they took it off the menu. There's a couple deli style sandwiches but nothing to write home about. The groceries seem fresh but overpriced. The service is usually good and I love cute, organic atmosphere.

Beware that there are a lot of people (read: hipsters and college kids) who come to study and take up the few tables. Most of the time it's hard to get seating and there's no AC which is a pain in the summer."
__label__3	"Ordered the catfish and shrimp combo. The shrimp and all of the sides were great bu the catfish didn't seem fresh to me. If your name has catfish in it it better be the "" best "" thing on your menu!"
__label__3	"I have been to most restaurants on The Hill but hadn't tried this restaurant yet. Food was good, no complaints. I had the salad and tortellini..friend had chicken spedini and was good also. 
I wouldn't make it a point to come back but would go if invited."
__label__3	Mexican food for non-Mexicans... or at least for those who don't know any better. The salsa had sugar in it to tame down the already unspectacular spiciness level. It set the tone of my meal - underwhelming. I am offended that they pass this as authentic Mexican food. A small redeeming feature was the peaceful ambient compared to the chaotic fast food area across the hall.
__label__3	"First off, very friendly staff. No issues with service at all. The deal seems to be the bento box, you get the most bang for your buck and the various items all were quality. The shrimp tempura was bland though, not sure why but something was missing.
The rolls are small. Maybe I'm spoiled by my standards but the rolls here just didn't do it for me. Taste was decent, but size, not so much. I was hungry an hour later, seriously. Nigiri was tasty though, my selection was pretty decent and fresh."
__label__3	"We came here to sit outside and enjoy some drinks while in Nashville for a bachelorette party. The waiter ran around getting our drinks: we were annoying, ordering separately and such and the waiter stayed super friendly and pleasant. 

The food is nothing to write home about, but that's to be expected I would think. Don't get me wrong: it wasn't bad, but it's your standard pub grub.

The drinks were reasonable and it attracts a fun crowd. I would recommend stopping in here for some drinks."
__label__3	I stopped in for a quick happy hour function. I was a little late so things had already wound down by the time I got there. I didn't really want to GET DOWN so I just had my usual Captain Coke... I almost got down by accident because that joint was a doozie!
__label__3	Decent place but you can probably do better. The food was a bit bland (we had Po-Boys and the shrimp platter, and some dessert). The six-year-old left most of her hamburger. They honored the 10% Yelp discount only after being reminded, and then added18% gratuity to the bill. We were here early (5.30 pm) for dinner and there was no wait, but when we left it was easily a 50 ft line outside.
__label__3	"My favs at this place are their peach margaritas and their chocolate peanut butter fried dough dessert. Sooo good.

Its a great happening place to watch a hockey game too. 

Only cons I have experienced is when the staff say the ""blender is broken"" and that you feel like you are sitting in the road with a bunch of fumes when on their patio. lol. I wish they could have a rooftop patio like O2s!"
__label__3	This review isn't for the Italian Club itself, it is for the little pizza window that is on 7th that is part of the building. I like their pizza. They only have two choices that I was aware of. Pepperoni and Cheese. Also, they just cook the pie once instead of putting the slices individually back in the oven that gives superior joints and edge.
__label__3	Lots of unique rolls on the menu, and the ones I tried were really tasty - Birthday, Lover, Spicy Combo and iRoll.  Extremely speedy service, and BYOB was good, there is a great bottle shop around the corner.   Very small space - really only a small sushi bar to sit at, no real tables.  I liked this place, but I'd probably only get takeout if I went here again.
__label__3	"$3 Blue Moon, $2 Yuengling Porter. All the time. That should be all you need to know, but I was also pleasantly surprised by their food (the Spanish fries were muy deliciosos, my friend's potato skins were cute but difficult to eat), and really great music being played even without the jukebox.

I am definitely coming back here to load up on affordable beer while actually enjoying the music and surprisingly great service. Great for weeknight drinking."
__label__3	This is a decent specimen of a Trader Joe's.  It's medium size, and it's never been too crowded.  Service is always friendly, and they have more produce than some of other locations I've been to.  Between this place and Whole Foods down the street, anyone's organic food needs can be met.
__label__3	"I went here for my birthday dinner. First off, the service was great!  Our waiter was very friendly and service was excellent.  Our drinks were also fabulous. Delicious and strong. 
The food however was just ok.  We had guac and that was probably the best.  The verde empanadas were just ok and the veggie paela was a bit tasteless.  Apparently not eating meat in Cuba is tough..."
__label__3	Pretty good. But the teeny bopper/ hooters vibe is creepy. Am I getting pizza? No need to treat me like a dog that needs a laps dance from a fifteen year old with every sandwich.  Maybe just try to make better sandwiches.
__label__3	Came here on a Sunday morning. It seemed they had more staff than customers and it still took quite awhile for our food.  It was simple avocado toast, I didn't think it would take long but maybe it's a Nashville thing to slow things up and enjoy the moment.  The toast was excellent and the server was nice enough but for what we paid I don't think this place was amazing.
__label__3	"(3.5) ~ Overall Food & Service

MY MENU:
* Margaritaville(drink) = (3.5) good
* Calamari = (3.5) good
* Hogfish(entree) = (4) very good & flaky
* Ice Cream = (3.5) good
* Coffee = (3) ok"
__label__3	This is a decent Indian option in Uptown. They have a buffet on Sundays and Thursdays (I think). It won't be the best Indian food you've ever had, but it will most likely satisfy your hankering for some Aloo Gobi.
__label__3	Decent Target. Good size, clean, with the majority of what you'd expect at a Target. No Starbucks. But it's an all right Target to shop at if you're nearby.
__label__3	Food was good. Got the crab stuffed chicken breast which was very tasty. However, the servers definitely made us feel out of place being the only  Americans dressed casually there although I don't think the server realized it. Subconscious bias? I hope in the future to be treated as well as Caucasian guests.
__label__3	Been meaning to try this place for a while since it's so close to work. I ordered the Crispy Chicken not realizing it was in a sweet and sour type sauce. It tasted good, chicken was very crispy, but it was basically sweet and sour chicken. Not what I was expecting and reminded me of Chinese food more than Thai. I'll have to try other dishes. The green curry looked good, should have gone with that.
__label__3	Lambert is an OK airport, you can't get lost, and there is a great panda express there. My only gripe with Lambert is that there is no place to get Root Beer. When I travel, I need a nice cold root beer to calm me down before or during the flight. None of the shops or restaurants offer root beer. Life without RB is no place for me.
__label__3	Nodding Head is a fun place to go in a big group, since there is a decent amount of room as Center City bars go.  I didn't get any food, but my friends said what they had was good.
__label__3	Don't let the three-stars shine badly on their beer which is ubergrea!  Their portfolio boasts probably the best tasting suds of any craft brew maker around...four or five stars for sure.   The three stars come into play as the cavernous dining hall experience and food does not hold a candle to their beers.  Eats are OK, not offensive, but should be of similar calibur and quality as their core beverages. Beer fantastic, food not bad it just wasn't great!  Enough said!
__label__3	We've eaten here before and after a hard day at work we were looking forward to having a nice relaxing dinner. We started with the falafel dish, which we've had before and it is fresh and delicious!  We had the hummus as well, but it seemed to have a vinegar taste to it. For dinner we shared the Italian burger which was just ok. It taste like a meatball and was a little dry for my liking. The reason I'm giving three stars is because either the air wasn't working or something but it was so hot in there we were sweating!
__label__3	Luke's has been a go to in NoLa for the past ten years. It reminds me of a Parisian brasserie and is centrally located in the central business district. Our last visit to Luke's was fair. The service was excellent as always but the food seemed rather uninspired. We had their house gumbo along with fresh and fried oysters, but the other menu items, I cannot even recall days later. Luke's a place you can stop in for a burger and a beer - or oysters and a cocktail. The food's solid and the atmosphere upscale.
__label__3	"Just okay, would not go out of my way to get here or to avoid. 
I had the cheesesteak sandwich; okay nothing special.
Service was okay"
__label__3	It's all good here, if you can get service.  The menu is extensive, probably at least 100 items on it.  In many visits I have probably tried about half of them, as we order several items and share.  Personally, I like the chicken livers, and the potatoes and aioli is good.  The namesake Ceviche is wonderful.
__label__3	Located right in front of St. Pete Beach. Provides a scenic view whether you dine indoors or outdoors.  Food was okay. Popular tourist spot, small gift shop at entrance. This place needs updating and had some cleanliness issues...sticky table and dirty bathrooms!
__label__3	"I have stayed here many, many times over the past several years - my last visit being last week.  
The staff is very nice.  Breakfast in the morning is ok, but not great.  My room is usually ok, but I have noticed more wear-and-tear over the past year.  I think some renovations are needed.  They do not have enough power plugs in the rooms - I end up having to crawl around on the floor, reaching behind tables, and unplugging lamps to get my chargers plugged in.  That is inconvenient."
__label__3	The food was okay to good.  The lobster bisque soup is very good.  The tuna steak was good, but had too much tiki sauce on it and took away from the flavor of the tuna. The onion rings are very tasty.  I  wanted a refill on my soda. Could not get the waitress' attention.  The last time we were here we had the same type of experience.  Food is not cheap here, we don't expect waitresses with their backs turned to the customers and on their cell phones.
__label__3	Atmosphere was nice. Service was great, Ingredients were fresh. Unfortunately the crust of the pizza was soggy and as we ate pieces, we discovered the ever growing puddle of olive oil in the pan causing the soggy crust. I've read some of the reviews mentioning they had crispy thin crust here, so I'll give it another shot, hoping this was just a one time thing.
__label__3	Just an okay store to browse. Huge store and you can catch some good deals at times however despite how many times I've walked around browsing I've really only made two purchases in this store lol. I tend to stick to the shoes area. But it takes some patience for browsing. Shoes are organized by sizes but there is no organized manner to type of shoes. They did have some holiday chocolates and other holiday type gift items in the center of the store when we went.
__label__3	Cool place to stop if u r in town to kind of take it all in. Tastings are $10, they're open late and they like dogs! Not a huge fan of the actual wine though.
__label__3	"The good:
-Their Greek salad
-Lentil soups
-Their gyros

The ""meh"":
-The falafel falls kind of flat. The falafel at Fronimo's is leagues better

The bad:
-It would be nice to include drinks in the combos. I mean, the word ""combo"" implies an included drink.

Usually, this place is where I end up going when I can't think of anywhere better to go on University. There's better Greek out there, that's for sure, but this will do for a quick craving."
__label__3	"Totally overrated. We got 3 different pizzas all were overly salted and just okay. The staff was very attentive and pleasant.
Overall overpriced Steven Starr restaurant that probably wouldn't make it with his name attached to it."
__label__3	Great location. Outside bar and seating with spectacular mountain views to the east. Lots of different kinds of beer available. Decent wine selection, but go for the variety of beers. Menu is upscale bar food. Go for the small plates.
__label__3	Wings were barely warm as well as the corn. Ordered a large corn, which should be a 10 piece but we only got 6. Korean BBQ wings are good. Just check your food before you leave. The place wasn't busy so we don't know why order wasn't correct. Will probably try this location again and check order before leaving.
__label__3	"Very nice course and was in good shape except for one thing ... They had just sanded the greens.  Evidently they do this every Tuesday.  It made for less than ideal putting conditions and added several shots to my round as I never had a touch for the greens

At the very least they should notify you before you pay your $74!

Staff was nice and helpful.  Will be back, just not on Tuesday ..."
__label__3	I always want to like Kilroy's but it always fall short. When I think of Kilroy's it reminds me of college town and that's what this place caters to as well. Great location and space. Way too small of bathroom that seems to always be dirty. Large selection of drinks served in mini pitchers, unfortunately the drinks are heavy on mix and light on alcohol. Only redeeming quality that keeps us coming back are those breadsticks. Always hot, always delicious
__label__3	It's a Hooter, everyone I have been too have been the same.  What you get at one location is what you get at another location.  At least you know what to expect when you go to one.  4 STARS FOR THE BREADED WINGS WITH HOT SAUCE ON THE SIDE. YUM(Love their wings!).
__label__3	Before tonight I hadn't to BWW in quite sometime. I was pleasantly surprised by my food tonight. It is standard sports bar decor. TVs everywhere!! They show every football game and every UFC fight as well. They also have some arcade games, golden tee, basketball and some shooting games.  Another positive is a nice outdoor seating area. Overall it's an average sports bar. Just like with any chain restaurant the staff and cleanliness is what sets it apart. I had no issues with either at this location. My visit was well enough to make rethink my hiatus from B-dub.
__label__3	"Love this place.
Great breakfast sandwiches  
Bagels are always fresh out of the oven. 

Only down side to this place is there is there is No Price bored or menu really when walking in.... I would have gotten more if I knew the pricing of items..."
__label__3	"Food was great got seated fast I think the only complaint I have was there was too much food and maybe the music was a little loud but other than that enjoyed it. 

OK so we're back again we've been back twice since my first review the food is always good the service is just horrible. These folks pretending to be waiters and waitresses do not care that you were sitting in their section. They think it's OK to serve appetizers with no plates and they think it's funny. Maybe we should order to go that might be OK"
__label__3	Love the concept of the place but the food in general is a bit bland.  Takes hot sauce to save the day.
__label__3	This place is decent. Bring a bottle of wine and enjoy a pretty economical meal. Extremely fair value for the experience. This is a potential do over.
__label__3	"It's more like 3.5 stars. I had the braised meatball which was an about  5"" square wrap with ground beef meatballs, brown rice and cabbage with an Asian inspired sauce. It was tasty, for sure, but it wasn't enough for me. It was over in about 4 bites. Wish they'd increase the size."
__label__3	I think this is probably a 4 or 5 star place but I am reserving that for a follow up visit.  I had the dream sandwich (with chicken) and that had eggplant and potatoes in the wrap.  It tasted very fresh but I was unimpressed.  The baklava (choclava?) was very good and I wanted to try other pastries.  Service was very friendly.  I happened on them because another place nearby was closed I was expecting to be open.  They did have a decent menu.
__label__3	"This was my first experience with First Watch. I would say that it is just ok. The building is beautiful but the mass amounts of hard surface made for a very noisy room. Too noisy to enjoy conversation. I will say that our waiter was extremely efficient. Friendly and very accessible. 
The food is of very high quality and preparation was top notch but I am not a fan of paying over $40.00 for a simple breakfast for two. Just my opinion."
__label__3	Placed an order for a coworkers birthday. The delivery was 30 mins late from time placed. The product was fantastic. I was upset that knowing it was a gift as specified on the notes the receipt left on the box.
__label__3	The venue was multi-level with different DJs. Drink prices were decent. At the end of the night the DJ  was a wreck. ...he needs to work on smooth transitions between songs.
__label__3	Shuttle service to Tropicana is nice touch, just be prepared to wait when getting picked up. Try and leave 20-30 min before game, because we had drop someone off at publix and a restaurant before going.
__label__3	The prices here is higher per gallon compared to other locations. This is expected for the convenience inside the city. This station does not take part in the Shell Fuel program. The pumps are self serve without any attendants.
__label__3	"over priced on services, also, purchased a ton of product, one of the pumps didn't work.....When I called and spoke to ""manager"" she never said sorry or anything, you'll have to come in and swap out is all she said.  what happened to customer service... Ughhhh...."
__label__3	Tasty food, but must have hit an off night on service - food took 90 minutes for main courses, ran out of alcohol and water multiple times, no acknowledgement of poor service. Not in a rush to come back.
__label__3	We love that Tamarack's sports bar is family friendly, supports local sports teams, and the food is always great. Yet, we are constantly disappointed by the service... Not that the waiters or waitresses are bad - they are great- they are just too overwhelmed that they can not keep up with the Sunday NFL crowd. Waiting 20+ minutes to order or for a refill dampens the experience. They need to staff more servers!!!!
__label__3	Because of the reviews I was expecting so much more.  I arrived 20 minutes before closing and ordered the brisket sandwich.  The greeter was nice.  Let me just jump right in...the brisket was tender but it tasted boiled instead of grilled.  A bit lack luster but good.  They didn't have any au gratin potatoes left so I settled for a baked potato.  Overall, I would come again when in Nashville and try the ribs or something else.
__label__3	Tijuana Flats was decent.  I would not call it authentic Mexican food but it was OK.  I ordered dos tacos and my companion the taco salad with black beans.  She also ordered guacamole and enjoyed that.  Service was very energetic (too much Red Bull?) and helpful.  It's the type of place where you order at the counter and they bring your food out to you.
__label__3	I used to love this place, I still do but they have limited selection of food and sometimes there food are good and sometimes there not good. There NOT consistent...
__label__3	"Placed a to go order every one acted confused as heck by that. I walk in can't get anyone to acknowledge me. Won't be back. The girl had to actually call me back and ask questions she didn't on the phone. Everyone is talking tips around me.

Edit- Got home and my order wasn't right. The manager was very kind and too generous in making the situation right. I will be back and give the place a second shot at some point in the future."
__label__3	If you like cake donuts, this is your spot. If like like donuts, this might not be your best bet. The employee was amazing and friendly, just not what we expected being majority cake donuts. Maybe if the original donut was warm it would be better.
__label__3	Great look/feel. Insane wait. Avg food. Good biscuit/homemade jam. Made a mistake with biscuits and gravy. Beware the red aged sausage. This is like an Apple Store on phone day, but with bad gravy. I think we were supposed to order the funny appetizer and hot chicken. Fountain coca-cola. You heard it here first.
__label__3	"Do you, often, hit First Friday galleries? 
Do you, sometimes, dream of a very creamy, very luxurious Lobster-Mac-n-Cheese?
Do you, occasionally, crave some shredded fries with Chinese mustard sauce twist?

You're not alone. 
So do the right thing, and go to Continental Restaurant and Martini Bar. 
I've eaten here several times, and so should you! I've never been disappointed.

Three and Half Yelps."
__label__3	It's been a while since I been in. I came in a few years back... not to this location but another to see and purchase some of their fabulous Christmas decor after the holidays. They didn't have 50% this time and not much of a selection. I asked the person that works there if he thought everything would be reduced more and he said probably not but gave me passes to their garage sale store wide... it's coming up beginning of January so I'll have to remember that.
__label__3	"I thought the food was great, BUT
they need to learn how to cook the rice to perfection.   Since its undercooked, you'll likely to be extremely  swollen, and pretty sick about an hour later, when that rice expands in your stomach.

if you know that going in?  you'll be better off later.
other than that MAJOR complaint
the food is really good."
__label__3	We have eaten here a few times by default really. Service is fine, food is ok but it's nothing to write home about. The kitchen is open pretty late for a full service restaurant. The fish po boy was pretty good with some remoulade added. I would not consider this a destination place to eat. If your not sure where to eat and your reading this, walk across the street to Napoleon House.
__label__3	My wife got the iced coffee she said it was not very good. Definitely not worth five and half bucks
__label__3	It was ok. The food was a little less than I expected, given the reviews. The cocktail list is very basic. My mojito was too minty with small chunks of mint floating around in it, rather than whole leaves. That being said, it's a pizza joint, so the fact that they had a cocktail menu at all was nice. I would go back, if invited by someone.
__label__3	"This is your typical run of the mill walmart.  There are only a few things I look for when I enter any location:  cleanliness, availability, and spotless restrooms.  I didn't have an issue with those items here.  It looked like a newer store...

The lines were running smoothly and it wasn't overpacked.  

Solid 3 stars."
__label__3	"I'd give a 3.5 because I tried Pat's next door and liked that better.  This restaurant is impossible to miss because of it's 10 million neon lights. You'd think you were in Vegas!

Anyway, I just got a cheese steak with American cheese. The meat was lean but it didn't have that much flavor. The bread was okay also.  Be careful of their hot sauce because it really is HOT!"
__label__3	We had a great time to day. A fun place to entertain kids, but definitely expensive.  Looking forward to seeing the final products!
__label__3	Nippon Tei used to be my favorite sushi place in STL.  I've either grown old of it or their quality isn't as good.  Many of the rolls are packed with tempura.  For example, their Baked Manchester used to be my fav but now it's hard to get to the seafood in this dish.  You have to dig through the starches.  Service is still very good.  I just would rather visit somewhere else going forward.
__label__3	The Collar is a good neighborhood bar.  They have a nice selection of beers for a good price for the area and the food is typical bar food but always good and you know what to expect!  I definitely enjoy stopping by to grab a bite and a quick drink.
__label__3	"The lady at the front desk (I didn't catch her name) was SO nice,as was the nurse who took my vitals. The doctor, however, seemed like she could care less and sent me on my way after maybe 3 minutes in the room with me. Every question I asked was answered with ""I don't know, maybe?"". A waste of 2 hours."
__label__3	This location is very much like an Airport Boutique version of the regular restaurants. The food was okay but the atmosphere is kind of crammed. They also don't do the Birthday sparklers which are a staple of Sugar Factory celebrations. I had the Rainbow Sliders, Signature Sugar Factor Burger with Fries, and The Brownie for dessert. The food was good but overpriced for what it was.
__label__3	Great place to watch the game. TVs everywhere! Amazing sound, cool outdoor amphitheater and wrap around balcony. Limited menu for big events exceptional. Wish they would bring the grilled cheese sandwich back! Uber parkings a hassle.
__label__3	This is a create place they have many color options and it's so relaxing the staff are friendly and nice I recommend you go here if you want to truly relax. It is gorgeous and so clean!! The only thing is the chairs are to high I'm short and my feet were dangling in the water I had to slump down in the seat to reach the place where the paint your toes it's nice but needs improvement
__label__3	"Update on my review: 

This was investigated by Apple, the cameras were checked & the employee was fired.

The store leader was very helpful."
__label__3	"Food ok, nothing special. Nothing interesting on menu. Rushed service. 
Could be ok for a first date when you need a neutral safe spot."
__label__3	place is small, service is okay. i thought the food was a little too salty. it was my first place trying bun bo hue so i can't speak for how good it is etc, but was slightly taken aback by the taste. not a place if you're looking for pho or the usual mainstream vietnamese food.
__label__3	This is an old school diner-style breakfast joint in Swarthmore with great character. Our meals (eggs, bacon, toast, homemade home fries; blueberry pancakes) were prepared to order and served efficiently. The menu is somewhat limited but quite satisfactory for breakfast or a basic lunch. Not fancy, but satisfying.
__label__3	"First timers!!!
We sat ourselves, went around 5pm and had no wait. Waiters were pretty cool.  Definitely enjoyed having a variety of drinks to choose from. We ordered egg rolls to share and they weren't too bad. 
 We spent $48 on 2 drinks (1 each) & egg rolls, I thought tht was a little expensive, they also automatically add your tip .  Menus were also sticky and unclean. 

I would go back for drinks maybe during happy hour (if they have one)"
__label__3	First visit here and I like the atmosphere although if you like your hearing don't go during a football game... after blocking out the noise my service was prompt and waitress was patient. I ordered a grilled chicken chipotle wrap with waffle fries. It was awesome and well put together. Dipping sauce on the side would make it even better. I saw families prior to 7pm and friends, couples and parties after.. Nice time overall... but I can't hear.
__label__3	Good food, but bad service from the cashier. We were brought the wrong food by him and he still gets really mad when we tell him he got the wrong order.
__label__3	This is tough to say but I give this place 3 stars not because of the food (good), the waitstaff (adequate) but because this place always smells like dirty, wet mop! And why? It's a brand new restaurant! It really makes me question the restaurant's cleanliness.
__label__3	I have had lunch at Pastiche, this was my first dinner experience. The service was adequate. I ordered the Steak Frites and requested the steak to be rare. It was closer to medium. My husband ordered the New York Strip special. He said it was the worse steak he ever had. It was a challenge to cut and full of fat and gristle. I requested lime for my water and it was promptly delivered. It could have just been a bad night in the kitchen and a less than quality piece of meat. The restaurant was nicely decorated for the holidays.
__label__3	We stopped in here for quick sushi lunch craving.  First of all, I ordered the kani salad and was given mainly cucumber with barely any crab meat in there. Basically ordered the general common rolls, which were decent for a small sushi bar, I'm not asking for too much.
__label__3	Honestly I wasn't really impressed. The only thing I enjoyed was their fries. AMAZING. But everything else was subpar. They forgot part of my order, I had to remind the waitress twice. They have a lot of potential.
__label__3	"The coffee is good, the breakfast sandwich is good, too. But, I miss the ""old"" Perfect Cup. It was more of a community center with friends gathering here for coffee and... The equipment upgrades have increased the noise significantly making it difficult to carry on a conversation. I still plan to come here from time to time for a quick bite, but not for an extended conversation. Also, go early in the morning, especially on weekends, as the line to order and pay is sometimes out the door."
__label__3	This place is located in a great area, near downtown. Our server was very friendly, but the pizza was just ok. I'm a wood fired pizza snob and this one was not good enough to warrant a return visit. We got the margarita and the sauce was too tart and the crust too thick and dense. Still looking for that perfect pizza with a light chewy crust, fresh tomato and mozzarella.
__label__3	I went to two weddings within the last year and both times I selected  the filet.  The food tasted like convention food .  Another guest said the chicken was tasteless.  For the price, it was really disappointing.  Over the years I have been to several weddings at Tavistock  and the food was good, but now , mediocre at best.
__label__3	Oh my! Delicisioso steak sandwich! Worth the $$ the sirloin will practically in your mouth. Well compared to other steak sandwiches I've had.  People are friendly.
__label__3	"Oh my.  Please move to my hometown!

All of these tastes are my favorites.  The cauliflower is absolutely outstanding.  Octopus and shrimp bruschetta is delightful - the capers make it all happen.


The venison was over-seasoned and overcooked.  It was edible but a disappointment.

There is a lot of the menu I would like to explore and the originality caught my attention immediately.  One bad dish is not the end of the world, especially after such a lovely time.  I shall return!"
__label__3	"I was a bit tipsy and starving, so I got a ""Lucky Dog."" I added chili and onions and it was 1/3 pound of hot dog. I couldn't eat it all and actually after I ate 2/3rds of it, I didn't want to eat all of it. It sure did taste good at the start though."
__label__3	Slow service cold food but good food.  Very unique menu.  Just disappointing about the service. I would definitely give them another shot though.
__label__3	I just stopped in briefly. I had the Kanno Special. It was very fresh....I was sad they only had ONE white wine, chardonnay, so I went with ice water. The space is quite clean/modern, but it did just open. I am sorry, but it is in no way better than Akira....maybe after a few months more experience. Don't blink or you will miss the little building on 20th street. I find it hard to believe the other reviews stating it is the best in NOLA.....
__label__3	Everyone was nice and all and the food was good but it was too pricey. They charged a $6 sharing fee. We ordered less food and shared amongst ourselves and the price was unreasonable. Overall okay experience though.
__label__3	"You've got to get grouper when you go to Florida, so that's what everyone in our group got. Tried it four ways: broiled, fried, beer battered, and blackened. And that's how I liked it, from best to worst. Thankfully, I was the one who ordered it broiled, so I got to eat the most of the best.

The restaurant renovations are nice, but service was kind of slow, and the side dishes were nothing to write home about. Grouper was A-OK, though, just as the 3-star review implies."
__label__3	Food are great love the place but after I eat I went to the bathroom to wash my hands I saw one of the worker went to the bathroom walk out without washings their hand it just nasty!!!!!! :( so dirty and unsanitary! !!!
__label__3	I have eaten there four times now. Pulled Pork sandwich had a grease soaked bun. Then I read the reviewed and decided to try again. Had the Brisket Plate twice. Great! Tender. Tangy. Tasty. Did not even need any BBQ Sauce. Definitely a 5. Then I had a Pulled Pork Plate. I tried to soak up the excess grease with a napkin before I could begin eating. But it was still dripping with grease. Definitely a 1. So I am averaging the 2 and rating this establishment a 3.
__label__3	Very expensive, the food did not sit well with neither of the three of us. We all thought the bread was very very odd. I would not come back. Some dishes were pretty flavorful.
__label__3	This is a review if the delivery service.  Used the Yelp coupon.  These guys are very friendly.  I ordered the chicken piccata.  Good size portions.   A little oiler and not as tangy as I would have liked but not bad for the price and convenience.  My husband had a pizza which looked good. He didn't like the really thick crust.  But that's a matter of preference.
__label__3	Pretty good pizza. A ton of options. Great alcohol selection as well. We came at a pretty dead time so I can't really attest to service but it was good since we were the only ones there
__label__3	Drinks were delicious and food was great. Service was severely lacking. Took twenty minutes to get service after being seated in a half full dining room. Once our server took our order she was relatively attentive however she  brought our check quickly after the food was dropped off at the table which seemed a bit rude.  I'd give this spot a second chance if the service improves.
__label__3	Consistent with Olive garden quality, good service even when crowded. Parking is an issue at peak times
__label__3	Honky Tonkin on 3 levels. You can go up or down until you find some band you like. The place gets packed just about any night of the week. You will see some awesome musicians in here, the local bar bands in Nashville are the most talented I have ever seen.
__label__3	Regular to be honest, guacamole is ok. Music is nice, they was playing some J Balvin songs.
__label__3	Great dinner but every time I go there's a lne and wait for a booth foods awesome not to overpriced
__label__3	Walked from the hotel and stumbled upon this restaurant. The pizza was delicious! All the ingredients were fresh. I gave it three stars because the service was awful. I was the only person sitting at the bar during lunch. The bartender didn't want to wait on me or simply didn't want to be at work. He did not want to engage in conversation and at some point disappeared. Will definitely get my pizza to go next time.
__label__3	"ruined my experience by coming ""late night"" (9:45pm) on a Saturday night.  

ZERO service, get it yourself, get all food, napkins, silverware, beers, etc... from the bar. 

should try coming back durring regular business hours. but probably wont.

good beers though."
__label__3	Great to place to eat. The service is always great. I only get the rib platter so I havent tried too much on the menu, but the BBQ sauces are big for me. There are soo many flavors and i like to mix and match the sauces. The cornbread muffin is probably my favorite part of the whole meal.  The liquor drinks arent strong for the for the price thats charged, but Overall great place.  Definitely will continue ti eat here.
__label__3	Great food, nice atmosphere, super nice waiter. But, each time we go the cost gets higher and higher.  So I rate the place as a good place to eat but it's pricing me from visiting anymore.
__label__3	"This place has good food, but is pretty expensive.  The 4th street location now has mofungo, which is probably my favorite thing on the menu.  The calamari is really good and comes with chipotle and habanero dips which make the dish.

Their Sunday brunch is a good food experience, but again, kinda pricey."
__label__3	"Went here for ramen because I read good reviews about it. It was okay. The place is a really cool bar, but not so much of a restaurant. Would recommend for drinking/ socializing, but not for eating a nice meal.
Also, heads up, they add 18% gratuity to your dinner check, so if you don't look closely, you may end up double tipping!!"
__label__3	Eh. I was excited to try but won't buy again. I tried 8 different dumplings. Most of which were not very good. I had to wait about 8-10 mins for my order. For a mall joint I wasn't expecting that. Was hoping I could get my food and go. Not sure what the wait was about. Also the packaging sucks. They fit all 16 dumplings in one tiny Chinese container box. I did think the coffee bubble tea was decent.
__label__3	Been so excited to try this place bc it looks cute and original but was kinda bummed.. Chop salad was yummy even though it wasnt really chopped haha also got the chicken noodle and was super disappointed in how bland it was.. was expected a lot better. Also tried my friends mushroom and was also not blown away. Sammys might be worth a try!
__label__3	"Over all I give it 3 stars, but if i was rating the burgers Id give it four stars. the wings arnt great, the burger taste like its right of a charcoal grill yummy. 
the chicken fingers smothered in wing sauce are good, I like the fries but they are very salty."
__label__3	Good crust, ok sauce, too much cheese. Lots of interesting people working here. No way near the best or the worst pizza I've had.
__label__3	Went Sunday afternoon of Memorial Day weekend. Were out of almost everything meat so we went else where. Go early I guess.
__label__3	Tried this place while in town for business and was underwhelmed. The service was great, but the food was just OK. Was expecting more, so I'll try somewhere else the next time I'm in town.
__label__3	has a great time here.  experienced my first live performance with the band that was there when  i dropped in.  muscicians seemed really tired though but hey it was the end of the essence festival.  it was a fun place.
__label__3	"Stopped in for lunch. Food was great but service was awful. Took 30 minutes to bring my drink order another 30 for food. 

Maybe it's not normal because manager was apologizing to other tables but I wouldn't go back."
__label__3	Our party of 7 was seated quickly but not together.  We ordered the fried green tomatoes, crawfish étouffée, fried chicken and waffles, shrimp and grits, side salad.  The food and cocktails came out not too long after ordering.  I like my waffles crunchy on outside and soft and moist on inside.  The waffles ordered here came out soft like they were reheated in microwave.  The tabasco honey sauce for the waffles were very sweet and not enough heat.  I did enjoy the big shrimp on the fried green tomatoes and shrimp and grits.
__label__3	Beautiful restaurant and excellent menu. We've been excited to try this place for 3 months after my parents raved about it. The food was good, but the rude attitude of our server, kevin, ruined the whole meal. I guess he didn't like having to refill our water glasses, which would have been a non issue if he filled them up vs half full each time. This was also not a low staff issue because there were plenty of servers who looked much more pleasant. We ended up just taking the rest of our food to go.
__label__3	Servers so busy busing tables they took forever to take order and bring check. It was during lunch no one was there so can't understand the slow slow service.
__label__3	Normally service is very good. But today at lunch it was not up to par. The waitress could not even get a simple request right. And when asked she got a bit short. Then we asked for a to go cup and never got it.
__label__3	Went there for a state inspection today. Service was easy. Didn't wait long and In & out within 30 min.
__label__3	With pub in the name, I expected more taps. I had a salad that was good. But this is strip mall pedestrian food.
__label__3	Cocktails are great here, Ramen is good, but portions small, meat and noodles skimp too and they nickel and dime you on adding items-should include more in the bowl itself. All in all if you can't drive to Journey East in Mandeville which is the best Ramen in Nola this is a good substitute. But could be better.
__label__3	"I've been sampling local coffee spots in Reno for years (trying to avoid sbux and Dutch at all costs). The roost has fantastic coffee and great service. All drinks are reasonably priced, and more appropriately, have a good amount of shots depending on the size of the drink. Great place 


Update: poor experience with two of the staff members there lead to a lower review. One girl just seems so unhappy and unwilling to accommodate. She made my drink wrong and denied it then gave attitude when I urged her to remake. Not worth the bother going back."
__label__3	"Good flavor, portions are small.  I ordered to go, and I was so disappointed when we got home because the portions were very small.  This is not family style dinning where a dish can be shared.  You must order one entre per person, and one appetizer per person.  Otherwise, you will be hungry at the end. 

The food was fresh and tasty, but the price is high for the portions they serve. We ordered 2 orders of spring rolls, 2 orders of chicken sate, papaya salad, green curry for four and the amount of food was not enough."
__label__3	"The vet herself is good. The front desk staff is fake and rude. They can't be bothered to greet anyone when they walk in, even the ups guy had to beg for her attention. They act like clients are annoying them.

They don't have great communication, my experience trying to get my pups immunization records to move to a different vet proved difficult."
__label__3	"This place is like Qudoba but a wee but more upscale.  It's still counter service but they are not building your taco from a buffet line of bins.  Food is not bad as long as your not expecting anything authentic.

Only reason it gets 3 stars instead of 4 is that the tortilla chips were stale."
__label__3	I went there for my birthday and had reserved tables for my friends, they totally messed up my reservation. I would give them fewer stars but I like the place.
__label__3	"This is the theater I went to when I was in high school... It hasn't really changed much and is still your standard suburban cinema.

I find myself here anytime I come across free screening passes.. I would never choose to visit due to the extremely inconvenient location."
__label__3	Fast service, hesitant at first due to recent media coverage about customers paying for services and mechanics were not fixing the problem only saying they did.
__label__3	Went here for my anniversary dinner with my babe it was good but the servers should come out more with different meats.
__label__3	"If you're partying in the area or here after-hours, this McDonald's is one of your fine dining choices. Heck, even if you're shopping and have the urge to eat a McChicken, here you go.

It's cheap, and if all you want is Chicken McNuggets to slow the effects of booze on your bloodstream, there you go.

If only they had booze."
__label__3	The chili cheese fries here are really great! Wondering why they don't have vegan carrot cake lol but their food is good.
__label__3	The outdoor seating and tvs were great. Ordered a Friday special of Margarita pitcher which was a very small pitcher and lots of ice and very little tequila. Had to order an extra shot of tequila to cut down the super sweet taste. The chicken nachos were ok and my sons BBQ ribs were good. Wish I had ordered a beer as there were a lot on tap!!
__label__3	Ok at best.  We did a direct two day comparison with Five Guys in the Devon shopping center and Elevation Burger.  Elevation Burger just does not compare burger to burger, smaller patty with less flavor.  We did not try the shakes, but we heard from our daughter that they are very good.
__label__3	Food was okay, chicken was pretty dry and they took a pretty long time to brung out the food. Variety and taste was great though.
__label__3	It was just ok. I got the tomato soup and was a little disappointed as it wasn't as creamy as expected. I also had the personal Margherita pizza and it was good everything very fresh and was filling without feeling stuffed.
__label__3	"The food here is phenomenal--portions are large and delicious and the gelato is delightful.  

Decor is sort of odd--a hybrid of flashy glam and dated diner.  

While service was friendly, the food took an eternity to be delivered after ordering."
__label__3	Food is fresh rice and peas is tasty, jerk chicken was ok. Not spicy at all I'm use to my jerk chicken spicy and flavorful. But I'm willing to go back and try something else on the menu
__label__3	3-1/2 stars. Open air cafe near the French Market, featuring live music. We ordered the shrimp and andouille empanadas, which were decent; filling is minced, I was expecting larger bits of sausage.   The muffaletta was very good, with a half size being reasonably priced at $8.95; a large enough portion to split among 2. Outside heaters make this a nice place to take a break while sightseeing near the Mississippi River, just on the edge of the French Quarter.
__label__3	Ashlee was #1, music was #2. PLEASE GET A NEW DJ...Speaking for most generations, nobody wants to hear that.
__label__3	The wait here absolutely sucks. I had a nail in my tire (which I had repaired somewhere else). It was 530, they told me it would be an hour before they could look at it. I asked if I could leave and come back and was told that I had to be back at 6 when they closed, even though they wouldn't have even looked at my car until 630. Such a major inconvenience and time suck for things other Discount Tire locations or tire shops handle better. You would think they did vehicle repairs with the wait times they have.
__label__3	"Great food, if you want to watch the bartenders do shots w their favorite customers this is the place for you.  

Was great to sit and wait for a drink while they chatted with the locals, both bartenders btw.  I don't know, if I owned a bar, maybe I'd make it a priority to sell alcohol to people who wanted to buy it?  

Don't get me wrong, I'll be back because of the food, but I don't come here for the service, and we're there another option in the area, likely wouldn't come back."
__label__3	"I went in on a Saturday and even though there were cars they were quick. As I'm new to the neighborhood this is my first time here and I'm pleased with the service. I saw that they always try to sell any potential repairs but it seemed all warranted. In my case they did not recommend any service. I will return thank you very much guys
REVISION- service was quick but no sticker placed on car and left the door dirty. Did not notice until I left. May use if I need a quick service but would prefer better service shop to maintain my cars."
__label__3	This restaurant serve really traditional Chinese food. The food tasted wonderful. If you wanna try really spicy and traditional Chinese food this will be a good place. However, the restaurant is small and the food didn't serve fast enough. So if you don't wanna wait then order take out. Also... I m wondering why they don't serve WHITE RICE with the order. I think WHITE rice is the most important thing for a Chinese restaurant  that's why I only give three star.
__label__3	"For being stuck in the an obscure part of the New Orleans suburbs / warehouse kind of area, it's not a bad place.  They brew their own beer (kudos), but it's not much to write home about.

I had the rotisserie chicken, which was very flavorful and well prepared.  The sides were weak - again, not bad, but not great.

Overall, a good option in you're in Elmwood, particularly for those staying at one of the hotels nearby."
__label__3	They don't check everyone's id's. i was the only one thar was carded. Flattering and annoying all in one :)
__label__3	I have visited this location twice. The products that I have purchased have been of acceptable quality (cupcakes and cake) but far from outstanding. Comments about the icing by previous reviewers are spot on - very heavy and overly sweet. The counter service that I received both times was poor, bordering on rude. I debated on giving a 2 star review. I doubt that I will return.
__label__3	"I was here for the Circle City Classic Cabaret concert. I liked the smaller venue I felt closer to the entertainer and enjoyed the show. Good sound and not any performance issues from my side as the audience. 

I did not like that the bathrooms were small and there wasn't a bathroom to use on the 200 level since the one outside the 100 level was packed. 

The bartenders at the bar I visited were slow because there was only 1 register so one had to ring up drinks while they were trying to both make drinks to shorten the line. They should have each had a register."
__label__3	If you want some real good hot chicken, go to Bolton's or Party Fowl. I ate here last night with my friends because of the new location which is just down the street from our apartment. Mild usually does nothing for me and I have liked medium at both Bolton's and Party Fowl. I ordered medium, but I really think they gave me mild. I was really underwhelmed and disappointed unfortunately. I am eating the leftovers with some Valentina hot sauce and it is amazing!!! Their sides are delicious, though.
__label__3	I went to Bricktop's for breakfast one late morning on a Sunday. I decided to go to this restaurant because it looked like a classy place and  I've heard good things. I ordered the chicken and waffles. The waffle was amazing which, how hard is it to make a waffle? However, the chicken was extremely greasy. I didn't think a restaurant open for breakfast this expensive would serve chicken to that extreme grease. For the portion size and quality it is not worth the price of admission. Their are way more options around Nashville and downtown to chose from.
__label__3	Decent food at a good price. Usually very fast drive-thru service and friendly staff.
__label__3	We waited a while for a table and the hostess was pretty rude, but once we got seated we had the best server and yummy food. We ordered the trio special of jumbalaya, red beans and rice, and gumbo, we got crawfish, and brisket. The only meal we wouldn't order again was the brisket. It was stew like with cooked celery and carrots (we prefer bbq style). Overall good experience on Bourbon!
__label__3	The food here is amazing but the customer service is complete garbage. They'll give you water and not be back for half an hour. Take your order and then you'll wait for your drinks for another 30 minutes and when you ask about them they just walk off. Disappointed but food was good. Hints why I gave it a 3 star.
__label__3	Blue Plate Diner offers good service, but the food and the drink are wildly overpriced for what you get.  They need to lower prices quite a bit if they want to encourage steady trade throughout the day.
__label__3	"I have eaten here several times, and I'd say the food was decent.  Being a cuban american, I'd say the food isn't 100% authentic, but it's closer than the ""cuban"" places in Philly.  

The Yuca Frita is probably one of the best things on the menu, and the Churrasco Steak was also good."
__label__3	The pizza here leans more towards the thin-crust variety, with a sweeter marinara sauce. This place is good but it's a hard pass for me going out of my way to come here. It's very very small with limited seating-- I feel like it's a place where you grab a quick slice if you live in the neighborhood.
__label__3	It was fair. WAs not what I expected at all. Food was okay. I got arroz on pollo and empanadas. Not the best I've had but very reasonable. Also went for takeout.
__label__3	The service at this place is unbelievably slow. There was one person ahead of me, and I waited nearly an hour before being called. There were 4 stylists present, but at any given time only 2 were cutting hair. On a positive note my stylist Savannah was very nice and did a great job.
__label__3	the food is mediocre, nothing special. dumplings were dry, fatty and sweet and the duck noodles were overly sweet. Let down my expectations for chinese food
__label__3	"I don't really dig on hoagies. My husband thought for sure I'd be impressed with Primo's. To me, they tasted like every other hoagie I've ever eaten. He, on the other hand, was happy as a clam when he finished eating. 

I guess I can compliment them by saying I didn't NOT like anything?"
__label__3	I found the gyro and rice to be very bland. The cucumber/onion and Tabouli salad was pretty good. Other than that, I was disappointed overall.
__label__3	A smart eatery with a couple rough edges. Menu is well Balanced and tasty with great flavours. Geared more to an adult evening. Wine selection is good. Location and vibe is good
__label__3	Dunkin' Donuts is what it is. I like the bagels and donuts here more than Starbucks stuff but the coffee is not as good. This particular store is right across from the medical center and is pretty convenient for if you are stopping by the hospital or visiting the village at Vanderbilt.
__label__3	Ummmm. I'm pretty sure it was ham (not bacon) in my Zacatecas burro. Def not my favorite offering here. Salsas & tortillas get 2 thumbs up.
__label__3	"This is about average for a California Pizza Kitchen.  The food is OK, nothing special and the service was good to above average.  It is not fine dining but it OK. 

I'll go back when I'm in the mood."
__label__3	"Great place to eat.
Good atmosphere, good service.
Been here three times already.
Love coming for lunch to avoid crowd.
One of usuals to go to when i am in STL."
__label__3	good steaks, fast service, consistent quality
__label__3	Friendly staff.  Clean room.  A little outdated but you cannot beat the price.  Hotwire saves you $100.00 off the actual price.  Definitely worth it.
__label__3	The ramen was excellent...dense and complex bone broth.  Service was very good also on a slow Tuesday night.  The 3 stars are simply because of the poor value.  The bowls were smallish, and were still $15!  Other area ramen places in Wayne, Phoenixville, etc. are just as good but at least a couple bucks cheaper, and the bowls are more substantial.  You might pull this off in philly at the other locations, but not in Paoli.
__label__3	"At first I thought I might have an issue because I couldn't have POD delivered on date I needed to the new place. I had already paid people to show up on that date to unload the POD and taken off work. I did have to call about three times to finally get someone to look into the 'mess' and tell me they would pick up POD on the day I needed picked up. 

My complaint is someone should have warned me in advance about the particular day being an exceptionally busy one and had me book pick up then.  Otherwise the service was great."
__label__3	Used to be better, not sure what happened?  Seems like the ingredients are cheaper???
__label__3	"I struggled with this review. The place is a nice space small bar with seating around the bar and in the back. It was pretty obvious by the behavior of the bartender that this is kind of a locals only spot. She spent a lot of time on her phone, talking to regulars including getting a neck massage from one. When we were served drinks and thanked her she did not reply and walked away after throwing down our updated tab on the bar. Just fly kind of frustrated and annoyed.

We got a 6 pack and roast beef sandwiches to go. Sandwich is really good. I doubt we will return."
__label__3	They made my burger just right!  Sad for the fries.... They just can't hold a torch to the burger! They were delicious, but the burger. .... YUM YUM! Seating was available at 1245. But limited so the wait was so long. But the parking. Or lack there of. The parking is the reason for such low score.
__label__3	Food was mediocre at best. Nothing stood out that would want me to come back. Menu was short and pricey
__label__3	I went to biscuits love around 2 on Saturday.  I had the  bonuts. The bonuts was OK.  I would try them again.  The service was great and fast.
__label__3	I will keep this short. Never a good idea to get your nails done at a spa. I should have gone to my usual nail salon to get my nails done, but I just moved and this place was close. My nails chipped after three days and I cannot go back to get touched up, because they are renovating the place. I am going on vacation, and just spent $90 there for toes and fingernails and I shouldn't have to spend any more money on something that should have lasted through my vacation. Very disappointed and will never go back there.
__label__3	It was ok not sure why so many people wait in line. The pancake however was really good. the bread they used on the benedicts was stail. The bloody Mary was good too. With so many breakfast options in new Orleans I would be hard pressed to come back soon.
__label__3	Caught this place on a brewery tour with co-workers.  Nice upscale feel, friendly group of people.  I'll have to stop back fresh to re-assess as it was the third place on the tour and I had already drank too much and my palate was worn out!
__label__3	"Pretty decent if not expensive.  The louis salad was pretty great.  I was skeptical about the ""generous"" portions of crab and shrimp, but to my surprise there was quite a lot of it.  Plus the staff was really nice explaining everything.

The pan roast was really good, if not a bit small.  I had some hotel vouchers, so I didn't fork out the dough, but I can see it adding up to a pretty pricey lunch."
__label__3	Ordered through GrubHub.  Order consisted of 2 Super Smash Cheeseburger, and a Super Smash Jalapeno Bacon Cheeseburger along with fries, onion rings, and 3 Sprites.  The flavor of the burgers weren't bad but how the hell you gonna leave off the top bun on one of the burgers!?
__label__3	"I had the chicken kabob, which was a little too dry in my opinion. But their dessert, kunefe, was excellent and pretty big so you may want to share that with another person.

Overall, it was a good experience. I only gave it 3 stars because the price was too high compared to other Mediterranean restaurants I've been to."
__label__3	"My experience at the Louis Armstrong New Orleans Airport was pretty good as it's a new facility with plenty of seating and clean washrooms, however, the sunlight streaming in through the floor to ceiling windows is far too intense! Whether you're sitting at one of the restaurants or in the general seating area the sun is blinding.
Even in the washrooms you can't see yourself as the light bounces off the mirrors. I know it's a new airport so hopefully sun shades will be installed to help cut down on the squinting. Never thought I'd need sunscreen inside the airport!"
__label__3	Nice view, nice room. That's about it. I don't like forced valet. That means you have to tip them when you just want to grab an item out of your car. Rough night because the club downstairs shook the walls till 2am. Woke up to a great view but no hot water.. Maybe you'll luck out but we wouldn't stay here again.
__label__3	I think the prices are fairly reasonable for Center City. Complaints are 1) the place always smells like dead fish when you walk in. A sushi restaurant should never have a fish smell permeating the restaurant. 2) Problems communicating. I asked if the sushi rolls contain whole fish pieces or little minced pieces and they could not understand me. 3) sushi rolls constantly fall apart because they're cut on one side. They're not actually rolls.  They're like strips trying to be rolls.   When you pick up the sushi roll it unrolls into a sushi strip.
__label__3	A lot of my friends like coming here for the hibachi experience. I think the food is alright and not super authentic but it's a fun experience. As Abby (another reviewer) has said, they come out with a gong for your birthday so you can get the full attention of the room! Their prices are reasonable and it is a fun place to go with a group but I would recommend making a reservation ahead of time or it could be a long wait!
__label__3	"I thought it was a little overpriced on an oil change, but apparently that is because they do ""full-service"". Got my car back and the fluids weren't topped off, nor the tires rotated. My dad went in a couple weeks after with a coupon and still ended up paying more than at the dealership. Probably not the best place to get an oil change!"
__label__3	"Food is fresh, and tasty, but the service is the worst. They are totally incapable of handling lunch time during a not so crowded sunday noon.
The beverages machine is out of many beverages, zero coke to name one. They didn't get more than half my order right, and i was the only customer in line"
__label__3	"They are good enough for a brunch! A decent choice of food to choose and the flavour is not so spicy. That's good for me because I cannot handle spicy food. The restaurant looks really nice, but the price is appropriate: $17/2 ppl, after tax! 
I wish They can have some music like jazz to make it better!"
__label__3	"I set out looking for Pita Pocket on 16th but stumbled into this one first.

Nice cheap quick pitas with veggie options made pretty quickly. Nothing to special but not too bad either. Mmmm... falafel."
__label__3	The sushi was actually really tasty. The problem was the tiny rolls and the high price. There are just too many other sushi places, I will now choose over Haiku. We ordered the food to go, so no comment on the service or ambiance.
__label__3	Good was above average for bar food. Actually delicious.  Healthy portion sizes and served hot.  Problem is,  it took forever to serve.  Manager on duty comped our meal due to our wait,  which was over 45 minutes.  I'm hoping they get the bugs worked out.  This would be a really nice place.
__label__3	Lots of great beer. 50 on tab. Standard bar food. Mid city better people. Uptown is doucey college scene.  (actually compared to other major cities the beer selection is pretty poor.  good beer selection in comparison to the rest of NOLA though which is a pretty poor beer town)
__label__3	I will echo many of the previous reviews in stating that our experience here was quite fancy and elegant! We enjoyed the classy atmosphere, good service, and harp entertainment during our meal. However, the drawback (and consequently, the 3 yelp stars) is the result of OK quality sandwiches and petit desserts that came at a very steep price and a $20 surcharge per additional guest for sharing. The special teas were enjoyable and we loved the beautiful tableware and teapots.
__label__3	"I found this place to be a very clean and well stocked store, the selection is of some of the best pet food available.  since I do not live in this area it would be a good stop for those nearby.

the staff is very nice and willing to help out with any questions you may have,  you will need to visit there fresh/frozen pet food area,  a good selection.

this mall is very pet friendly."
__label__3	Decent service, bussing could be more prompt, best part of the meal was the rosemary steak sauce, overall not a terrific meal
__label__3	It was ok. Nothing that made me feel like I wanted to go back. Plus is can be on healthy side if you choose right. Open kitchen concept is cool but makes it very noisy.
__label__3	Very, very friendly and efficient wait staff! Food was good, not great, just good (way too salty). The ambiance is exactly what the name says. If you like hanging out at a local marina this place is for you. The outdoor area is dog-friendly and our dog loved it there (he saw a dolphin swim right up to the dock).
__label__3	I love shake shacks burgers and milkshakes. I wasn't a fan of the chicken sandwich as it was pretty greasy. Also I got cheese fries a couple times and once they had a good amount and the second time they were soaked in cheese and very soggy and hard to eat. I think the food is way overpriced and should have kids meals. Although, I really do love the burgers and milkshakes are delicious.
__label__3	Good family centric bowling facility hidden in the basement. Lots of fun 10 pin only.  Very kid friendly with bumpers and ball ramps.  Hosted a family party with private rooms for these types of events.
__label__3	They got us our food really quickly and it was decent. If you've been to BK before then you already know the quality of what you're getting, the selling point of this one was just the fact that they cranked out our food quick.
__label__3	I know this isn't the greatest mall, but I still enjoy shopping here. There's a Macy's here that I often frequent to. There's a few kiosks, Pac Sun, Victoria's Secret, clothing stores, a food court, and a bunch of other little stores. I like that it's an indoor mall. So it's good to escape the heat and browse around with a nice frozen drink.
__label__3	Restaurant looks dirty, everywhere are feeling greasy. Attendant busy, no one to clean up the table for a long time. We waited long time for our meal.
__label__3	"Love the decor! This place has potential. Great location and fun vibe. But the food was so-so. I had the carnitas taco. They were good, but not great. Not a lot of meat and it could've benefited with some cilantro. The accompanied rice and beans tasted like they came out of a can or jar, not freshly made by a chef. Chips were ok; salsa had a nice flavor. 
Up the cooking and use fresh ingredients, and you'll have a winner."
__label__3	Haven't had a chance to bring my car in because no one is ever available. I made two separate appointments and each was canceled due to being short handed. Bad communication as well. If i make an appointment a week in advance, it'd nice to know if they're short handed so i can cancel and find somewhere else instead of waiting only for it to be canceled.
__label__3	"Coffee ""bar"" - great idea! Choose your own flavors; cold brew and hot options. Coffee ice cubes to add. Very cool. Got the egg & cheese bagel sandwich. Bagel was fine. Nothing special. Egg tasted microwaved and may be powder. Could have been much better, especially at price point. The staff is super friendly"
__label__3	The rooms are big, but not worth it. The walls are super thin, so if you're okay with waking up cause of neighbors playing super loud music then having to fall asleep to the sound of the train and bars then you'll be fine.
__label__3	You get a lot of food for a great price. The interior of the restaurant is beautiful. Quite busy as well.
__label__3	Entrusted my 2 male dogs to board them while we were on far away vacation. Our flight departed from Philadelphia. We dropped off our doggies knowing they will be okay. Upon arrival from our trip, we picked them up and know that they enjoyed their stay but they were excited to see us more than hanging out with the other dogs. Smiley!
__label__3	ACME I felt was a bit over rated.  Probably because I built my hopes up so high for this place and left with only a satisfactory feeling.  The food was good, but good is the baseline for cuisine in New Orleans.  The staff was extremely thorough and the line to get a table was not nearly as long as it looked.
__label__3	"On the spur of the moment I walked in here for a  mani-pedi  just before christmas whilst visiting Santa Barbara.  I had an american nail manicure which was nicely painted on, and lasted 4 weeks without chipping. 
In general the staff here  are pleasant enough,and do a good enough job on your nails, the vibe in the salon is so-so, decor is nothing special,and for one reason or another this is  just not the kind of place where you feel you can completely relax and chill with a mag while they pretty up your nails."
__label__3	Three stars for excellent friendly service. Other than that I don't get it I've had way better fried chicken and I make better greens.
__label__3	The place is friendly enough but they are falling for the now trendy wierd beer flavors; you just don't know what to expect anymore. My IPA tasted just OK and they did not carry the one beer my partner always drank.
__label__3	"Ewe walked into theater 8 dirty dirty dirty. Fun trying to pick seats which row is less dirty. 
Someone was in their cleaning but barely. Walked out and never came back still dirty theater"
__label__3	What an adorable trinket from the past. This was a tourist stop back in the day, and it's still a lot of fun. This place may never go away, it's orange vanilla swirl is just that good. There's fresh produce outside, and you can purchase all sorts of gifts, and treats inside on a hot Florida day. I bought a little orange tree last time I was there, and gave it to my mom who killed it. Ahhh sweet memories.
__label__3	I ordered a spicy soup that included brisket, flank steak, and Vietnamese ham. The broth, the rice noodles, and the brisket were excellent. I'm not a fan of ham, but that's just personal preference.
__label__3	Ordered pizza take out couple times from here. Only pizza, always plain and margarita. Mixed feelings... some days it was very good, some days it was burnt and under-cheesed.
__label__3	I would give them 3.5 if I could. Fun , simple Cajun food, not overdone.  Awesome service, biz casual bar atmosphere.  We tried a bunch of sides and enjoyed them all, pickled veggies were good and interesting.
__label__3	It is average at best. Not worth the long drive for my husband and I. Maybe we would have liked other choices than the #5 chicken wrap. As for portion size, the wrap was huge. My hubby and I should have split one because we both wasted half of ours.
__label__3	Food was great, I had the red beans and rice. But the service was not that good. I think they need to hire more people. They wouldn't refill our drinks, and they even said there's a charge for refills as we left. That's pretty weird to charge for refills (tea/soda) at a sit-down meal.
__label__3	"The gift shop at the front is chock full of trinkets for the tourist. Some hilarious cards are a browsing treat. 

As for breakfast, large portions so loosen the belt buckle. The food is average fare, it won't blow you away but it's hearty. The triple digit weather meant inside was the right temp. Local friendly service."
__label__3	Good variety of flavors and decent quality ice cream. 5 stars for the variety of flavors and 3 stars for the ice cream taste.
__label__3	Ok nothing special like most KFC needs better cleanup and service could do lots better
__label__3	You're coming here for the crab legs. Sweet and succulent, accompanied by warm butter. It doesn't get much better. The hubs had the salmon florentine. It was meh and, if not for this entree, OS would be getting 5 stars for the 2 lbs. of crab legs I thoroughly enjoyed!
__label__3	Used to love everything here but recently the quality and consistency has changed. I ordered filete salteado three times lately and each time Ive gotten less meat and more peppers and fries. And naturally the prices have increased over the years but the skimping on the meat is a big turn off
__label__3	This gets 3 stars. 4 for food and 1 for service. Had a reservation for 6 and called to say we would be 15 minutes late due to trying to find parking. Got there and made to wait almost 30 minutes. Served fairly quickly but there seemed to be confusion on our server.  We received our food fairly promptly for 9 PM on a Friday.  Then our server disappeared.  End of story. Not sure we will go back.
__label__3	"I don't know if I've changed or the food has. The new location is great, clean and nice. Our first visit here, the waiter was more interested in being entertaining to his friends than being attentive and the food was meh.

Our last visit, the service and food was better, but I think I'm not a bread and pasta fan anymore. It's yummy, but I had unpleasant reactions to the wheat. Never had that till this last time."
__label__3	Good food. Nice folks. But SLOOOOOW .  And none of the staff seem to care about long lines.   Always a wait when I come in. Even when no one in line. It's like it's a principle with this crew!!!
__label__3	This is my second visit. Good food, good drinks, great place to hang out and relax. The guacamole and chips are on the salty side in a good way. The tacos are consistently good; make sure to hit them with the house sauce.
__label__3	They charge $3 fee if you don't spend more than $5 :/ I only wanted  a croissant and it was $2. A lady in line helped me out with a dollar since I only had 2 dollars in cash. Which was the best part ! But this fee just sucks if you don't have cash on you !
__label__3	I have tried many of the flavors and have found that across the board they lack intensity. The one exception would be the vegan pineapple, a tropical delight for the mouth. Even without competitors I find that they are not worth the visit. There are so many dessert options in Chinatown that I would rather satisfy my sweet tooth elsewhere.
__label__3	The service was good and we had an excellent waitress. The food however was disappointing. The burger was dry and not as hyped up as friends had told me. The fries were also cold and soggy. I didn't want to tell the waitress as she was very busy trying to keep up with other tables and she was new.
__label__3	"Caution: your hairline will be adjusted without asking

That being said, they have a friendly staff, it's kept clean, and has fair pricing"
__label__3	Eh. I feel Andrew Zimmern betrayed me. As much work as it took me to get here, I was expecting more. I like the set up and the variety of eateries but it was quite crowded. I know it was a weekend but I was hoping everyone would be at the beach. The highlights of this trip was the validated parking and Mariah Carey playing on the tv at Kevin Parker's Soul Food stand. I may give it another try on a weekday if I am in the area but driving 1 1/2 is too much for me.
__label__3	Writing this for the animatronics. Beautiful three stage, with Pizza Cam. Relive your old Showbiz memories. Pizza isn't very good, good games are gone. The only thing this place is worth is the wonderful condition of Mr. Munch's Make Believe Band.
__label__3	"We went on a Friday night and the place was full, but even so there was only a 20 minute wait. 
The service was ... Hit and miss. I don't want to rip on our server too much because our server was obviously trying but just not hitting the mark. The food was Ok, but I don't believe I'll be back. It just wasn't great."
__label__3	We decided to dine here for our anniversary dinner, after we saw it reviewed in the newspaper around the time of the Accenture Match Play. The entrees are just under $20. We had the prime rib and meat loaf. Both dishes were good but there was nothing really excellent that stood out. Also the whole restaurant was pretty dead for 7pm on a Saturday night.
__label__3	Disappointing. The frozen drinks had zero flavor. Salsa was sub par-- very liquid-y. The chimichanga was good (steak). Tacos were just okay.
__label__3	Food is great...service not so much. Great margs! But the serving staff is hit or miss. The guy behind the bar sucks and when he forgets to put in your order he gets an attitude. So seriously good is great but go in understanding service blows! I love around the corner so we've tried 3 times now and same every time!
__label__3	"i liked the store and they had just what i needed and one of the workers was really nice. i am a young person in my teens and the cashier was giving my chage and puttin stuff in bags but then she started talking to me like i was five like, she counted the change
for me, i can do the math. then she told me how to hold the bag so i started getting pissed off in my mind like im not 5
years old. her name was cindy give her a shoutout from me. fuk u cindy"
__label__3	Middle of the road... average prices and average food. Best drinks at la encantada, though.
__label__3	"3 stars for the buffet and the price.

Honestly you pay for what you get. Cheap buffet with mediocre food, nothing very special about it, not bad either. Good to have when you're really hungry or back from the gym.

They have both cooked and raw buffet, where you make your own bowl with raw meat and other various sauces/vegetable and the chef will cook it in front of you. The service is normal.

Good place to go if you are starving or in a rush."
__label__3	"This is a unique experience and one that I would recommend to anyone visiting Santa Barbara. We went twice and had enough items that we felt like we got a good taste of everything. 

Having said all of that, I have to admit Super Rica does not live up to the hype. The food was good but not worth standing in line for 30 minutes. I'm sorry about this because I really wanted it to be out of this world but it simply wasn't. 

My wife had the chile and onions taco and she thought it was the nuts. Other than that, this place is, unfortunately, just okay."
__label__3	"I walked in at 8:15-- no line. Meanwhile Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts was piz-zacked! People, buy your coffee from these little coffee shops instead of the huge-azz establishments!! 

The atmosphere is great, very cute. There were stylish older-ish couples sharing cranberry orange muffins and sipping on coffee and reading their newspapers. That made me happy.

The house coffee I got was strong, a little on the bitter side."
__label__3	Ok. We got the seats by the doors so we could people watch. I'd say good is just ok started with alligator - fried was good, grilled not so much. Service was ok. It wasn't overly busy so that's a sign to me. Prices were high for what you got.
__label__3	"Went there on Valentine's Day. Reservation for 8:30, didn't get seated until 9:20. Yikes...

Server was very knowledgeable and friendly, which lessened the bad taste in my mouth from the late seating. Food was flavorful and the menu was definitely unique and deep. While I thought the drinks were decent, the drink menu seemed a little too funky and unnecessarily out there.

Good meal overall, just wasn't pleased with the delayed seating. Probably just a Valentine's Day issue...I hope other have a good experience there, though!"
__label__3	Just got a chicken sandwich. It is ok. Wish it was less greasy. I thought it looked like a bah mi vietnemese hoagie but it is def not. I don't understand why the roll has to be so greasy. Over $11 for a small chicken sandwich and bottle of water.
__label__3	Always a good time to spend walking the grounds.  You definitely see some interesting hats on display.  If you are from the area, check out a national horse competition that is fun for the whole family.  Definitely check out the deep fried nutter butters.  And, their burgers were delicious.
__label__3	Great concept and overall excellent seafood at very reasonable price. Enjoyed every visit!
__label__3	"Watch out for the  Barista's if  it not their good day!  We found them to be rude and we totally rushed when ordering.  Plus on a  Saturday night around 9:30pm 2 weeks ago the Barista was rushing people out  due to clsoing at 10pm.     On a Sunday an ""older"" Barista nearly chewed us out for not ordering faster and  almost called me al iar saying my card  ""didnt have a free drink on it""  or hastily took my coupon.  SO RUDE"
__label__3	I would give it 4 stars but one of the employees here, I think she's a manager, is so rude the 3 or 4 times I've gone in and got stuck with her helping me. I'm just going to straight up ask for someone else next time. Everyone else here has been incredibly helpful! Wish the space was bigger but they do a great job with what they've got!
__label__3	I'm not sure if they were having an off day, but our visit today was disappointing. Usually we go to a different location...the pancake was black on the bottom. I turned the pancake over so it was visible that it was burnt. After we were finished the waitress asked if I wanted a box to bring it home...um no it's burnt. She didn't even apologize or offer to do anything for us. The sandwich was pretty good and so was the soup. Just a bad pancake day.
__label__3	"Good burgers. Interesting atmosphere. Service was good.
My husband loved the mac and cheese. Hasn't stopped talking about it."
__label__3	Pool closed. Been coming for a long time but starting to go down hill.  Love the rooms and atmosphere but really need to improve in some areas.
__label__3	"Had the gyro for lunch .   It was pretty good.  Wasn't amazing but really good.   

Came for dinner.. the pita and the dips were really good.  I thought the kebobs sucked.  Like really disappointed.   The beef was bland and wasn't cooked enough.  The chicken was tasteless. 

Had the chocolate mouse for dessert. That was average."
__label__3	Lower quality food than I've had before. I understand things are weird, I just don't understand why it isn't up to par if the business is still Open, you can still do a Good Job.
__label__3	"Waited too long and food was okay. It doesn't help when you see no professionalism with the staff when you are waiting, and ""hello"", I would like a refill. People talked up tacos, so we had those. Some good and some okay. Not sure if I will be back."
__label__3	Stopped by here before heading to the airport. Place was pretty busy even on a weekday so just got seated at the bar. Ordered the stuffed french toast with a side of hash browns. Found most of the food to be just okay, nothing special. Prices were decent and the service was pretty mediocre. Certainly not a bad place, but not great either.
__label__3	"Ideal if you want a latte flavored better than anything I've ever had at Starbucks and I'm speaking specifically about the Tracey Bond. Packed full of flavor and beautifully done. However I'm not sure who set the artisanal coffee prices in Nashville but it's ridiculous how much coffee of any kind is here. 

Also while I was there a girl said she'd pick backstreet boys over n'sync and I was APPALLED."
__label__3	This park is only getting three stars for just being an ok park. Things I loved about the park was the roller coasters were great!!!!! This is the only reason they are getting three stars and the only reason I would come back. BUT the park seemed dirty, the staff were mediocre and nothing sparked any joy other then the coasters. We had 2 kids under ten and most all the kids rides were shut down. This park could turn things around by training your staff to make a more memorable experience for their guest. And clean up a little.
__label__3	We heard we had to get hand grenades. So what did we do? We went to get them. We went during the day and this place was pretty low key. The options were to get it frozen or on the rocks. They said that on the rocks was stronger so we went with that. Let's just say we had a wonderful rest of the day after this! The bartenders were friendly!
__label__3	"You are so close to home and have so much potential!  Bring back the salad where I can specify what I want in it.  I miss that!  

Prices for pretzels, which I love, are a little high.  

Wings are great."
__label__3	Located in the Hoodoo lounge. We ordered the seafood gumbo and a shrimp poboy. It was 'okay'. The gumbo was tasty but a bit too salty for me. The shrimp were plenty in the sandwich,  but the bread was dry and chewy. This post deserves a 3 because the service was pleasant, attentive and hospitable.
__label__3	"I felt the need to write this after reading the other reviews. 

Our family bought a cocker here 8 years ago and we have not had any issue with our dog. He has always been healthy.  We had a great experience. Now I haven't been back since but if we were looking for another dog I would go here first.  

They are still in business so they must be doing something right. I didn't give them 5 stars because I can't speak of how they do business now and I didn't do the finance option."
__label__3	Food=AMAZING BUT Prices=RIDICULOUS .... Went there today and apparently their already absolutely over priced deli menu items went UP! SMH.... I love it here but idk who they think they are to raise their already high prices... To make things worse they are extremely stingy with wraps! 2 pieces of turkey and one piece of cheese and packed with lettuce! Really? That's all I get for 6.50?!? Too bad too because their food is always good but honestly it's not worth the ridiculous price! Done...
__label__3	I give the food and atmosphere a 4 and the service a 1.  The bartender acted as if you were interfering with his better option for a Sunday afternoon.  Flamboyant attitude is great- so long as you do your job- which is to serve all customers.
__label__3	This place is a hit or miss for me. Love their breakfast burrito & pastries, but the coffee is not my favorite. I've tried a lot on their menu and I never feel like the drinks are worth the price. However, the cafe has a nice atmosphere and the baristas are always friendly and efficient!
__label__3	they close at 10pm, i call at 9:35 to place a quick sushi pick up order and am told they arent taking orders and get hung up on. typically order here whenever i pass through the area for me and my wife, great food, but shutting down orders almost a half hour before close and hanging up on a customer is asinine.
__label__3	First, the food was delicious. However, we couldn't wait to get out because the noise level was unbearable. There has to be something that can be done about muffling the noise. We were celebrating our anniversary and we couldn't even have a conversation. Also, I found the waitress to be a little odd. When I asked if the steak came with potatoes, she said she didn't know and it was up to the chef. Thankfully, it did come with potatoes and they were very delicious but I was a little put off with that answer.
__label__3	Great dive... only one issue with the food.  They use a french roll for the burgers... the bread/meat ratio is way off! I literally had to rip pieces of the bread off. The burger itself was awesome!  Hand prepared patty full of flavor!!!  Everything else was great!! My boyfriend got the reuben and loved it. Lindsey our waitress! Omg! She is amazing!!! The only one on the floor and not stressed at all!! Relaxed atmosphere and great service, I'd recommend it.
__label__3	"The food is great.  The owner tries to rip you off and could care less if you are there or not.  I've eaten here many times and have caught him upcharging my food multiple times.  In my mind that is poor character.  I'd give the owner 1 star for his lack of customer service and crappy attitude.  I'd give the cooks and the food 5 stars.  Have you seen the ""Soup Nazi"" episode on Seinfeld?"
__label__3	Nice outside patio dining.   Food was great. Service was terrible.   Had to ask 3 different times to get our order taken and they forgot some things with dinner.   Great attitudes but just really slow service.   Otherwise a good place.   Maybe an off night????
__label__3	"Typical, large Walgreens.  Everything was as expected.

There was sufficient parking and the entry to the store was clean.  I walked straight to the aisle where I could find allergy meds.  I bought Wal-Dryl, which is the store brand anti-histamine.  Too much pollen was in the air! The product worked perfectly.  I was able to get in and out of the store easily and was soon on my way!"
__label__3	So, the food's not great. But the lunch buffet is super affordable (I think it was around $8 for all you can eat), and the service is great. So, no, the food doesn't really impress. But if you're craving a huge Chinese food buffet and want to stuff your plate, this is a good option in the Donelson area.
__label__3	Great music, not so great service. Woman working the bar on the third floor was inattentive & rude. She was smoking her vapor pen rather than waiting on customers. Would only recommend for the music & rooftop bar.
__label__3	It certainly wasn't bad...but for all the great reviews it got I was certainly expecting more. Covid strikes again?
__label__3	"Final day in Philly with the corporate meeting ended up in this chinese restaurant. As it was with a large group, could'nt order what I really wanted but the food was decent.

One negative catch was the four or five spice chicken with chinese peppers were not spicy but very salty. Hope the waitress forwarded the message to the chef as it was uneatable.

But other than that, the beef tripe and tendons, steamed veggies, chicken satay was very good.

Will try them again when in the area to order stuff I usually order and see the difference from New York Taste and Philadelphia taste."
__label__3	I'm surprised that this place has such high reviews. We sat upstairs, going up a flight of rickety stairs. We moved tables twice because both were dirty. Once they cleaned our tables, we had decent service, but the food was not the best I had in New Orleans. The oysters had so much stuff on them that they no longer tasted like oysters. Checked in with yelp to get the seafood stuffed mushrooms which were really good. The shrimp and grits was salty and would have tasted better with a garlic and lemon sauce.
__label__3	"The pizza is good especially the double dough pepperoni and white pie. that being said the place is Pretty dirty ... just get the food delivered or to go. Stick with pizza only, everything else is low quality... 
The owner should invest in a few new light bulbs,new tables and chairs (go cheap if you have to:ikea,walmart) elbow grease ... it would probably draw more people in."
__label__3	Slow, inattentive service. Even a po' boy on a half-full restaurant took 30 mins. Trying to get the attention of the waiter to pay took 30 min, too. At least the food was ok.
__label__3	An okay Italian spot in Philly. Good pasta, but unimpressive steak. While it was cooked perfectly, the meat itself tasted bland and unseasoned. What a waste of a good cut of meat.
__label__3	Food and service was very good. You gotta get the homemade chicken tenders. Kinda weird to say but the chicken tenders are unbelievable. Grilled cheese was excellent as well. Only negative is the decor, psychedelic..theme ..,,
__label__3	"Meh, okay food.  We had a nice waitress, very attentive but her co workers are extremely rude to each other..  It's very strange, at least I saw more than instance of bad behavior toward our waitress.  No team work here.

Food was high and only mildly good.  My salmon was over cooked and the crab topping was very fishy, not normal for crab.  

We've been here one other time, so not frequent and not in our future."
__label__3	I had the steak melt w fries what a mistake. It tasted like a hamburger patty from $1 tree. I've had some of the other sandwiches they were far superior. The service was good but that particular sandwich was blah the cheese tried to save it but it was to much to overcome. The fries were good though.
__label__3	Good happy hour specials good food service at times slow
__label__3	"Customer service was great, but food was lacking. 

Tried them yesterday for takeout, and was disappointed in my General Tso lunch special for $9.95.  Doesn't look like General Tso's Chicken...did I get someone else's lunch special?  Chicken was good, but it was bathed in a sweet and sour sauce and instead of rice, there were canned vegetables.   Egg roll was sad.  Will try again, if I am in the area."
__label__3	On way back from shore my b.f. suggests we stop by Rosie's as I wanted some fresh produce. I did enjoy the experience but could have been better as I almost spent $50 and never a thank you!!! And he spent $15, I find this so rude as that was alot I spent, then only to come home and find a couple of the lil cucumbers were rotten and one was the end pc rotted, cashier should have throw this out. So needless to say, I would not run back here and try one of the other farms.
__label__3	It's ok . The cocktail was pretty overly sweet and watered down . The food was like an expensive of Chang's. Super annoying waiter
__label__3	Would have been a 5 except they left screws on my garage floor and driveway that were sharp and would have punctured tires.  It is the little things that separate the pros from the boys.  Also did not put a lightbulb in the opener. Had to do it myself
__label__3	It was okay... I don't really understand the hype. My greens were so salty that I couldn't eat them. Everything else was edible but unremarkable.  Honestly- I feel like this is a tourist trap. One of those places that used to be really good but now lives off of the lingering fame from their hay-day and has transitioned to a corporate restaurant mentality in order to increase revenue. To each their own.
__label__3	süp is really good unless you run into your ex while ordering then it is only okay. You can make it better by pretending not to see them but it'll still ruin your good time with friends.
__label__3	Typically Chinese take out place. Inside its dreary and sad never see anyone eating there. Food good, make it fast and reasonable priced. Getting in and out of parking area the worse thing about place. Other than that I would recommend.
__label__3	Pretty good sushi. You can ask for 8 pieces and they'll accommodate. Those gigantic pieces are a pain. The rock n roll is really good. My husband likes the volcano roll. The specialty rolls are over priced. I suggest going to Wasabi in lakeview instead.
__label__3	I went to dinner here on a Friday night with my husband and his family. I was not impressed, especially considering all of the good things I've heard about Herbsaint. The food wasn't bad, it just wasn't anything special. The same with the service, nothing special. I wouldn't go back here again by choice - just wasn't good enough for the price.
__label__3	Based on the reviews, I expected to be wowed and that just didn't happen. It wasn't terrible, but I've had better. I had the Sunday 5 course tasting: I only liked 2 out of the 5 dishes served.
__label__3	"Very slow service, overpriced for how the food taste, would not recommend.
We came in on a Friday night. The restaurant is about 1/3 full, took 10minutes for the waiter to come and take our order. We had the Dehli Mixed Grill which was good, then we waited 45 minutes for the chicken tikka masala and mussel curry which was very salty and sour and not much flavor than that. On top of that, we had to pay for the rice ( shouldn't that come with the mansala?)
The portion for the food was is small too."
__label__3	This place is very cool! Great outside area and cute inside, a little dark though. Good can/draft selection but I didn't receive a cocktail menu. Food was pretty good too.
__label__3	"My husband wanted ice cream so I took to Yelp.  We were there on 5/25/18 around 8pm.
 
1 scoop costs $3.74 and 2 costs $5.75. The girls did a nice generous scoop(s) :)

The downfall occured when I went to wash my hands as they were sticky but the sink wasn't working in the bathroom... they had a sign posted... ugh/gross/get it fixed asap!"
__label__3	Used the amc app to pre purchase tickets but still had to wait in a long line to have the staff print the tickets (which was not an option from home).   Staff was friendly but seats were very stiff and old and dingy.   Theatre needs an upgrade as far as seating goes.
__label__3	Stuffed French toast magnificent proportion overwhelming but enjoyable. Atmosphere was elegant at the same time almost like being at home. Improve the coffee.
__label__3	"Let's get into the three star rating right off the bat.

Which, why do they call it ""off the bat?"" If anyone knows, please tell me immediately. Message me or send an email thanks.

The servers were a little unenthusiastic, and by a little I mean a ton. Cheer up dudes.

The food was really good...

Still wondering about the ""off the bat"" thing"
__label__3	Had the signature burrito. Healthy fresh and filling. Yum :)
__label__3	"Came to eat and play some games for a friends' birthday. The restaurant portion of the place was average. While the waitress was really nice, she didn't know much about the menu and was a little mixed up with what we were ordering. 

We decided to bowl afterwards which was okay too. The pins were on strings which was new but they kept malfunctioning which was annoying. We got through the game though. The arcade games were decently priced and the skeeball was fun!"
__label__3	A blast from the past. Traditional food based on Americana and country cooking. Mediocre considering the options of other restaurants. Service was great but food lacked any flair. The steak and eggs I had were pretty on the plate but unsatisfying on the palate. Not bad but just kind of meh. The steak had a major grizzle component and the home fries were plain cut potatoes. Coffee was good and the waitress was wonderful.
__label__3	Great service but slow. We got there at 8:30 and left at 10!  We tried 3 appetizers and they were fine, nothing amazing. The Star was the Chilean sea bass! The crust on that fish was spectacular! Every thing else was just good.
__label__3	What you expect from an airport Dunkin Donuts. I suspect the donuts are trucked in from somewhere and the coffee is good. As with all Dunkin Donuts, if you ask for sugar in your coffee, they put a ton in by default. Better to get without and just add yourself.
__label__3	The sandwich was great. Perfect bread, fresh ingredients, tangy sauce. However, the snotty server left a bad taste in my mouth. Insipid, annoyed, and unhelpful; she ruined the experience. Not to be confused with the owners, the employees were awful. Also no WIFI and horrible music left the ambiance lacking. Definitely get your food to go.
__label__3	The chicken entrée is fantastic. I got with sweet pot fries and the Mexican corn. So good. Had a few of the crushed ice margaritas.  Def a good place. Guacamole was.great as well. Seem to have a nice patio although it was 20 degrees.
__label__3	The food at this place was fine, but the service was basically non-existent. You basically gave your order and never saw your server again. If you're looking for basic breakfast with poor service, this is the place for you.
__label__3	Great lunch today... I had the turkey burger with a side of BBQ sauce. Service could be a bit faster and the waiter kept forgetting to bring us stuff. Beautiful ambience and great food.
__label__3	Was excited for this place. Disappointed. There werent many people when we got here. A table that came in way after us got their food before we did. Asked for coffee when we ordered, had to ask again for it. Sent it back, wasnt good.  Dont recommend the chicken and waffles. Breakfast sandwich was pretty good. 50min wait for food when not busy is too long.
__label__3	"Their veggie burgers are pretty solid. Kudos from a vegetarian.

Overall, though, the food tops out at ""solid"". It's not especially creative and at times dips towards mediocre. That'd be just fine if Iron Hill were a cheap and cheerful local diner, but it's kind of expensive and has pretensions to upscale-ness I'm not sure it's earned."
__label__3	Several years ago I used to live in Dogtown, within walking distance of Felixs (circa 2009). The food was amazing! Since they have moved to their larger new space (much needed larger space), it feels like the quality has gone downward. The food is much more mediocre and less memorable. They do continue to have a good local beer selection.
__label__3	Been coming through drive-inn for years--but been 2 years or so since last visit. The pork fried rice is not the same--and not real rice. Please consider serving real rice and not what appears and tastes to be a substitute.
__label__3	"Loved the view, but not the food.

The view was amazing. Sunset was beautiful. The server was great. But the food ...the food was just ok. I do not know if our food was just sitting there for way too long, but it arrived cold. Everything was cold...Maybe that affected the flavors / textures, but we did not enjoy it. Kids ate maybe only 1/4 of their burgers and told me the meat was too hard to chew (i tried it and it was cold & very dense/firm)."
__label__3	Their work is good, they make sure they are very precise but in my mind having a nice nail artist work on your nails is very important. I did not have a very nice person and she wasn't very comprehensive either. Nails were fine but not my favorite place.
__label__3	service was great. Food for me was okay. My husband really enjoyed his meal. The ambiance makes up for the okay food. Good to go for special events where ambiance is important
__label__3	I struggled to write the original review, harsh criticism can really hurt a business but I also desire to raise my honest opinion for the betterment of an establishment and Yelp! This Chef/Owner cares.  Despite my criticism he respectfully responded with steps he's taking to address the issues I experienced.  I've resolved to make a return trip and update the review.
__label__3	"Big, clean room with a comfortable bed. The fridge would make a super high pitched squeal when the motor kicked on that became so much of a nuisance I ended up unplugging it altogether. 

The toilet also ran incessantly and you had to jiggle the handle just so to get it to shut up. Luckily, there was a door separating the toilet and shower from the sink and rest of the room. 

The parking garage is a tight squeeze. If you have a mini van or SUV good luck.

Overall a nice place I'd stay at again."
__label__3	"The food was good as I expected. It has been awhile since I have been to a Flats so maybe they changed their policy of walking around offering to fill drinks. No one did that here even though the place was not busy (3:30 on a weekday). 

We both just went up to the counter but I don't normally need to do that at other Flats in the past ( Countryside, Oldsmar, Tyrone, East Bay). 

It's not a big deal but just something I became used to I guess."
__label__3	Parents pre-purchased ground and marker. Cost to open ground seemed very high. Disappointed in upkeep of property - especially potholes in service/access roads. Property needs attention
__label__3	"I went here only once - as it did not warrant a return visit.  (There are better Italian places nearby and not so nearby.)  But we had a nice, passable - albeit not very memorable - meal here on a cold winter night.

I had a very nice salmon dish and my (then fiance now) husband has a pasta dish with sausage and peppers.  Both were just OK.  (Mine was better than his, IMO.)  We also tried the ""wedding"" soup which was way, way too salty.

The servers were pleasant enough and attentive."
__label__3	I really wanted this place to be good.  They sat us in a room that reminded me of a cafeteria, super bright, and the tables were super tiny.  First they sat us smack dab in the middle, but I asked to be moved.  They brought my husband the wrong beer, and then took our appetizer to the wrong table where they breathed on it then decided it wasn't theirs. The food was ok, and way to expensive for the quantity.  I like a brewery to be dim, and comfty to enjoy the selection of beers and comfort food.  Oh well.
__label__3	While the airport is clean and staff is friendly, for a town that has some of the best food in the world, the airport food is awful. There is little choice and very low quality.
__label__3	Pizza isn't as good as the first time I've had it. Maybe because I asked them not to reheat it or maybe because I didn't eat it fresh. Slices were in the $4-$5 zone. Open late night.
__label__3	"I went three times for fills and pedicures.  Loved the complementary paraffin wax and stone massages.  Did not like the filing methods they use though since the file end use was too rough which was a little painful at times and left faint lines on my nails. This last time they did not fill to the edges and it keeps chipping.  

Overall I  would recommend for a pedicure but not for acrylic."
__label__3	they always say half price slush but its only certin plain slushies ugh just now checking my receipt  and i paid full price oh the fine print idk i just dont feel you really get value for your buck. food ehh definitely was not fresh
__label__3	Got the roast pork sandwich based on a list that said it was one of the best things at reading terminal... Got it with cheese and broccoli rabe, but overall it was just ok. Not bad, but nothing to write home about. Pork was not seasoned, but at least it wasn't greasy. Line and service was fast. A few seats on the side.
__label__3	Garden district, fun walk nothing really much to do but look at nice houses, came across this little spot. food looks good and ill differently come and eat here next time I'm in town, I did have the thi tea and it was so good. made it feel like I was home. the first trying it in New York feeling. so you need to try it. so when get there make sure to order that amazing drink and try the food and let me know what you think of the food. so my friends keep it tasty and let me know what you think.
__label__3	There isn't consistency in the latte that they make...i used to love their lattes and last two times it was just one ordinary drink..too sad to see the quality go down! Decreasing the stars from 5 to 3
__label__3	"Food is good. Service is sometimes slow as it was today. We had fried pickles for appetizer and I had club wrap as
Entree. It's as good. Bacon was thick and tasty. Otherwise it was
A
Little bland. A/c was a little cold for a spring day."
__label__3	Fresh, inventive but highly overpriced. We stopped in for some vegan friendly items but left feeling disappointed. The fresh juice was bitter, the fresh homemade sweetners and milk did not balance out the coffee even with a heavy serving and the cookies were blah. I was super excited at the idea but it needs a bit more balance of flavor and sweetness when you are selling the idea of health sweets.
__label__3	I agree with many of the other reviews.  Seems like the portions are smaller than expected, though the food is very good.
__label__3	"Wine flights are nice.  We had several small plates.
Crab cakes:  3.5/5
Spicy shrimp:  3/5
Pork belly corn dogs:  2/5
Cheese plate w/ 3 cheese choices:  4/5
Service:  4/5"
__label__3	"I've been here three previous times for breakfast. 
Past experiences have been very good.
Today, the food remained good as usual, however, the service was slow and unfriendly. I was disappointed by the lackluster attitude of the server."
__label__3	I came here for lunch at 2pm on a Saturday and the place was packed.  Free samples of bread with butter while you wait in line!  I ordered a tuna sandwich and it was gigantic.  It could easily have been shared and more than enough for two people, but I ate almost the entire thing myself.  I like that you can choose an apple or chips on the side.
__label__3	Good little spot to grab some mexican food.  Feels like you're eating inside a house, which I thought brought the authenticity out in the cusine.
__label__3	I had takeout from here once. The lemon chicken was quite tasty, but overall the food was just average. The menu is easily accessible online and the staff were friendly.
__label__3	The shrimp & corn grits are delicious. This a neighborhood spot, so it's a casual spot.
__label__3	"Was expecting a lot more from this place given its history. 

Service was fine, Hot Chicken was nothing special. 
It wasn't bad but I've had far better hot chicken. The flavor just wasn't there with the hotness.

Personally, I would go across the street to Subculture if I wanted better tasting hot chicken."
__label__3	"[Original review was 1 star] They seem to cater to area tourists, so quality isn't a focus since most people won't come back any way. One of the most uneven haircuts I have ever received.

FOLLOW UP 2/25/18 - The manager, Amber, asked me to come back in to correct the cut at no charge. She admitted it was not even, and did a great job to fix what she could. It looks much better. Because of this, I changed my review from 1 to 3 stars."
__label__3	"Fantastic food, service was horrible.

Great atmosphere.

Not convinced it's worth the price.

Kind of disappointed!"
__label__3	"The only time I ever go here is when I have a groupon or living social voucher. Other than that, I wouldn't waste my hard earned gas money, toll money or parking money. The soul food is average; I personally believe I just pay for the nice atmosphere and experience. Every time I've gone I have been placed in the all white room with sounds of Kem playing softly in the background.  

On to the food- I usually get the shrimp and grits or fried chicken.  Its pretty good and my waiter was always patient and helpful. Overall its a good dining experience"
__label__3	A quick easy place to get a nice family style meal. Salad, sandwiches etc.... great variety!!
__label__3	Happy hour! $5-6 ddrinks... I ordered their french only soup and it was delicious!  Perfect for the cold weather.. Sat next to the window enjoying my soup and wine.. and it was perfect... only downer was that the service was slow... Server didnt come back to let me know it was last call and never really checked on me... nonetheless, if in town, I would return for their french onion soup..
__label__3	The pizza was edible at best, I'd be more likely to go to a different pizzeria in the future. Delivery came in an average amount of time for a delivery restaurant.
__label__3	"Trust me, you don't want to go the Walmart on 38 off Cuthbert.  That place wins for the worst employees ever.

This Walmart is so much better - bigger, brighter, employees look like they can comprehend things you say to them.

Their selections for groceries and basic household items are much much better. Parking is still a little tight.

They do check your receipts, so keep it out."
__label__3	I myself enjoyed my corndog I do wish they fried a little crisper but other than pretty good I got sweet potato bread with Chile on top and the lemonade was perfect
__label__3	Good, but not great cupcake.  My favorite thing about the coconut lime cupcake was the frosting.  The cake was a little too dense for me, and it is a little pricey.  But it definitely tasted like one of the healthier cupcakes that I've ever eaten in my life.
__label__3	We have dined here twice recently. The place is a mixed bag. The happy hour specials are enjoyable and a decent value. My steak the first night had a lot of inedible fat. Mom's orange chicken tonight had a kerosene-like flavor. Nothing has been horrible and we would consider going back.
__label__3	Don't waste money on the Audio tour , just a hand held device that takes FOREVER to talk about the area you are in.
__label__3	"I've been here a few times and the quality of food depends on what you order. The steaks are excellent and perfectly cooked and seasoned. The baked sweet potato was delicious. The grilled salmon however is poorly seasoned. It was cooked nicely but it was bland. The salmon was definitely frozen. The grilled asparagus was also bland and poorly cooked. They were borderline raw and extremely tough. 

If you go here, be prepared to wait before being seated especially if it's dinner time. 

The service was nice and we did get our food in a timely manner."
__label__3	The amenities of this hotel are awesome, not to mention the perfect  location. But if you are hoping to sleep when you decide to sleep, then  look elsewhere. Between the train horns and boat horns, I was sleep deprived once I returned home. The restaurants are awesome and all of the workers were very accommodating and friendly, but I will stay somewhere else the next time I return to the NO.
__label__3	"This place gives ok hair cuts.
Very detailed work. Easy to get an appointment.

I see people mention language barrier.. I didn't experience this. I told him what I wanted and he did it, no further explanation/translation needed. 

I think the mid star rating is really due to what appears to be a groupon issue. I didn't use groupon, so I can't comment. But he did a great cut for a good price.

The place is very reasonably priced- I wouldn't bother with a groupon anyways. Just go to the salon."
__label__3	i usually have an amazing experience here, but today the service was not good. i had an appointment set, i showed up on time, and i had to wait for an hour after my appointment was scheduled. people who came in after me got serviced first. the person who did my nails is very talented but wasn't very courteous. the price is extremely high just for a fill. ($35) I want to keep coming to this place because Chi is so talented and wonderful, so i will probably end up giving it another chance..hopefully the service will be better next time!
__label__3	Trust me, I'm more than ecstatic to have a drive-in theater near me. There is some very clear room for improvement here though. The screen needs to be repainted DESPERATELY. My biggest issue with this place is the people that work here. Some staff members are incredibly unhelpful and unbothered by any concerns someone might have. Tonight, there was a girl passed out in a bathroom stall with 2 of her friends. When I told the employees in the lobby, they didn't really seem to care at all.
__label__3	"3.5 Stars

Not a single complain about the food or the service. My favorites are the rib-eye steak, filet mignon but the gold medal goes to their halibut over panroast sauce. Delish. The decor is old Nevada. I always sit in the bar area where they have a wood burning fireplace. Great place to take a date to.

Why am I not rating this higher? They are no longer open for lunch. They do not have happy hour specials at the bar. It is a bit overpriced."
__label__3	Was going to post a good review of the food, but now jaded since  they refused to take the free drink offer promised on yelp. Service generally sucks. So guess I shouldn't be surprised. But the food is good.
__label__3	"Visited again on Tuesday night. It was unbelievably crowded and they had only 1 lady to manage the entire thing. We had to wait for over 50 minutes to get our food and saw others walking out.

We have tried lunch buffet earlier, was OK and didn't have my favorite items from the menu.

After 3 visits, I had to edit my review and give it 3*"
__label__3	Was very excited to go here, there were 6 of us. Catfish was awful,  ribs were tough however the hamburger was great. Worse case get nachos or burger other than that go down town
__label__3	"The location was very nice. I wasn't the biggest fan of the food and I don't care to stand in line for my food. I thought we were going to a sit down place. 
Yet, many people seem to like it."
__label__3	This used to be my SPOT but now they don't have free WiFi so I'll being going to coffeebar. They only give an hour voucher for WiFi. The drinks are okay and they run out of pastries by mid-day but the location is nice and relaxing. I would come here for a nice coffee date but not to catch up on work.
__label__3	Super cute market. Great service and wonderful selection of items. Bit pricey... But I guess that's what the cost of convenience is.  I like that they serve mikes pies.  Saves me the trip to fresh market. Being that the only other place that sells it around south Tampa.
__label__3	"This place is smart... give adults alcohol, an opportunity to spend money, that takes major credit cards and let them run wild with in a confined space...

no wonder they're still in business, silly drunks spending money because they need the big stuffed animal at the end.

the last time i went here was high school when i didnt pay for it.. i don't think i would go if the money came out of my pocket.

theres nothing else..."
__label__3	"Ordered the Rotisserie salad for the first time. It was very meaty. It comes with chicken & pork, romaine, radicchio, Jack cheese, bacon and your choice of dressing. I chose the pepper jelly vinaigrette which was so good. 

I have eaten a several different Zea's and I find their food to be consistently of good quality. I like their thai ribs, duck empanadas and corn grits as well. Prices are about $10 - 25 per entree."
__label__3	Good hang out for watching people and surfing the web. Heavy IUPUI population. But the coffee and the sweets are worthwhile.
__label__3	Service was amazingly slow.  Staff doesn't seem aware that we actually do have planes to catch. . . Still waiting. I'm writing this while waiting . . . Wait for it . . .after 10 minutes (from time of ordering) it has arrived.  It is yummy - got the New York.  Hot dog is ok-it is a little dry.  Staff is not getting along- it is affecting their work and customer relations- management needs to step in and get some issues resolved
__label__3	"GOOD BROASTED CHICKEN!!!

Not greasy--freshly made--hot and delicious.

And they smartly give you the ranch dressing on the side with the loaded fries!! (that's the way to do it to avoid Soggy City)


Huge portions!--it's good!"
__label__3	Depends on what you order.  Some items are really good!  Others just meh!!  Corn and crab you on is always a hit!
__label__3	I have the bento plate.. with crab sushi roll crab tempura salad and soup...it was ok... it was not the best ive taste but the quantity was enough to get full...everything seemed and tasted fresh...i had take out, yet while waiting i peeped out the atmosphere, and i can say it was real nice for a intimate date...
__label__3	I had a great drink made for me as i was passing thru.. Although one of the bar managers was harrassing me about harrassing other guests.. Blah blah blah im a gust too or did you forget.. Whatever ; dubble shot bacardi limon and seltzer is on point
__label__3	Food and beverages were ok. Beignets come in orders for three. I would have been ok with just one. Decent spot but can get way overcrowded for breakfast on weekends.
__label__3	"Relatively good, relatively healthy place with wonderful service and bright ambiance.  Not ""I'm back in Nashville and need to go here"" good, but ""I'm in Nashville and want a bright, uncrowded, solid brunch"" good."
__label__3	The restaurant was very nice and staff was very friendly.  I had a single cheeseburger.  I just don't get why my wife loves the place.  There was 4 times as much lettuce as meat.  I'm not sure the patty would have weighed 3 ounces....more like 2.5.
__label__3	I mean I didn't think this place is anything special. Great for burgers, but little pricey in my opinion. The service was a tad slow but I went on Black Friday so maybe that's why? They have a huge bar area with TVs also and outside seating.
__label__3	Very nice outdoor cafe space. Live music playing all the time, which was really cool and nice. Beignets were just ok and definitely not as good as Cafe du Monde. If you want coffee or a drink this would be a nice place to stop and listen to a live band outside.
__label__3	"A busy restaurant on a great beach. You will have to wait for a table at peak times. Sitting outdoors on a sunny day is great. I only wish the food was good. The fish is usually disappointing. If you are happy with a burger or a salad and a beer, it's probably ok. 
The fish tacos were only fair. The ahi tuna sandwich was barely cooked at all.  The waitress was tired."
__label__3	"Donuts are good. Better then Dunkin Dounuts. But still best place to get donuts in Philadelphia is Federal Donuts is place to g
Coffee is ok but Wawa is better
Service is very good. 
Place is very clean. 
Little kids love it here."
__label__3	Was always a great place since they opened but have seen the service quality diminish throughout the years.  I find better service at South end of town.  Was in there fr lunch on the 20th of March 2019.  Of course it was busy so had to wait about 20min for a table.  Once seated, didn't have a server for over 10 min.  When I finally got my coffee it was  not even warm and was offered to have it microwaved!!!!  What?  I don't even microwave my coffee at home...  I would still go back but will try to avoid midtown location!!
__label__3	Good, not great....small portions...tuna app. Excellent,  Grouper just ok...Nice service
__label__3	I would like to give 3.5.. Apple martini was good. The steak and veggies were too salty for my taste.  Great ambiance.
__label__3	This used to be a book store that specialized in antique and rare books, and if you are into literary treasure hunts you won't be disappointed at The Edmonton Book Store. Lots of selection, a wide range of prices, and many different topic areas. There are books in every nook and cranny here, and a downstairs section also.
__label__3	"Cool old stuff. You'll want to look through this place for a while. Definitely worth checking out sometime! 

If you are looking for a new activity it could be the place for you."
__label__3	"Its sushi, its not the best its not the worst. 

They have a friendly staff and off street parking (The lot is across the street). 

The sushi is DROWNING in mayo based sauces though to the point of where every roll starts to taste the same... which always makes me a bit sad. 

I eat here when I'm heading to an event uptown and don't have time to go to Mikimoto's"
__label__3	Directly on Pinellas Trail.  Was open on Jan 1 when almost all other shops closed so we were able to rent some nice bikes for a very pleasant ride.  Helpful.
__label__3	i've heard alot of bad things about this place, but really all the problems that people seem to have stem from the size of the place, besides for the lack of parental supervision, it really is to small for a Chuck E. Cheese's, you could literally spit form one end of the room to the other, and yeah there are children bumping into you and almost everything is sticky, but ,you know what? that should be expected, it is a place meant for kids to go nuts, i may have had a awful time but my kid sure had fun, and that all that matters
__label__3	This place is pretty good a little pricey for the sushi... No refills on drinks except for tap water... Overall it's good sushi but it isn't the greatest...  Friendly wait staff and sushi chefs .... Don't sit on the front patio or bums will bother you
__label__3	I usually order pad Thai. It's always extremely dry. The last time it was so dry that there was no flavor. I can't go back.
__label__3	I order kimchi pancake and tofu soup  i really lime tofu soup but kimchi pancake kinda salty cuz inside kimchi is salty...and also they didn't give side dish ..only rice and soup is weird..
__label__3	I ordered a Spinach, Tomato, and Feta omelette from here and it was delicious! I would order again, I enjoy breakfast food so when I can find a good place close by I will continue to go there. Olivette Diner is one of those places. I would like to check out there lunch and dinner menu as well.
__label__3	Favorita bar down Congress! I've had a few bad experiences with some of the servers, but the great ones make up for it! Awesome shots!
__label__3	Great wings here.  I went for a bit healthier meal with the chicken wrap.   Be careful of the hot sauces. the last 3 make ruin your taste buds.
__label__3	We went to dine on Christmas eve yesterday. Food was good, but service is not. Not sure it is the festive crowd, but it seemed severely under-staffed
__label__3	Need a greasy Chinese food fix? This is your place! Yummy!
__label__3	"Definitely want to visit the place again to see if I'd make any updates to my review. I tried the milk tea here and was impressed, though the service was fairly slow. Though the place is small, it definitely has a cute vibe and I'd love to come here for an early morning breakfast (waffles) and get some work done.

I haven't tried the waffles yet, but definitely looking forward to trying them out-- I've heard good things!"
__label__3	Get the fried pickles chips appetizer. They were fantastic. For lunch I had the Mac and cheese and added the hot chicken on top. It was very, very helpful and just ok. A friend had one of the pizzas which is what I will try next time.
__label__3	I have to say my husband & I were extremely disappointed in this room for the week of June 11th - 15th.  The room itself looked great , then has a huge bathroom , but the tub area needs an update, the bed was ok, pillows not so much they were terrible,  and the air conditioning said 65 but the room temperature stayed at like 77. It was so hot while we were there too. And they don't clean rooms daily unless you ask them to. Elevators are very slow and they had 5.
__label__3	It's okay...  nearby the convention center.     If you have time, go to the orginal location in Yorba.   More food choices and more history.
__label__3	i would give it 3.5 stars.  Great atmosphere; service was excellent.  Food is 3.5 stars.  We ordered a filet and the romanian steak.  Both were fine, but not worth $50 a steak.  Sugar snap peas was delicious and the spinach was fine.  But all this for nearly $100 per person?  hmm.
__label__3	I've been here a couple of times and had no problem with the service. But today I'm not quite sure why I'm being neglected. I understand that a couple of days before the long weekend they were going to be busy. So I called the day before to schedule an appointment. I reached and picked out my color and waited for a staff to come along. After waiting about 1 hour before someone finally someone came to do my nails
__label__3	Ordered take out on a Thursday night in winter, the restaurant was empty when I stopped to get the food I ordered. I got a full rack of ribs that were the driest ribs I've ever had, the outside of the rack of ribs was hard as if it was over cooked. I'm going to try the restaurant again in the busy summer season with hopes that the quality is much better when the food turnover is higher. I love BBQ food and was really looking forward to the rack of ribs we order.
__label__3	The mac and cheese was awesome, and my burger was fine. Their fries were too salty for my taste, and the place is insanely loud.
__label__3	"We stopped in after the Cardinals game because I didn't want to pay ballpark prices during the game. This place is what I expected- average bar type atmosphere and food choices. 

Our service was outstanding. The server was very prompt in refilling drinks and frequently checked in. 

The food was okay but what I expected. The prices were better than I expected considering its proximity to the ballpark. 

I would come for drinks before or after a game but not a full meal."
__label__3	"Hands down one of the best ways to see the Santa Barbara Channel and enjoy a day of fishing. You don't need to be an expert - the crew will teach you everything you need to know. I've been with them for years.

One change is that the boat goes out for 3 hours - it's a long ride and not enough seats. It would be nice to fish for longer. Six hours of riding was not enjoyable.

If I pay for 3/4 day I expect to spend more than 2 hours fishing."
__label__3	Ok food. I've eaten here a few times and once you realize that you are paying for location and ambiance then it's not bad. Great service and view but it is a chain and that shows in food. Raw oysters had something missing.
__label__3	Great service!  Unfortunately I feel that the food didn't live up to the hype.  They have lost servers and chefs which have impacted their menu so to Covid.  Still great food and exceptional service.
__label__3	"Who goes there for the ""best price""?  Apparently, someone who doesn't know how to shop. The staff is better with selling add-ons than product knowledge...I think they hope their customer knows less than they do about the technology being sold.
Buyer go there after doing your homework about price and features.
The 3 stars is for selection of goods...that is hard to beat."
__label__3	"Service mediocre. Waiter never asked our party for another round of drinks, nor didn't refill water glasses, until we asked. 
Food mediocre. Food came out in stages. Have been to numerous places in NOLA and wasn't impressed."
__label__3	"All I have to write is their hot glazed donuts are out if this world. It's like Krispy Kreme and Dunkin Donuts had a baby! Lol

The breakfast was ok. It's a little to oily for me."
__label__3	Unfortunately, I have to say that we did not find this place very amazing. I give it 3 stars because it is cute and filling, however my friends and I have to say that the food reminded the three of us of something you would find at an elementary school cafeteria. The pasta was over cooked and everything either had too much salt or too little. However, the green beans were alright. They had bacon..anything with bacon rocks. If you live in the area, it's a good stop in and eat place, DO NOT recommend going here if just breezing through like we were.
__label__3	Not sure why this place was so packed when we visited. The crawfish we had was mushy and tiny like my pinky. Not going back.
__label__3	Bonefish like all the restaurant concepts the group owns is sadly getting tired. Grouper is not always a vaible now. The old grouper piccata was superb. The portions are small. The sauces and dishes have changed up. They are all good but not outstanding. It is what it is a chain.
__label__3	"Nice and good quality Japanese restaurant. The menu says ""Traditional"" but includes Thai Pad Thai.

I got Sushi only. Eel was good, macrel and scallops good too. Volcano roll is good, spicy and well presented.

Nice quiet place to bring a date."
__label__3	Meh. The food is hit or miss--I've found about 50/50. For example, at our most recent visit, August 2016, the gazpacho was fantastic, the burrata salad boring and the cheese too cold. The Tasmanian trout was spicy and inspired, but striped bass mediocre. If the dining experience was more enjoyable, I'd be OK with that. But the noise levels are dreadful, and I've had more amiable service at gas stations. Not worth it.
__label__3	"Fast and friendly but nothing outstanding. Nothing bad.  Portions a bit small.  Appetizers were mostly fried which was my mistake in ordering.  

A bit just a bit pricey as compared to portions.  Either charge a $1 less or give me a little more please."
__label__3	It was alright, service was odd and slow. Pho was decent, but the toppings weren't fresh. Mediocre
__label__3	Waited and hour and a half for a table which is not really the fault of the restaurant because we didn't check in on yelp when we woke up lol. Server was average and so was the food. Nothing was extraordinary or stood out. That being said it was not bad, just average. Definitely not worth waiting for. Many other options in the area that are better.
__label__3	Must try the pork sandwich and ribs . Great collards. Do not get the sauce. Meat was decent. Sides were mediocre
__label__3	Check to see if the a.c is working before even getting comfortable . Horrible experience when the a.c is broken with a full room of people .
__label__3	Didn't think the taste of the ice cream was on par with my benchmark ice cream eatery. Service good.
__label__3	This is just like any other fast food. Food isn't anything to write home about. The chicken tenders weren't that great. Tasted like they been refried or fried to long. The fries were amazing. The burger was just a plain fast food burger. I didn't expect much because of the reviews. I decided to try it though because it was one of the few restaurants on Door Dash that I could choose from. It wasn't horrible but I have ate at different Carls Jrs that were wayyyyyy better.
__label__3	Ordered the chicken tenders with buffalo and the chicken and sauce are awesome! The fries were cold and the server was really spacy. Didn't seem like she really knew what she was doing. But the food is good!
__label__3	Was 5 stars, my go to place and one stop shop. But they stopped carrying San Pelligrino in small glass bottles PLUS stopped carrying SMALL VOSS Still water in GLASS also! What's the point of going to the Greenwise when they stopped carrying novelty items..?!?! Very disappointed.
__label__3	The staff was nice, but the internet wasn't working in our room and then there was a whole debacle with the maintenance guy who thought I was just too stupid to figure out how to connect. They eventually moved our rooms but it was a mess. Also, the breakfast is $20 for the same buffet you get at most Hiltons for free.
__label__3	"OK food. Fun atmosphere. Mediocre service. Hopefully they'll improve over time. 
A specific note to the wait staff: If the kitchen is behind, and you have enough time to gossip with your fellow employees, take the time to see if you can get another brew for your customers. It increases your tips, and I saw a half dozen opportunities just looking at the tables in our immediate vicinity.
A specific note for management: If you are going to hire kids, do a better job of training them to be aware of their customers."
__label__3	I've been a few times now and have to say that a combination of menu changes and declining service have reduced the likelihood that I will return. What once was a near inspired culinary delight, it has become increasingly touristy feeling - a place business locals take out-of-towners for a taste of New Orleans that's just not as authentic as it once was.
__label__3	The sweet potato pancakes were good, but the sausage patties were subpar. They were dry, really salty, and seemed to be missing some ingredients that make really savory sausages. We came at 7am on a Tuesday morning and the dining room was half full.
__label__3	Rating as a person who is used to American IHOP. Quality of the food wasn't the greatest. But customer service was good. And everything was packaged very neatly.
__label__3	We got a deal on priceline to stay here two days for a Cards game.  Eat at Maggie's across the street and use their cheap trolley to get to the game if you do this.  I'm not sure I'd stay here if I didn't have a car available as this is not close to much.  The rooms were ok - ours overlooked the mall, meaning no sun came into the window.  if I stayed here again I'd ask to have a window facing outside.
__label__3	They get novelty points for the concept of serving meatballs as primary. We got the 4ballers in several sauces, and though mostly good, not fan of the different sauces getting mix together on the plate, some divider would have been nice. Maybe next time we'd get the sliders instead. Their banana mousse on the other hand was excellent.
__label__3	I had the cheeseburger which was an option for the lunch special. The environment was calm and clean. Unfortunately from the time I ordered it took about 40 minutes for me to get my cheeseburger and fries. The burger was very good but the fries were dry and tasted a bit old. The TV's all within eye view were showing sports so that was nice. Overall everything was good except for the wait.
__label__3	This is a pretty decent place to come to and do homework. Free wi-fi. can't complain!
__label__3	Not bad donuts, but not my favorite. The plain cake and plain yeast glazed donuts were good, but everything else was a little too soft and a little too greasy.
__label__3	There aren't many options in NoLa for non-poboy sandwiches. This is probably the best. It is a bit overpriced (I don't believe in $13 sandwiches) and the food is very heavy (vegetarians need not apply. The gambino is good, and the muffaletta is a nice interpretation. The roast beef is delicious, - but be warned- it is usually rare. Thats how I like it but I have seen others turned off. The service is painfully slow.
__label__3	Went here last night, there was no cover but a 1 drink minimum. The drinks were over priced but, the dancers were good for the most part. Wait for Tasha to go up she is really good & super nice !! Dances are expensive though $40..
__label__3	More like 2.5 stars. I'm rating the food since I use Ubereats. The food itself is decent, but its small portions and very high prices. They are trying very hard to strike a balance between quality food that will keep coming back while still trying to remain profitable. The queso dip tasted great, but had specks of chorizo. Empanadas and tacos were tasty, but very small snack-sized portions. Maybe tourists will keep the place open...
__label__3	The security is good on point over crowded hot but the last floor was the best because it was outdoors music was good in all floors
__label__3	I absolutely love this place usually I get my nails done by Mia but when I went in my last time a young lady did them. She did a beautiful job other then them being super thick and she cut me with the nail file. But it's a great place to go to.
__label__3	"A Friendly Car Wash is located on U.S. 19 across from our @Gulf_Harbors / @Gulf_Landings SouthGate @Publix Shopping Plaza. 

They offer washing & detailing for cars, trucks, SUVs & more. You can choose to purchase the automated soft-brush wash, or have their vehicles hand-serviced. 

Value packages are available, including the $16 ""Wash-n-Wax Combo"", $20 ""Royal Treatment"" and $50 ""Car Polishing Special.""

On a special note, waking up early this morning, I forgot they are Closed on Sundays,"
__label__3	"Positive: Good tasting kosher organic burgers.  There is also a large variety of other kosher meat entrees which include turkey, chicken, fish, and lamb.

Negative: Ordering time not optimal but food comes out quick.  

Overall: Great place to try great burgers if you are in the area or craving kosher meat!

Revisit:  I will definitely go again as there is no other place that offers good quality, tasty kosher burgers in Philadelphia."
__label__3	Really fun atmosphere for brunch and great service They had a Bloody Mary bar and good music playing. The veggie omelette was ok and was huge. It easily could be shared by 2 people. The eggs were a little burnt but the potatoes were really good. My cousin loved her side salad with the eggs. We also got a side of bacon, which was pretty good. Overall, there weren't many gluten free options here - so I got an omelette.
__label__3	I'm not a fan of the atmosphere at Scotty's. It feels too much like a college bar.  However, the food is usually pretty good. Service can be hit or miss.
__label__3	We chose B BBQ meal. There are 12 types meats you can choose. We tasted 6 types of them. You also can choose various seasonings and vegetable. Besides one stone pot steamed egg and tofu soup are free for every table. The taste is good but the price is a little bit expensive.
__label__3	"These theatres are definitely dated and need a facelift to catch up with the competition.
Parking is a hassle with all the construction going on.
The price of the tickets are cheap, 5.00 dollars for seniors.
The seats do not recline, and the screen and sound is not as good as other theatres.
It is a average theatre.  Probably will be back to take advantage of ticket pricing."
__label__3	"I picked up food, I didn't do the catering which seems to be their main business now.

Everything was ok.  I kept thinking about how I could have done everything better and cheaper.  It's a middle of the road bbq spot that used to be much better"
__label__3	Similar to other comments the food was just ok especially for the price and to not include drinks was really ridiculous. The home cooked fried chicken was dry and the broccoli casserole had a soured taste to it - very disappointing after setting our expectations very high
__label__3	This place is soooo much fun and can really bring out the inner kid/child in ya! My only complaint would be the pricing. It's pretty expensive to race and the races only last up to 7minutes. With this in mind, I would've given more stars had it been slightly cheaper/ more cost-friendly (for lack of better words!). I'll consider returning though; as it was fun and the staff were very friendly and helpful.
__label__3	Quite the menu really. Reminded me of the local food on the big island. And yes they serve huge portions. I ordered there fish, shrimp combo, no way could I eat the amount of food served. But it's that kinda place. Fun, and certainly hits a home run for some.
__label__3	Excellent food but awful service!  Took 20 minutes AFTER our reservation time to get a table.  Waiter wandered off often, didn't seem to care in the least about us.
__label__3	"Interesting concept, you drive into the back of this Goodwill, and they will roll a cart to your car. They even have volunteers to help unload your donations into the cart.

The volunteer who helped us, saw my Longhorns T-shirt and said to me, ""Colt McCoy"". I wasn't sure what he meant at first. He then named a few other of our past UT football players. So we chat for a few minutes on the UT Longhorns team.

He was very polite and helpful. He even opened and held the car door open for me to get back in."
__label__3	Wonderful manager doing everything in her power to correct a situation only to be screwed by the kitchen AGAIN.  Please get your kitchen staff some hair nets.
__label__3	I'm rating 3 stars because I had a pretty poor experience however, my nails look great. I called in last minute and understood that it would be a little busy. I was told to come on in. I came in and was told to sit up front, so I did. It took a half an hour for any other kind of interaction. Then after about 50 minutes I was seated at a desk, then still waited about 15 more minutes for someone to start working on my nails. The entire process after the hour plus long wait felt extremely rushed. And I was never even offered an apology.
__label__3	La Piedad was pretty good. Your standard fare Mexican, but the prices are right and the drinks are cheap. Our service was so-so, but I might go back again for lunch sometime.
__label__3	I was not impressed.  I tried the biscuit that had the pork in it... Forgot the name... Experience was not worth remembering. The food was lukewarm. Taste was nothing special. For a 10.00 biscuit I expected more. Kind of like this review... Really nothing more to say.  Probably won't be back.
__label__3	"Burgers are awesome. Great music. Smoking inside, so gross. Great live music though and outdoor seating.  Plenty of parking.  Kinda like an ""everybody knows your name"" sorta place."
__label__3	Not amazing but they filled my craving without breaking the bank and were friendly!
__label__3	This place can be a hit or miss. The burgers and floats are your safest options. It also depends on when you go. If it is really busy, the service is incredibly slow. You might see you waiter once to three times over a 2 hr period. However, if you go at the right time and order the right food, the experience is not that bad.
__label__3	Interesting selection of stuff. More of a consignment flea market than an auction scene, as Taylor W. commented, with virtually no opportunity to haggle prices - unless the concerned owner happens to be on-site.  It is a better buying venue than some, but not as exceptional as some others - but, then, in this fairly flooded market, it's worth a visit if you've exhausted, or have become bored by, the many other flea markets in the area.
__label__3	Came here when I saw all the great reviews. I eat a lot of sushi and I really wanted to love Umami, but truth is it just was just average. I have had better sushi at other places in Tampa. The sushi was fresh, the prices were decent, and they had a good selection.  It wasn't bad, it just was not 5 star worthy.
__label__3	As far as the lunch combo goes, disappointing. Most other places include soup or salad and a small portion of vegi temperas or Cali rolls but here, nothing is included so we didn't go for it. We ended up ordering a combo dish. Quality of sashimi is good. I wasn't impressed with their choices.
__label__3	"Tonight's host is wearing an ankle monitor. Keep it classy, Dunedin Brewery! 
Mediocre beer."
__label__3	"Acceptable bubble tea.

We ordered a standard milk tea with bubbles. 

The bubbles were good. The milk tea was ok, but had an odd perfume quality about it. 

We were sad that our regular go to tea spot was out of bubbles and my wife liked the pink sign here so we decided to give this a try. 

It's okay, but There are better options in Chinatown. 

We'll stick to our regular spot next time."
__label__3	Meh, this goodwill wasn't much to write home about.  The bag selection was okay, but beyond that it wasn't the best.
__label__3	Not really impressed by this place. An abundance of average food is not good substitute for high quality food (for me). Meat was really bland. Service was good
__label__3	Not very impressed with the main dishes, but the sides were wonderful.  I have to admit that I did not try the fried chicken, but my husband thought it was the best of the three entrees.  The bread was very good as were the desserts. Maybe it was high expectations I had, but not as good as expected...especially when you eat family style at almost $30 per person!
__label__3	We ate here within the first week of the restaurant's opening. The meatball appetizer was good and the drinks were very good. The pizza was nothing great. You would think given the name of the restaurant the pizza would be outstanding but it was just mediocre. They use a gas oven, not a coal fired so how good could the pizza really be?! Overall it was just okay, I'm not sure if we'll go again.
__label__3	"Large menu. I ordered grilled cheese for my daughter (she's a toddler) and when it came out it wasn't regular white bread. It had seeds.... for a toddler ""this is gross"". Needless to say, she didn't eat the food. I had the lobster roll. I didn't hate it but I didn't love it. Fries were amazing."
__label__3	We came here for my friend's birthday.  It was extremely busy.  The food was expensive but the view was wonderful.  We felt it was to busy for our server to pay attention to us but we were there more for the company of one another and the view of the beach.  If you're looking for a place with a beautiful view this is the spot.  The food is good but if it was up to me is rather just pack my own and sit on the beach and enjoy it.
__label__3	Pizza is so so, but is better than Domiho's or Pizza Slut by far. Ordering over the phone can be a strange and awkward experience, but eventually my orders end up right. I haven't tried a po' boy yet. If the po' boys are amazing I will add a star.
__label__3	Decent. Older hotel. Considering the Westin brand, I had higher expectations. Pipes whistled ALL night. AC could stand a tune-up. Rooms on 25th floor and higher are nice with a view of the Mississippi River.
__label__3	"The primary reason we went was for the corn maze. Unfortunately, it was a bit of a let down. 

The main issue was that there was seemingly no purpose to the maze. You walked in the entrance, but there's no real end or ""finish"". You just walk out of a side of the maze at a couple different places. A sign would have helpful. 

The other activities were fine, but you needed to pay extra for most of them. In the end, we didn't think it was worth the $14 per person price of admission."
__label__3	Stop here before Whole Foods to get all the brands that you love. The aisles can be a little confusing, and they are frequently out of herbs, but they often have Ben & Jerrys on sale. If you're a local be sure to get a Super Fresh card because it will save you all sorts if money, that you can then go and blow at Whole Foods.
__label__3	Nice staff . Vegetables and corn were well seasoned and tasty . Main courses - redfish and New Orleans sampler were ok-food could have arrived hotter
__label__3	For the price and reviews I was expecting better flavor from the red beans and rice. The service was good, no issues at all.
__label__3	"Very friendly staff, previous day confirmation, and operates like a family business. 

The problem was the Chrysler 200 I rented. Their cars were at another location so it take over twenty minutes to get the car. The car had a heavy smoker in it previously. After driving it for about 40 miles, the brake light came on Intermittently. I took it back the next day however, the staff didn't care to check it out. They did offer to change it for another vehicle, however, I didn't want to wait for deliver. I was offered a free upgrade at my next rental."
__label__3	black light was awesome, I enjoyed the decoration! Remember to wear white under black light!  Mini golf was fine, not much variety. While waiting, we played Hoop Fever, tried to break the high score, it was fun! l.
__label__3	A little dark & dingy out of the way place back off of Mill.  They are pretty busy, mostly blue-collar people who work out that way.  It's $7.99 for all you can eat buffet, which includes Sushi, salad, chinese food, and mongolian BBQ to order.  The place really can't be beat for the price.  Ambiance?  Not so much. Trying to impress a date?  Not so much.  Hungry and in a hurry?  You betcha!
__label__3	The food is great!!.. Good portions & tasty ingredients. My only recommendation is to eat it there and not get take out. The  take out customer service was not very pleasant. The employee didn't ask if we wanted ranch dressing or ketchup or any other condiments ( we ordered tots & onion rings) and when we signed the receipt she looked at my husband like he was crazy for not leaving a tip on a take out order.!!! My husband didn't want ask for condiments for fear of her scolding reaction to the request of condiments.
__label__3	"Beautiful setting..but
Incredibly noisy. 
Jalapeno corn muffins and oysters delicious. 
Main courses. Each served with wild rice mix I can make from a Near East box. Vegetables were gray from over cooking.
Marlin (sword fish) despite requesting medium rare was over cooked and dry. Did not finish. Table mate had over cooked pork chop. 
Appetizers were creative.
I do much better in my little kitchen.
Walked along the river after dinner. Gorgeous evening. Too bad about dinner."
__label__3	"SO MUCH FOOD, and such friendly people!

But so very, very expensive.. and call ahead. They need min. 1/2 an hour to make you a sandwich.."
__label__3	We really like going there, food is consistent, great burgers, fries, breakfast you name it. BUT, since they've reopened no one is wearing a  mask. Our server leaned over the table just like always to take our order.This never bothered us before but now it really made us uncomfortable. Until they follow CDC guidelines I doubt we'll be back. Which is really to bad since we like going there.
__label__3	Honestly not the worst Walmart. The food deduction is subpar as they have no bakery at all and not much for produce but otherwise a fairly standard Walmart.
__label__3	"a decent place to grab a beer and casual lunch or dinner. 

the burgers are very good and come with very nicely done side of fries. many of the other menu options are decent as well, but nothing spectacular. 

this place has a typical pub feel to it and it's great to just hang out with some friends and chat or watch the game. probably good that it doesn't have much competition in university city or otherwise i might have rated it lower. 

would go back if convenient, but wouldnt go back specifically FOR this place"
__label__3	Food was good, server was attentive. It would have been 5 stars except you have to walk through the 10 smokers that are at the front door. If you are seated in the back it's ok , if you are seated in the front the smoke OVERPOWERS the room.
__label__3	Service was good. The chargrilled oysters I really liked. The po'boy I got was dry, the bread looked and tasted like it was store bought. Stick to the beef PO' boy and you won't go wrong. Price was reasonable and the atmosphere Was great.
__label__3	This place definitely had a hipster atmosphere. Everything was all white, very pretty- I feel like it would be a nice place to have some coffee with friends or even have a study sesh. I like the crossaint here which tasted fresh and quite fluffy. I also had the avocado toast which wasn't my most favorite. The nuts on top definitely threw it off and they barely put any avocado on it and the egg on top was really cold considering how pricey it was.
__label__3	For what you pay for a suite and you look out the window and see the hallway out of your $300.00 a night suite.  Not happy.
__label__3	When I went here my doctor was doctor Iyer. Overall she was a decent doctor but there are a few things they could do to work on. For example every time I went there I was waiting for the doctor to come for like 75% of the time while the other 25% of the time the doctor was with me. Overall I would recommend this place but be prepared to spend a lot of time there.
__label__3	Lots of fun here but the bouncers sucked and didn't want to let me in after I paid my cover. I was able to get in and had a good night after words. Had a Long Island which is made differently. It did not taste good but it packed a punch. I always swing by this place when im on bourbon street.
__label__3	"We ate outside at lunch time. There was a ,50 upcharge for a soft tortilla instead of hard shell. A dollar was added to the lunch special in error. The special was to have rice but was delivered with beans. Our server never returned to check on us and I had to go find her to request the bill.
The chile rellenos was good, the taco bland....Based on lack of service I am unlikely to return.
Three stars is generous."
__label__3	I'm not a big seafood person... but the shrimp there? To die for! Would definitely come back again if in this area. My gf had the shrimp Mac and cheese and it was amazing! We got there and sat pretty quickly. Everyone there was so nice while helping us. The service was just a tad too slow. Also for dessert we had a cookie ice cream skillet. Not the best I've ever had but still pretty good!!
__label__3	Honestly, I don't understand what the hype is about. Waiting for nearly an hour for just a mediocre philly cheese steak...
__label__3	They were quick and had several technicians available... my technician andy was not warm ..he seemed like he was having a bad day but he was fast and didn't do a lot of talking.. the salon was clean and nicely decorated. I will be back.. Paid $30 for Gel removal and  gel manicure
__label__3	Food was ok, room OK , temperature in room only went to 76 degrees, nice soft bed,could be a better room, hotter food in room service,
__label__3	So. I LOVE their beer. I do. The beer is 5 stars. Service is good but they seem to grind through employees. The food is disappointing. The price, quality and execution varies from visit to visit. Out of a half dozen meals here, we left happy after only one. (By overpriced, I mean bar food at bistro prices. i.e. $18 for an unexeptional beyond burger with oversalted fries). Next time I get a hankering for 18th St. Brew, I'll eat at Gomez BBQ next door 1st.
__label__3	Food was okay, service was okay. If they put a little more work into those 2 areas (which make a restaurant great) they'll have a great response. The location is perfect and decor was very nicely done.
__label__3	Stay was great other than the cold showers.  Spent 3 nights and not one of us ever got a warm shower.
__label__3	Stopped into Indy for a conference and stumbled upon this place. The happy hour menu was great. Highly recommend the wings and the meatball marinara sliders. I would avoid the buffalo chicken dip as it was mostly cheese, not enough chicken, and didn't taste the best. Great spot for wings and a brew if you're in town though, especially if you just caught a Pacers game (right next door to the stadium).
__label__3	The pizza was good, but I think there are other places in Stl that offer better NY style pizza. Friendly people. I would skip getting the garlic knots. They were hard and didn't taste good. I would come back for the pizza, but wouldn't come out of my way for it.
__label__3	Decent ice-cream, and good service. I enjoyed the blackberry sorbet and the blueberry/lemon ice-cream.
__label__3	"Definitely worth a visit if you're in the area for vacation or just as a local. The tour is free, but they recommend tipping the tour guide at the end., so it is something that won't cost you very much.  

Basically a short tour through their factory where you visit their brewing tanks, bottling assembly line, lab, and bar at the end of the tour."
__label__3	I enjoyed my beer (700 level if i remember right). Food wasnt  bad either. Its a cute place to eat and have some drinks with friends!!
__label__3	Good pizza among many other options, glad they use quality ingredients. Little hilarious that they up sell the ranch ‍ I hope it is hand milked...
__label__3	*went here for brunch on sunday* the food was pretty good and the service was prompt and had no issue. The atmosphere is very hipster stylish and a lot of locals come to this spot for a bite. It's a nice and quaint place to have brunch with family or friends. Reservations are encouraged.
__label__3	The seafood was good and the service was good but I don't know if I would go back. There was no liquor, they didn't have their liquor license yet, and our drinks came in plastic cups, like I would expect a kid to get. If you look past the whole experience part, the dinner I had was pretty good.
__label__3	"Moved to the eastern edge of Broad Ripple, 1904 E. Broad Ripple Ave to be exact.

I hope they do good in the new location. It has better parking, but they will lose a lot of walk-in business....."
__label__3	"My family and I ate there and it was very ok. The food wasn't great and service was ok. My husband and son complained of upset stomachs for the remainder of the evening. I got the grouper sandwich which I usually try and get at seafood places and it was pretty over seasoned. We got the oysters for the appetizer and they were literally a clump of cooked Parmesan. 
We were in and out super quick though, that's a plus sometimes."
__label__3	"It's Panda Express, fast food Chinese food but pretty tasty if you are looking for an alternative to fast food in general.  

We are a captive audience in Vail on the Southeast side and this place is always very busy during meal times.  

We like it because the staff are always really on it, and move you through the line quickly, the food has always been solid and fresh and the place is clean."
__label__3	Had a very good meal here today. Shredded beef enchilada and chili relleno. Perhaps a bit salty. Forgot to order my margarita with no salt!
__label__3	"Three stars. they try to push the ""locally sourced"" thing, and I could certainly taste the difference in the ingredients. So although the food was good, it wasn't as awesome as the prices and portions would suggest. The vibe was also too varied. The farm-to-table aspect was mixed with a lounge feel, which was mixed with a bar feel which was mixed with a brick oven look. If they were to streamline their look a little bit, I would have been more satisfied."
__label__3	Pizza was excellent! I would have given it five stars if the restaurant hadn't been so dirty. Floors dirty,garbage over flowing and tables not cleaned or food removed from previous customers. The girl up front was talking loudly to her co-worker about personal stuff and sitting around.....just think either one of them could've taken the time to at least clean the tables.  Will go back,but take out only.
__label__3	Great spot for beer take out. They have a number of awesome varieties...just not phenomenal prices. Convenient though! Saves me a trip to Wegmans!
__label__3	"My dad ordered me the chicken strips and fries. Strips were well seasoned but portions were large. Fries lacked salt and flavor. Spit out the fry after the first bite. 
Overall decent meal, especially after a 12 hour road trip. 
Burgers looked great, but my parents wouldn't give me a bite. 

3 paws. 

Woof. 
-Ceila"
__label__3	They make you buy a $7 beer per two or three song set. It really just turned us off and encouraged us to leave. The music was good but I did not want to get drunk just to stay there.
__label__3	"Always solid breakfast at Jerry Bob's. If you grew up in West Texas and have to have that chicken fried steak and eggs every once in a while to remind you if home, then you and fill that urge. 

Nothing fancy, just good solid breakfast for a good price."
__label__3	Meh. It's grilled cheese. It didn't knock my socks off. Plus, they messed up my order twice and didn't handle that very well. There are better places to get a more satisfying sandwich in this city, so I don't plan on going back.
__label__3	I'm sure I'll be back when I need a change of scenery. If only the scenery actually included a view of the city, since it is a rooftop bar, but the wall located outside with the decor of an eagle with its wings spread blocks the city.
__label__3	"The good: clean, bright, great color selection, and a relaxing space. 
The OK: nothing special. My mani was average, the application uneven and nails sorta shapeless even though they are currently short. And using zoya should include all of zoyas products to maximize wear - at least the drying drops.
I left underwhelmed. I am still searching for a place here to replace my beloved DC nail salon. Sigh."
__label__3	It's not the biggest Marshall's in the world but it's decent enough. It's always clean in here and the employees seem pretty friendly. Like any other Marshall's the selection is hit or miss.
__label__3	"This restaurant was OK... Nice water front views... They offered their ""event"" menu which meant they removed items that took a little longer to prepare. We questioned an item we really wanted and they agreed to make it. Not a bad meal, but not as good as we expected based upon many of the other reviews."
__label__3	"Ate here twice as part of our airport experience
 Service is polite and reasonably efficient. It was slower on the quiet day.  Food is what we expected as an introduction to New Orleans and I gather the restaurant owner is  NO institution. Plates are full to overflowing. The cheese toasted sandwich was very nice and the po boy was one we had to try"
__label__3	"Not sure why I would have to pay for extra for another patty just to make it a normal sized burger? It's not like it's all that good to start with. I felt like I was eating mainly bun. 

The restroom reminds of a damp cave. The floor was slippery and everything felt sticky."
__label__3	I haven't been here in quite awhile. The kids loved in when they were small. Coloring on the table. There's a Balloon man here tonight. Tuesday $4.50 off bottles of wine with your entree. No mozzarella sticks though much to someone's chagrin. They used to be on the menu....All ages can sit in the lounge which we did but sadly discovered that there's no table coloring in the lounge. My steak sandwich was good. The wings were good. Overall good.
__label__3	"Not as good as previous visits.  Food was kinda bland with hot sauce added for flavor.
My food had obviously been nuked, the beans and rice were so hot there was actually steam coming off of them.  Enchilada's mole sauce had changed colors around the edges from the extreme heat.  It will be a long time before we go back again, if ever."
__label__3	Terrible service.  Place was half empty and yet it took 15 minutes for a server to approach our table. Took another 15 minutes to get our drinks from the bar.  Food was decent.
__label__3	Good service and nice atmosphere but wines leave much to be desired. I'm sure they will do better when their wines age a bit more.
__label__3	Poor cell reception in the hotel and area in general. The staff wasn't bad but no one mentioned to me about the club lounge. The views are great and the area seemed like it would be fun during the warmer season. My impressions about this place is in between. Some things seemed outdated while other things were modern. But for the location, I would come back.
__label__3	I don't come here often enough for lunch. I realized that today, again, as i was having a delicious turkey burger cooked on their oak burning santa maria style grill. Speaking of the grill, everything that comes off the thing is delicious - burgers, steaks, tri-tip.... all delicious!
__label__3	GrubHub and John's get me fed during the early morning hours.  They open at seven, and delivery can take a minute, but the food is always hot and comes as ordered.  The service I've encountered has always been polite and friendly.
__label__3	"better than taco bell, this place does up more authentic mexican food than willow grove is used to (rip chichis)

i'm a fan of the complimentary salsa bar which lets you sample a variety of different homemade salsas and dips. i don't remember being blown away by my entree of carne asada tacos, but free tequila mix at a byo? i'm there!"
__label__3	"LOOONG line but I expected that. Was an ok cheese steak. I feel like I've had better outside of Philly though. I need to stick to the lesser known places. They'll have that ""best damn cheese steak ever"" I bet."
__label__3	Great service,  great sides,  meat was dry dry dry.  Defeats the purpose of great bbq.  Probably won't be back.
__label__3	"Good little spot, food was decent and the beer selection was solid.  Service was a bit spotty at times but acceptable.

Nothing stood out as good or bad really, I'm glad we stopped but not pining to get back anytime soon."
__label__3	really really delicious coffee and treats here. but the staff does kind of treat you like you should already know everything about the different types of coffee and do not seem very eager to explain anything to you. also, you should prepare yourself to overhear very pretentious conversations, but it's totally worth it because the coffee is delicious and i think reasonably priced.
__label__3	"Stopped in and had the Monte Cristo Sandwich.  I used to like getting these at another chain that is no longer in business, but I have to say the one at Cheddar's is the best I've ever had. 

This location tends to get very busy, so be prepared to wait. There is a decent amount of parking though.

Try the Monte Cristo!"
__label__3	"Funky different beers...lots of saisons it seems...cider was tasty. Llts of good flight deals.
Have to try food next time."
__label__3	As to be expected at Stove and Tap. The Gay Street mule was sweeter than it should have been but alright. The spicy peanut seitan wrap was awesome- I was super impressed. Their shoe string fries are also on point (just a little too salty). The broccoli margarita with pesto was mostly marinara with dollops of pesto. Too much crust but overall good consistency.
__label__3	I have been going to this car watch for a few months now. I have a dog and his hair get everywhere. Every time there is still a lot of hair in the back of my car
__label__3	Visiting from LA, where we have some pretty good restaurants, Fork came highly recommended. It was very good, but not as good as it could have been. Decor beautiful and comfortable. Service like a finely tuned instrument. Wine good, but overpriced. Food...well some of the dishes were very imaginative, all of them, except for smoked trout caviar starter and dessert, were way too salty. A truly fine chef knows how to balance flavors. Most of the time, this just wasn't happening for me.
__label__3	I agree with the consensus that this Starbucks doesn't live up to the others in the city. The baristas there just seem so overwhelmed and confused, the poor things. I much prefer the one at 12th and Walnut, where you can find the best barista in the city, Denise!
__label__3	"The wife loves this S. Philly dive, but it's typical S. Philly  Italian fare. Expect to wait. The mussles are good and ask for plenty of bread. You can't let that broth go to waste.

Plan to be scolded by a S. Philly mother if you don't finish your plate and don't want the rest wrapped. ;)"
__label__3	Good service, and decent food.  I wouldn't say the restaurant ambiance is the greatest.  After all it is in a strip mall.  Prices are decent.
__label__3	I generally visit Dillards only at Clinique bonus time. I feel like the merchandise (particularly the clothing) is a little too spaced out and also sparse. I have better luck at Macy's and JCP. The galleria location has maybe 4 or 5 levels but not enough stock to keep it looking full... but that's kind of the Dillards look.
__label__3	Really like this place, would have like to have been seated at the time I had reserved even though it was Friday.  Attention and service were excellent and although food preparation could have been better (my husband's dish was delicious but my shrimp was raw)it is still a place to come for a good time.
__label__3	"Meh. Girl took our order and was not very friendly, she didn't smile and avoided eye contact. Got our order and the food was hot, cooked and prepared correctly. Smash burgers are okay, I mean they are good but nothing super duper special. All the while we were eating, one employee was cleaning the dining room which was fine but the incessant droning of the dang vacuum cleaner while we were trying to eat and talk was ridiculous. 
Bottom line? Food was good, albeit a little pricey. 

Management at this location needs to seriously do some employee training or moral boosting."
__label__3	I wish Tennessee has more Asian market option, I came here to check it out and see what they had. There are some option to pick from but it's not the Los Angeles California bass market I'm used too while they did have some of the basic Asian stuff there's some brands that I haven't used before. I agree the smell can be a bit overpowering but if you're looking for some Asian item they might have it here.
__label__3	"Let me start by saying the food here wasn't bad. The food here was underwhelming. The dishes were mostly rice with some sauce for flavoring and small amount of the protien that pertains to that dish. As recommended by the waitress, I ordered ""A Taste of New Orleans"" which was 3 of their dishes but in smaller portions. I don't mind paying for quality but this place was overpriced for the food they serve."
__label__3	"Not great, not bad. I will return.
I was treated with respect & the surroundings are nice.
After my other Reno Mexican restaurant experience (search my reviews), this was a pleasure."
__label__3	Such a beautiful atmosphere. Ordered the cake cup; smaller than expected and veryyy sweet. So if you like very sugary tasting dessert then this is the place for you.
__label__3	This is really more of a 3.5 stars. Looong line, and to-go orders take forever. I waited 25 minutes to order and another 20 for one order of beignets. Why three stars then? Because the coffee was decent and the beignets were totally awesome! Heavier than Cafe Du Monde, but I liked that - guess it depends on what you like, but I prefered the beignets here.
__label__3	"The service is slower than a sloth in slow-mo, but when it's busy, that's to be expected. It's the middle of Octoberfest, so you better believe it's busy!
The food is always good, though very different from the typical American version of German food.
The prices are up there, $30+ per person, but (again) remember that this is German food imported from Germany and cooked by people trained specifically.
They have a limited beer list, but they give you plenty of it."
__label__3	"I'm not a huge fan of sweets by any means, but tempted by a buy one get one free coupon I was drawn into Bonte.  As someone who isn't crazy for just any old sweet thing, I wasn't very impressed with this place.  I've had real Belgian waffles before - these are not them.  

As a person who does not ordinarily crave sweet things, I know it's good when even I want to go back for me.  This was not one of those places."
__label__3	"The flounder was cooked good , but the taste was ok. The service was a little slow, but the Owner Vicki was very accommodating she is a sweetheart. 
I will go back and taste the crab boil."
__label__3	Stayed here for a conference and it was perfect location next to the arena and in downtown. The staff was friendly and the event space was nice. However, the bed was very uncomfortable. The pillows were really cheap and super noisy when you moved. The sheets felt like cardboard and were not soft or cozy. Great price for what you're getting, especially if you're only here for a few nights. All in all, would recommend for a quick trip.
__label__3	The cheesesteaks are very meh.  Way too many onions and not enough cheese.  Also, the service isn't very friendly.  Maybe it's because I don't have the right skin color, but the people working there aren't very friendly.  Not even a smile or thank you.  The cashier took my money and placed it on the counter.
__label__3	"I was anticipating a great lunch when they said they had burnt ends available but that excitement quickly turned to great disappointment when they brought out my order. The alleged burnt ends were actually smoked chuck roast, definitely not true burnt ends. The meat had a hard outer ""burnt"" crust and was a little dry and slightly chewy. The only reason I didn't rate it lower is because the sides were good and I've had better meals here in the past, just won't order the burnt ends here again......."
__label__3	The food here alright, especially the pasta. THE RED BEANS AND RICE ARE A DISASTER. We ordered them, they took forever to come out, coming out after the rest of the food, but were COLD. We asked the waiter for a bowl of hot red beans & rice but again, he brought us cold ones. This went on/ back & forth FOUR TIMES. What the hell? The restaurant was not even busy. The waiter was just careless & lazy. Total bust.
__label__3	This place is definitely not as lively as some others in Old City.  I came here on a Sunday, and it was dead meaning just me and my friend.  I had a groupon that I had to use up so oh well.  The bartender was pretty awesome though.  He mixed us lots of drinks and tried out many concoctions on us.  I don't mind at all.  Maybe I will even go back.
__label__3	The 3 Stars is for the FRIENDLY and helpful SERVICE!  I  ordered 8 Chicken tenders,  corn and fried okra. Some of the strips were UNDER cooked and were pink inside!!! Sad, because I love the strips more than the chicken,  just never purchased form this location before.  I thought I would be safe in getting fresh chicken because it 11:00 am! One of the CLEANEST Church's I've visited, inside and out!
__label__3	This pizza smells great and looks great. But being from the North East this pizza doesn't taste like pizza from NY. It is thin crust. But that is the only thing  that in comparable. The sauce and lacks seasoning. It is ok, but it definitely needs more spice. This place is good in a bind if you want a quick slice and to move on with your day.
__label__3	This place has a great vibe. Service is outstanding, but the food is way overpriced. Had a $35+ dollar chewy Top Sirloin, should of ordered the Ribeye. I doubt I'd come back.
__label__3	Decent tours for a decent price. The drivers who are also tour guides are pretty nice. No complaints, and they run tours on a regular basis.
__label__3	Staff isn't welcoming or very friendly. However, their salsa is amazing! Not enough vegan options here.
__label__3	Hotel was friendly and accommodating. We weren't looking for something spectacular as we were only staying one night, but it was everything that we needed. Arrived late, room was clean and quiet. It is an older building but in no way was it by any means a con. WiFi worked great and the hotel was affordable. We got a pretty funky room location as our window actually looked into the conference center lobby. Overall great value if you need a place to stay for a night or two.
__label__3	Nice fun place to eat.  Beautiful restaurant.  A lot of food.  Everything was tasty and flavorful.  Service was quick and pleasant.
__label__3	"I wasn't overly impressed with the food especially given the price. I had the chicken for lunch, and it was decent but in my mind overpriced for what I received.

For our business lunch, I didn't find the environment private and felt as if everyone around us could listen to our discussion."
__label__3	Truth in advertising, this is our favorite local mexican place. Sure the food is not the best mexican we have ever had and the place is not the most appealing; however, we enjoy the food and frankly that is all that matters. The service is average but the price is more than right. We like the $6.50 lunch buffet on weekdays and enjoy the chimichangas and fajitas. Again, there are a ton of mexican choices in the metro east area but this one is ours.
__label__3	"Food tastes like...

Every other Chinese restaurant I've ever been in.  

Completely normal, average tasting Chinese food. Nice atmosphere / clean / friendly service."
__label__3	$10 for 10 minutes of eyebrow service. Nothing amazing and nothing bad. I wish they would ask what look you're going for though because I spent months growing my brows out and she basically thinned them with super high arches.
__label__3	We have liked Mulates for years when visiting NOLA.  The food is consistently good and they usually have a fun band for live music.  Each time we have been back to the city I have noticed the prices keep going up and up.  It is across the street from the convention center so it seems to me they are going for the tourist / convention group route rather than focusing on serving great food at a decent price.  There are plenty of other yummy reasonable choices in the area, so I think we are done.
__label__3	"Went to Ford garage on Sheldon rd our waiter was not very good had to wait to get service he never came by to fill our drinks. Had to go get him to get a order to go and get our check. Really needs some training.

The waiter name was Joshua time of payment was 4:26 total bill was $57:42 plus a $10:00 tip total bill was 67:42
This is the info you requested."
__label__3	Good cheesesteak, classic Philly experience. I like Geno's better.
__label__3	"I regret not having breakfast here based on everyone else's reviews. Came in super tired after a long day and i wanted to eat something healthy, which is something super difficult to find in New Orleans! I ordered the chicken spinach salad and it hit the spot. The goat cheese in the salad was fresh and yummy. 

Although I liked the salad, next time I'm in New Orleans, I'm gonna say screw the diet and order a bacon bloody with French toast from this place!!

Like the Terminator said; I'll be back."
__label__3	I used to dine here weekly before I moved out the area. They actually swapped location with another restaurant many years ago. Now they are established and considered fancy comparing the old days.  However, the food quality is not as good but the prices considered high.
__label__3	"Came here because of yelp reviews but for me, the yelp reviews disappointed. Nigiri, sushi rolls, they're all small portions and I think it's because the restaurant offers AYCE as well.

The flavors of their popular rolls were ok....ceviche, mermaid, mountain. 

Little of our the ways from downtown Reno so not sure this place is for me. 

All in all, ok food."
__label__3	Great view and an amazing wait staff. The food was just ok. Maybe better if they went with some of their amazing St. Louis barbecue
__label__3	"Food was nice but service was pretty slow even with a handful of guests. 
We ordered lettuce wraps which was pretty nice and Ma Fu Tofu which was Ok"
__label__3	"The Ruby Buffet is a good value for the price.

The buffet food is good-I never had a problem with their cleanliness or temperature of the food.

The sushi is also good with a decent variety of items to choose from."
__label__3	I had a burger and fries and man....both were DELICIOUS! But I did not feel at all welcomed or comfortable here. One other reviewer mentioned that he wondered if he were a shade too dark for service and I felt the same way. Too bad because the food is fantastic but naturally, I won't patronize again.
__label__3	Bread and oil was very tasty.  Veggies had no taste.  Crabcakes had little taste either.  Fish was good as it was topped with butter sauce and crab.  Sat outdoors on nice patio.  Service was good.  Across the street from a public beach.
__label__3	Purchased for family 2 large pizzas and order of breadsticks.  Their comment was it was ok.  Breadsticks were standard pizza dough breadsticks. Still looking for good pizza and delivery in this area after moving here 2 yrs ago.
__label__3	"good ice cream, but little pricy ( a little over $5 for a small )
went with a group of 4 and we were all satisfied with our different flavors. however, my friend's mom found a piece of hair in her ice cream, which was very unappealing."
__label__3	They'll lie to you. I was told by the pharmacist that a popular medication I was prescribed was discontinued, so I called my doctors office for an alternative. The Dr. advised me that the medication was not discontinued, and after they researched it, that Walgreens was on a credit hold with the drug manufacturer. (They didn't pay their bill) I went across the parking lot to Publix and their pharmacy filled the prescription faster, and with no issues. The pharmacist at Publix said people tell them this happens at Walgreens frequently.
__label__3	The food is alright, not really a bang for your buck though. You definitely pay for the atmosphere
__label__3	"Let me start by saying I'm not a Walmart person at all, so the fact that I like this Walmart is a huge deal for me.It's a ""Super Walmart"" with an entire grocery store added on. The clientele here is decent which actually makes it bearable to shop in. You're not surrounded 100% by the scum of the earth like in other Walmarts. It does get very crowded on the weekends so if I do grocery shop here, it's during a week night. Staff is kind of blah but I guess what do you expect."
__label__3	Its open 24/7 and a diner....and what you would expect.  Dont go there sober it takes away from ambiance.
__label__3	One of the reasons I love pho ga is because of the deep flavors of star anise, clove, and onions that flavor the chicken broth. This broth was not flavored and tasted like it was simply chicken broth. The chicken was very tender and tasty as were the noodles. After adding sufficient soy sauce and sriracha it did get more flavorful however. The spring rolls were good. Peanut a sauce was good but had no chunks of peanut that I appreciate as well.
__label__3	The food and service was meh. The portions were small and flavor was not there. Unfortunately there aren't many Chinese restaurants near the Wahooz water park, but we we ended up spending more here than if we were to pay for the over priced food at the water park. Water had no ice, and it was a hot day today. Needless to say, I won't be back.
__label__3	This was our first visit. We ordered takeout of an appetizer sampler of 5 items and a grapeleaf entree. The salads (tabouli and farouch) were excellent!  The meatless grape leaves were ok, but we didn't care for the meat ones. We ordered hummus but found the eggplant (babagaloush?) instead. We didn't like it. There was a great dessert selection!
__label__3	I really try to love this place because when they are on the food is fantastic!  When they off...super disappointing. Tonight they are way off.  Pad Thai is bland and spring rolls are like they were made yesterday.  Come on guys stay consistent and I will visit more.
__label__3	"It's a good spot,  but man I wish I had a proper Italian deli around here. 

Not sure what's so gourmet about this place. They make par sandwiches. No more no less. It's eh."
__label__3	"Food is always Fantastic. 

Poor service, very disappointed with our waitress and the Aroy Thai staff. She forgot my mom and sister dinner, so the entire family was finished eating by the time their food arrived. Lastly, I asked to order one more entree to go for my husband, and the waitress said the kitchen cannot make anything else at 8:15 pm on Black Friday (sign outside reads that kitchen closes at 8:45 pm).  Once again, very disappointing dining experience. Food, as always, was superb."
__label__3	Thoroughly average old-school Chinese buffet in an ugly strip mall.  You can get full, you probably won't get sick, but this is nothing special
__label__3	Seriously are the portion sizes getting smaller here or what?! I'm gonna leave this place still hungry again! How sad and far Qdoba has fallen. Portion sizes and terrible attitude from the employees is driving me away. Btw I ordered the bowl and it's half full.
__label__3	The food was good, the service was a bit shaky. Forgot few drinks, no big deal, we had to flag her down to place our order, when we were done and flagged her down for a few boxes she said sure then literally sat at the table across from us and starting eating with a family. Not sure if they're related, not my business but acknowledging us then sitting down right next to us was like huh? Sure we'll go back because the food was good. Just try to have patience with the servers.
__label__3	"Stopped in early on a Sunday - first to arrive.  Tried 6 different beers and all of them but one (the Doppelbock) were above average for the style. Kelly, the bartender, was friendly and attentive.

Later I ordered the Brat board. I'm not sure why I didn't send them back but the brats were burned and so dry as to be almost inedible. The pretzels were fresh and appropriately baked.

So... I might return for the beer but am less likely to return for the food."
__label__3	Came to philly Wednesday night called the bar a little after a hour and and talked to the owner who was very friendly. I told her I would tryna my hardest to make it to this place. I'm here now and I just did not feel welcomed at all. Thanks Veronica!! U should find somewhere else that makes u happy
__label__3	"The doctors are very nice and compassionate. Dr Kim saw me as a patient over a year ago. Good experience.  
Today I am here with my elderly mother for a follow up visit for  a tooth extraction. Again the front desk personnel are very curt rude and they seem to be very confused.  What's up with that?  Smile!"
__label__3	Eh. I'm Marriott platinum. I know a lot of people are, so not expecting too much extra. The check in is the bar, so hope they are not busy. And at this place, the staff has NO sense of urgency about anything!  Just happy talking along themselves, and not really concerned about anyone around. Moxy is not my favorite Marriott brand and likely won't use it again.
__label__3	"Love Famous Dave's BBQ and we always search for it when traveling.  The food was great as our waitress as great. 

Cleanliness - the women's bathroom was dirty but was cleaned up. The floor under our table was so sticky that my flip flop stuck strongly :("
__label__3	It's good, but not great.  I didn't find the food to be particularly special.  I can get better mexican style food for cheaper elsewhere.  Also, you need quite the strong stomach just to eat here without throwing up due to the decor.  It looks like someone threw up cotton candy sherbet and shit out rainbows all over the interior.  I do give the place 3 stars because they have a pretty sweet lunch special and they make their margaritas strong and tasty.
__label__3	The Sandbar has a great atmosphere and it's nice to drink outside. However their mixed drinks are crazy overpriced and while the drinks in the coconuts are fun and unique, it's a luck of the draw on the strength of the cocktail. Mine had less than a shots worth of rum and my friends drink had at least three shots in it
__label__3	"This place has all of the items you need to make sure you have good maintenance on your home.  I never came here and didn't find what I need for my home needs. 

The cashiers are always polite and friendly.  You can get help when you ask but the staff doesn't follow you around asking if they can help you like other stores.  That can be good or bad depending on what you are expecting."
__label__3	Every roll I had was flavorful and delicious. The quail egg shooters on the other hand I was not impressed with at all. It tasted more like a shot of soy sauce. The atmosphere is OK it gets very loud. Hip-hop music bumping loudly. It was more like a club. Not a place for a quiet dinner.
__label__3	My wife and I stopped in on our way home was quiet wasn't too bad looked around didn't see anything I liked my wife found a few things it's sometimes a hit or a miss at that location the parking lot is small gets filled quick but it's a nice building two levels they've changed the area around alot looks really good
__label__3	I generally do not like buffet-type Sunday brunch but you cannot beat brunch at Jackson's!  Sitting outside overlooking the water with one of their great made to order omlettes and a Bloody Mary is awesome.  Their staff has always been very nice and helpful.
__label__3	The pizza didn't do that much for me, but the crust was great and the staff was curtious.
__label__3	I would truthfully say a 3.5. 4 for atmosphere and 3 for food.  The house is super cute and great for groups but the food was just okay. I've been on 3 separate occasions and nothing was spectacular. The homemade ice cream was pretty good.
__label__3	This was always a favorite when in the Big Easy. Oh the changes. Part of the fun was the energy noise and all around fun. Didn't find any of that. And it looks like it's been taken over by some other type of management which don't understand the words friendly or smiling. Although the food is still excellent the experience was not the same.
__label__3	I was a little disappointed based on the reviews. I thought it was going to be better, nevertheless their deep fryers work just fine. Food tended to be on the greasy side of things.
__label__3	"It's darn good ice cream. I ordered a sundae with spouse like a house (malted vanilla with chocolate-covered, peanut butter-filled pretzel pieces) ice cream. 

Why only three stars if the ice cream is so good? Because I ordered a the ingredients of a regular sundae and they inexplicably charged me for a specialty sundae. That's bush league, Handel's."
__label__3	"There were too many inexperienced riders, which made it difficult to get started. As in REALLY SLOW! The ride itself was fun, but the large groups of people not being considerate of other riders made it a not as fun experience. 

Also, the line for pizza/water after the ride was too long. More efficient use of space and distribution would be great.

Nice event, glad I did it once but not sure it will happen again."
__label__3	Decent place for a sandwich.  I had the turkey, avocado, tomato sandwich and my wife and kids all had the pastrami.  It was good, but I honestly don't get all the hype.  Maybe I should try other things off the menu.
__label__3	Great place to eat! Spicy and seasoned are my go-to. But the last 2/5 times ive been there, the chicken came out under 12 mins of being seated. The sauce is fairly hot, the chicken is pretty much room temp feeling like youve been served chicken thats been sitting out for minimum an hour and just battered
__label__3	"The ""grill"" was not efficient, could not cook the meat like how I wanted on a real grill. We had to drain our hot plate due to the design of the grill. Flavors were a bit off but still good. Would I come back? If I was super craving Korean bbq then yes. I would recommend the pork belly and rib steak."
__label__3	The salon itself is very cute, welcoming and friendly. For the price though I would expect a better result. My toes were smeared by the time I got home and my manicure looks like I could have just done them myself. The massage features are nice, but nothing beyond what you could get at a normal nail salon for half the price.
__label__3	I am not a connoisseur of beignets, but they were tasty. The cafe is fun and food is served quickly. It is an open cafe so it's hot in the summertime
__label__3	"Stopped in for lunch the other day and was a bit disappointed. I ordered the beef fajitas which came out pretty tasteless. My friend ordered something which she really enjoyed but the fajitas just didn't do it for me this time. 

I have been here many times and food is always good and cheap, especially the margaritas. Certainly won't write them off my list, they just must have forgotten the S and P."
__label__3	"waaaay expensive. should have trusted yelp - way out of my price range! I was jonesing for some delicious, well-made cuban food, something I have yet to find in philly. this was delicious, and well-made, but the prices and overall swank of the restaurant were just not was I was looking for. 
great drinks, very tasty, just not my style."
__label__3	I tried this place for the second time and I was not impressed again. I was rooting for this place because I would like to see more people in this area. But it really is not that great. 3 stars for the atmosphere (drinks and music).
__label__3	Decent food but not as good as another Chinese restaurant in the area.I tried it twice just to make sure I was being fair and there is no doubt,while the food wasn't horrible,it wasn't as good as the other restaurant that's been in town for many years
__label__3	You get what you pay for and this place is inexpensive.  I've been here twice for walk in random stuff.  It's nothing outstanding but I found the employees to be extremely nice and the atmosphere inviting and very friendly.
__label__3	It's hard for me to know how to review this restaurant/tavern, which is a neighborhood gathering place. The bar is lively, and the restaurant is almost almost always full. There's no decor--formica tables, servicable chairs. The menu has traditional pub favorites (try the hot wings!), but it also has more creative additions. It's the service I struggle with. The servers act like they're doing you a huge favor to even seat you, and their attitude is really off-putting.
__label__3	went to visit my Niece while I was at Mardi Gras, Didnt get to go inside because it was mardi gras And the Security lady Rudely let me know...and then told me I had to park on the No Parking zone in the street to wait on my Nice to come out.... WTF!. So I never did get to visit the campus.... :( next time though
__label__3	"My experience here was just eh. 

All of my group's tacos (except one) were served ice-cold. My one warm taco was good, but I couldn't even eat the cold ones. 

The salsa bar was out of a few salsas and limes. A member in my group asked for limes and was told they were out. It was 6 o'clock on a Saturday so I guess everyone was out of luck that night."
__label__3	"I'm 40 so I might be a decade too old for this brand but I love the look! A friend got a summer dress on sale for $20 but of course the one that fit me was $120 

I like that they sell organic jeans but they need more selection - I struck out on the skinny jeans but would definitely get dresses or blouses if they start offering eco friendly options!"
__label__3	"I was very disappointed this morning to walk into my ""full face"" threading appointment to find out that it does not in fact include hair removal from the entire face... it's everything except eyebrows. Definitely need to specify that on the Web site. Clearly there had been confusion about this before because as soon as I sat in the chair, she asked me if I knew that eyebrows were not included in the full face price.

I decided to get services done elsewhere, but the place was pretty and Diana was very nice."
__label__3	Really love Max Brenner's chocolates so we decided to grab dessert here one night. The service was pretty horrible, and our waitress wasn't very attentive. I think I waited about 15 minutes to order as she repeatedly passed by me without asking if we needed assistance. Not a bad spot at all, just be ready for not ideal service. Lighting is a little jarring for an evening dessert spot as well, so I don't recommend taking a date here :)
__label__3	Went here straight after a conference with only 30 mins before closing. Since they only sell beignets about every other day of the week, I thought they would be superb. When I got them they were super hot and covered in yummy powdered sugar, for that alone they get a 4.5, but in the taste department they weren't that good, and for that they get a 3 out of 5.
__label__3	Enjoyed a great brunch here. Prices were good, too. Returned for dinner and another lunch but wasn't as impressed- staff seem a little distracted. However, I would return for another brunch and try it again.
__label__3	"Fine place for a quick slice but wouldn't order ""dinner"" from there. 

This place is good for a slice, especially after a long night of drinking. We wanted a nice night in and ordered a whole pie from there last night and it was extremely greasy and soggy. We also ordered a Stromboli which was basically a thin pizza crust with watery cheese on the inside."
__label__3	Total hit or miSs on food and service. We have had more hiccups then amazements. Medium well burger came out raw, waitress noted it wasn't right and never came back to the table! Twice I have had things with onions and gotten multiple bites of onion skins. There seems to be no manager presence. The recipes are not consistent with the gultch store. When the food is right it is delicious! And the drinks are normally good as well.
__label__3	Its good but not great. I don't have to have it again. I ordered the corned beef hash which to my surprise had cubed pastrami in it. Nice touch! My pouches egg was almost hard boiled but good hash. Thank God for the salt and pepper on the table because it needed it. Alittle overpriced for my taste but good location. No real need to come back. Shout out to the waitress from Fayetteville, NC. One love baby!
__label__3	Like the other reviewers said, don't bother going here for dinner. Service was horrible, manager was vacant. They do a decent breakfast but if you're going to go out to dinner, go elsewhere because for the money you can certainly get something nicer and you'll  definitely get  better service.
__label__3	Friendly service and the food was ok. I ordered the grilled veggie sandwich, one of my go to items when I eat out. The bread was good, but the sandwich didn't have enough flavor. Would've been better with goat cheese instead of mozzarella for some added flavor. Had to request the pesto sauce after the fact (wasn't one the sandwich initially as described on the menu). The sauce made the sandwich better but still wasn't great. The salad that came on the side was really good. Better than it looked.
__label__3	Good mid range business hotel. Decent breakfast with a continental buffet option. Points incentive to dine in evenings. Service at tables OK, better at the small bar. Pork tenderloin a
__label__3	Stopped in last night with another couple. Would have been more stars, but all agreed the food was way to SALTY !!! Sever (Amy) did fine. Suprised mgt didn't come by to acknowledge are concern.
__label__3	They are nice people and their food is fantastic but there food prep is terrible. Especially for takeout. My husband has to go to the restaurant to order and then they get the order wrong three times before they got it right. He has to go in there because the last several times he ordered over the phone they got the order wrong. Their patio would be heavenly if they would cover it and pick up the trash around it.
__label__3	"Food: 2
Decor: 3.5
Ambiance: 4
Service: 4.5
Value: 3

Our chef was very charismatic and personable. I greatly appreciate the work that he is able to do. However, none of the food particularly stood out for me. The hibachi experience is definitely the main reason to come here."
__label__3	Ate in the restaurant the other day.  The food was better than average, so I decided to call for delivery tonight.  Promised 30-45 minutes.  80 minutes later, I'm still waiting.  Really frustrated.
__label__3	The service was pretty good at first but quickly declined.  They stopped checking on us, then didn't bring everything we ordered, then overcharged us.  They did rectify the overcharge when we brought to their attention.   The food was ok, but not enough to bring me back considrring the customer service.
__label__3	"This is a really small museum.
We paid 17 bucks for two adults.

Really not much to see , some small sharks, fish and jelly fish."
__label__3	"Always eaten at Pats across the street.  Figured I'd give Genos a shot.  Nice steak but I've had many better.   They feature ""Freedom Fries"" too.  South Philly after all."
__label__3	"I was able to get my window fixed quickly but 10 minutes after the guy left, I was checking out everything to make sure everything still works and I noticed that now my passenger door won't open from the inside. I immediately called the technician back and not only did they not answer but my calls were sent to voicemail purposely. This is a huge headache for me anytime you are doing work for someone you should atleast check to make sure you put things back in order. I will write another review once I get in touch with someone

He cleaned my seat of the shattered glass at least"
__label__3	"well... 
Food was great and I would rate it 5 stars.
Mimosas were fantastic; we had a flt and a regular
Service was TERRIBLE to the point that was annoying and uncomfortable"
__label__3	Love this credit union but every time I come at my lunch 12pm to 1pm, there are only one or two tellers and a long line. Maybe schedule lunches around this time? Others in line with ere complaining about the same thing.
__label__3	"Had our Maltese groomed here. The lady ""trimmed"" him way to short. Not very friendly service. 
Jason the owner is very nice.
Will not return."
__label__3	"Stopped by Dairy Queen this afternoon for grilled burger specifically requested mustard on the burgers but was served ketchup instead; this mistake made me rate this Dairy Queen with low score. If someone request their food be served a certain way expectations should be met. Just saying....
I spoke with the manager yesterday who informs he will discuss with his staff the importance of making sure customers orders are correct. He also rendered his apologies for the mistake and any inconveniences. Therefore, I will change my rating of this establishment at this time."
__label__3	"Great service.  Outstanding service.  Everyone is falling over themselves to make sure you are happy.  I just wish I could offer the accolades about the food.  It's not bad, but not outstanding.  I had the Tilapia and my wife had the fish tacos.  Both were OK but were not particularly flavorful.  Just OK.  And the portions were on more of a European scale so if you are hungry, order appetizers.

The Ikea-esque furnishings were like the food.  OK but not that great.  The music was great.   And again, the service - primo."
__label__3	Tried it based on yelp reviews, but should've listened to the one bad review :/ Just meh....store bought taco shells and the rice seemed like the packaged ones you get at the grocery store. Meat was good and salsa was, too. Don't plan on coming back.
__label__3	"They are normally very efficient and appointments are very helpful and honored.  Some improvement could include doing any pending ""my sync"" updates, I had to do it myself but I'm a techy type and I don't think many people will understand the benefits.  I also noticed when I got home that there were a couple pending recalls and no one mentioned it.  I understand sometimes these need to be scheduled and parts are not aways available, but the Clint should be told what to do or expect"
__label__3	This was your typical Asian mall food. I ordered a spring roll, lo mein, orange chicken and another kind of chicken. I would go back if I ever happened to be in that mall again.
__label__3	I take my cat here for vaccines and they are cheap so I will continue to get her vaccined here. However ask for Dr. Sara and as per the recommendation of a friend of mine that used to work there: if you need more than just vaccines, such as surgery, go somewhere else. If all you need is vaccines though this is the place to go.
__label__3	Great selection of stores but unfortunately because of staff or stock a lot of stores close at 7. Also some stores are requiring masks. But a good place to shop a variety and lots of eateries in the area.
__label__3	I can't say that I personally loved it but there was technically nothing wrong with it. It's just like every other build your own pizza places with maybe some different food choices, ie calzones. What I didn't like was the spicy pizza sauce. It wasn't spicy and it had a weird sweet tastes that I couldn't stand. The restaurant itself was clean. The staff were pretty dry, not friendly but not rude. All in all it was decent but I doubt I'll visit again just because of my personal taste with the food.
__label__3	Great find! We wondered for awhile passing several restaurants and then came upon The Corner. I ordered the jambalaya Andy husband ordered the New Orleans special. His came with gumbo, red beans, shrimp creole, and jambalaya. The feel is so New Orleans! We loved it!
__label__3	I went here for a friends birthday. The food was good, waiter was nice. I'm giving them 3 stars because the waiter overcharged my credit card. He swiped my card twice. Once I contacted management, they took no responsibility for the waiter over charging me. I called multiple times asking for a refund, unfortunately I was never refunded.
__label__3	This place is over rated. The food isn't that great and service is definitely lacking. Although the scenery is great for young ones, it's nothing to write home about. This is not a place we would visit again in the future. We just weren't impressed beyond the fish tanks.
__label__3	Not bad. Servings are a bit small but the meal was good especially considering its a chain.
__label__3	I like this bakery and they do offer a lot of wonderful items. They actually make one of my very favorite cookies, along with a yummy gooey cake.  I gave a 3 star, but I really hate to say negative comments about a place, especially since it's all a matter of taste.  For me, I prefer a more authentic Ybor/Tampa Cuban Sandwich and I'd also like to find a local bakery with really great tasting cakes. So many bakeries seem to just load a cake up with so much of the icing, it over powers the cake.
__label__3	"I spent a lot of time here during the Santa Barbara Film Festival, and I thought this place was amazing. They served the tastiest ahi tuna appetizers and teriyaki salmon bites, along with some solid beer options. Unfortunately, when I returned for lunch, I discovered all that shit was just catered, and their actual meal was completely disappointing. 

Bummer."
__label__3	Newly remodeled rooms plenty of light plenty of electric outlets very nice good breakfast. Bed was very hard.
__label__3	I love the culture and history surrounding this place. The food looked awesome but the taste just wasn't there for me.  The food is just ok. Had the half and half grilled fish and shrimp with corn grits and gumbo.
__label__3	Stay was fine. Nothing special. It was clean and the restaurant is nice (pricey). The hotel has a lot of potential. It looks super appealing from the outside. The pool Is just very small. It's hard to find the area that the photos show of a beach area (we never found it). Good for a quick stay/work stay.
__label__3	The bartenders and waitstaff are very friendly.  The bar is huge and has a solid beer selection.  The food is inconsistent.  Sometimes it's really good, and other times it's not so good.
__label__3	Everything smells like urine.. the water stinks when it dries on your bathing suit like a dirty nursing home. So gross. I go often, but now I avoid the pools. They have splash pads though which are fine. Lines for food are hour long, not exaggerating, but they're working on that I heard with option fast options. The parade and shows make it worth a trip. Also bring sound headphones if you kids are sensitive to very loud cheering for the shows.
__label__3	Visited Taste when I was in St. Louis a couple of weeks ago.  I found the atmosphere cozy and warm.  Cocktails were good but I was disappointed that my Moscow Mule was served in a highball instead of a copper mug and ginger beer wasn't quite as ginger-y as it could be. Small plates are fun but be forewarned they are better described as tiny plates.  Overall the food was delicious and the churros were heavenly. Lucky for Taste I am a believer in second chances and I will be back.
__label__3	Nice environment, friendly service but not the best Korean I have ever had.  Good bulgogi, poor rice!
__label__3	"I ordered from here through Uber Eats, so I can't comment on the service.

I ordered the biscuits and gravy with home fries and scrambled eggs.  The biscuit was great; dense and crumbly without being dry.  The gravy was also good.  The sausage patties are homemade, but were very overseasoned.  They were extremely salty with an overpowering taste of garlic powder.  The potatoes and eggs were both bland.  It seemed like the scrambled eggs may have come from a carton."
__label__3	Stopped in for lunch on a Saturday and had down drink specials too. Enjoyed the Lady Luck for $6 and it was delish. Curry crab wontons were good - exactly what we expected. Next we had the Red Dragon and Zen roll. Both were good - I liked the Red Dragon more. Rolls were a little sloppy and fell apart, which is why this isn't a 4 star.
__label__3	Have a degree in quantum physics? Come to Sandbar! No, not really, but the Happy Hour is confusing and listening to the hostess explain it to new customers is becoming monotonous.  The bar is 10ft away from us,  open and yet happy hour is altered for whatever reason.  However, like the old saying goes don't go to bed angry, the atmosphere is warm and staff are friendly.  Join their mailing list for specials.  Cool place.
__label__3	I used to really like Best Buy and thought that they had good brands at reasonable prices.  Lately they seem to have lesser quality at the same price.
__label__3	"Baked gulf fish filet with crawfish ettoufee: 3.5 stars

Solid dish, the fish wasn't overcooked which was my biggest fear. Don't expect super fresh though. The sauce was good and not too salty, went well with the fish and rice.

The guy who served us was nice and accommodating, but the place is a bit dirty (food on chairs and on the floor not quite cleaned up)"
__label__3	"I like that the abbreviated name of this coronary-inducing food establishment is ""FWOT."" You wouldn't expect a fancy meal here, now would ya? Good, because you won't get it. This is FWOT, remember?

The wings are fine, as are the fries. The sauces are appropriately saucy. You'll order at the counter and pick up your tray when you're number is up.

If you eat here often, though, your number will be up sooner than you expect."
__label__3	It was ok! Nothing special! Very average. I wasn't that impressed with the food, but it wasn't awful. Nice substitute until I get time to get to Indian Garden in Yardley!!!
__label__3	Honestly, I love this place. Taste right, good environment, convenient location. Somehow, it lacks of some speciality, some tempting things to draw you back there.
__label__3	"You can't beat the location and the service was good and the beer was ""kinda"" cold. The food? Not good. This is a place to watch boats and have a drink, eat elsewhere."
__label__3	"Very clean but aged.   Went for breakfast and only had to wait seven minutes.   As soon as we were seated we were offered coffee.   
I had the lox  Benedict. Very good and plentiful
My wife had the provolone omelette and grits. Good service. Will go back again on a Friday to try the Middle Eastern food."
__label__3	Nothing healthy on the menu. Even the salads are loaded with buckets of dressing and bacon. Our waitress was adorable and her service was very good I hate those automated pads at the table they don't have the correct info and are really impersonal. .
__label__3	This is really a tourist trap. It's okay if you've never had a cheesesteak before and just want the experience.
__label__3	"It was a great place for some acoustic music during the day, cheap drinks. 
At night it got smokey so for a non smoker it wasn't enjoyable.
Overall it was a decent experience"
__label__3	Food was average.  Ordered the French Dip as it was on the specials and was definitely not wowed by it.  It was a plain dry roll with some beef and cheese.  The cheese was the best part.  Even the au jois was lacking.  I guess suits me right for not going for seafood.  Maybe that's where its at?
__label__3	18 ounce New York strip on the bone was not worth $46. I hated the fact that it was pre sliced. I'm not sure why they would do that? The bone was cut off of the rest of the meat, sitting on the plate. It also appeared to be about 4 oz shy of the 18 ounces advertised.Service was great. Food was so/so.
__label__3	Fitz's can be really good. Tonight it was not. The hostesses carried on a conversation for an uncomfortably long time before they even acknowledged our presence. My dinner companion had sucked down two cream sodas and was going for a third before my chocolate malted was served. Both the mug and the malt cup and the liquid therein were warm from sitting too long on the pass-through. The brat and the burrito were disappointing. They do a better job on the burgers, and the floats, of course.
__label__3	The bagels are absolutely delicious here and the place is always packed! The only reason I'm giving it a 3 Star is because I don't think the people that work here are very friendly. I ordered a flagel which I didn't know was additional charge on top of a bagel with cream cheese. I noticed the charge when I asked for the receipt. I would have appreciated it if I was told at the time of my purchase of the additional charge. It's not written anywhere on their menu.
__label__3	The alligator 2 ways was good. Service was friendly but slow. It was our first night so I ordered the taste of New Orleans. It wasn't bad but nothing to write home about. Overall, nothing was bad it just also wasn't AMAZING
__label__3	Had a shrimp poboy. Just average if you ask me. Shrimp weren't super flavorful and it only came with mayo. As someone who hates mayo, I was hoping for roumelade.
__label__3	Uncomfortable seating. Good selection of coffee. The service was not the friendliest and the music was pretty terrible. Good parking though.
__label__3	"We lunched there yesterday and ordered the hamburger combo for $6.95.  I asked for everything on my burger.  The burger was at least 1/2 lb and done perfectly, however, the ""everything"" they put on it consisted of lettuce and hot peppers!  No onion, no tomato, no mustard, no ketchup!  I still enjoyed the burger which was too much to finish but was a little disappointed in the lack of the usual ""everything"" I expected.  All in all a very nice restaurant and I would go back again but be more precise in my order, lol."
__label__3	Not sure what all the hype was, and is, about El Limón. After having eaten here a few times the service is mediocre and the food is average. Shrimp tacos are ok but guacamole and chips and other dishes are just blah. Not worth going out of your way.
__label__3	Staff was great but there's a few concerns as far as flavoring.  Farm salad has too much vinegar in it. It's very bitter although it's very healthy. The custard has rhubarb in it which also is a bitter flavor that doesn't work well with the custard.
__label__3	The best thing about this place was that the bar keep made my favorite breakfast wakeup call. Red Bull & OJ and only charged me for an OJ. That was awesome. As far as the food, it was sub par. They make the french toast with french bread, it was not my thing. Also the bacon was tiny. If not for the RBOJ it was a two star at best place.
__label__3	I got the mongolian beef and as someone else said the beef was tender with great flavor.  I felt my dish was drowned in onions though, just to many, more meat of course would of been better.  The portions are not very large and I thought the chow mein was quite salty.  The wasabi sauce was incredible the hottest I have ever had and the vegetable egg rolls great with it.  There was one waitress serving everyone and she did a great job.  The atmosphere of this place is very boring.
__label__3	"Although they make a good bagel they do not always have most popular ones available 
Today for example no pumpernickel, marble or whole-wheat 
Asked for 6 everything today 
Got home had 5 but charged for 6 (my bad) should of counted
2 of them burnt 
Buyer's Beware watch them
Not the best attitude"
__label__3	"OK, so I know it's a chain and I generally don't *do* chains, but since I was trying to compromise and had heard good things I agreed to try it.  I was happy to find out it was Bang Bang Wednesday (Bang Bang shrimp for $5) since everyone raved about the damn BB shrimp - personally thought they were OK, but not fantastic.  Probably just over-hyped.  But for $5 they were great.

I had the trout.  Trout = deeeelicious.  

I'll keep this place i"
__label__3	Went early on Saturday night. They were busy!! A lot of big parties. Service was a little slow but our waiter was accommodating. food was good (chicken parmigiana / Pappardelle Porcini), but not extraordinary. Desserts (tiramisu / chocolate mouse pie) were good. Apparently they have a prix fix menu on Weds in winter. I would give that a try, but would not go back for a date.
__label__3	Food was absolutely amazing, 5 stars to the kitchen staff! Front of house could use some work, my food came out before my beer, server would walk away before I could finish asking him for something. Everything just felt as if it was rushed and couldn't take time to provide full satisfaction.
__label__3	"I used to go here a lot with work people when I worked near by, but I was never really a fan. The place is usually pretty busy and the service is crap. There was one time where we sat there and waited and waited and waited and no server came near. 

We had just gotten off work and so we were understanding (we were all servers), but really it would be nice for someone to at least acknowledge us.

The drinks are overpriced and the service is mediocre. Now that I don't work near here, I won't come back."
__label__3	Sushi was okay! Not bad at all. I just come from the Bay Area in Cali and have had way fresher sushi than the stuff they serve here. They also didn't have a whole lot for their buffet options. Could add a few more things to that list.
__label__3	"Though a ""Chain"" facility, I found this to be an interesting place for food.
You pick out what you want cooked, squash it into a bowl and procede to the Mongolian Stir Fry station where it is cooked for you and then brought to your table by the wait staff. It is a crowded place, noisy, but can be lots of fun. The staff are upbeat, fast , pleasant and knowledgable about the various food items. It is worth a try and a chance to experiment with foods, flavors and tastes without having to cook yourself. Bar service is also available."
__label__3	Good service. Friendly faces but the food wasnt all that good. Cheap and quick. If that is what you want, then enjoy :)
__label__3	With a BOGO free, you have to take the sale. Came here late at around 10 and the place closes at 11. There was a line out the door. Total I waited 50 mins from standing in line to getting my ice cream. Compared to other places, this took a while to get. The flavors were good but by the end of the night, most toppings were out. Really wished they had a full stock. Inside was really hot and that made the ice cream difficult to freeze, which is also why the ice cream also melted super fast once I got it. I may go to another place.
__label__3	"Ed's is definitely the cheapest place in the University City area. My review is based on my experience with its catering. Cheap and accommodating. 

Food is what you'd expect for pizza and wings so I don't have a lot to say about the food. Expect to be full and feeling greasy after having Ed's wings or pizza. 

Staff is really nice in my experience at least over the phone."
__label__3	If you're craving good ol' po boys and fried side items this is a great place. Food was out fast for pick up(10 min early) when they told me 20 min. As you can see I was very excited to eat bc I took a bite before taking a pic! I scarfed it down, but soon my stomach started to hurt... lol.
__label__3	"O, Whole Paycheck (I mean Foods) Market... how I simultaneously love and yet loathe thee. I love thee for thy vast selection of high-quality foods and produce, yet I loathe thee for thy prices. What's a body to do? 

...Make more money, I guess, so we can continue to fork it over in the name of nutrition!"
__label__3	Super easy rental process. Everything is done electronically which is nice. Just make sure you take a photo of the gas gauge if you return after hours. This is the second time I got hit with a completely inaccurate filling fee. Also, my nonsmoking vehicle reeked of smoke.
__label__3	"I've been here a few times and it's always been good. They have good food and nice atmosphere.  Wings are my favorite here. I had The Seabass which was good not great but the cracked sea salt chunks on top were a turn off. I hated the sauce on the side. The short ribs were good too. My favorite winter drink to get is a hot apple pie martini. 

Service is average nothing special. Prices are fair."
__label__3	Well...I'm from Chicago so my expectations on a burger are pretty high. This burger was really bad (dry, no flavor and over cooked). Beer selection was pretty good and service was good. The sweet potato fries were excellent.
__label__3	Saw bush last night and was so disappointed I wanted to leave after the third song. The visuals were corny and the lighting was horrible I couldn't keep my eyes open. The strobe lights were blinding and it definitely didn't have a bush feel. The volume was so low you could have a normal conversation in the crowd. The lights made the band look like an Asian pop rock band. The venue itself is very nice , drinks were reasonably priced, security did their job.
__label__3	"Alexis was great taking our order
With a cheerful smile and recommended the souvenir glass to take home - thanks I love cup collections and the food was good."
__label__3	The sushi tasted fine, but I assumed from the design of the place that this was more of a quick sushi take away type restaurant. I thought that meant lower prices and faster service. The prices are comparable to other sit down sushi places and our rolls kept falling apart. Service wasn't particularly quick, but they were making all food to order, so it didn't sway me. I would eat here again, but Sushi Joy is my staple.
__label__3	"Great place to go and have bread bowl and a drink, but make sure your ready to have everything on one check because they do not split checks which is a bummer but what can you do. 

Wisconsin cheddar is my GO TO it's super yummy and the PB&J are huge. Definitely get that half sandwich and bread bowl combo."
__label__3	This Nike Factory Store is located in the Limerick Outlets. I have only been in here once roughly 4 years ago with my parents because my Mom was looking for some new sneakers because the shoes she was wearing wee bugging her. She found a good pair of sneakers and was happy with them so overall it was a good experience.
__label__3	I love this place for random seasonal decorations and crafts. Today I was looking for Christmas stickers & confetti for my Christmas cards. I tried to find them myself but couldn't so I asked a sales associate where they were. She said the Christmas stuff was all over the store and I would just have to look. Not what I was expecting. I did find what I wanted on my own. Usually the workers there are super friendly and willing to help you find what you are looking for.
__label__3	"From our visit on 3/17/19, about 12:30 pm.
There wasn't a clean table on the restaurant!  They did start cleaning tables before we left.
We ordered  Asada fries and nachos.   I am not sure if it is the norm, but the cheese was simply unmelted shredded cheese over the top of both dishes.  There was quite a bit asada on both dishes, but it was terribly bland.   While I felt like the portions are a good value, I feel the lack of flavor takes away from that value..."
__label__3	"Good food and coffee, neat atmosphere-- really cute place nestled away in a quiet neighborhood. 

Main thing that this place is lacking is friendly service. Staff isn't in too much of a hurry to say ""Hi, may I help you?"" and pretty much don't seem to care whether they have customers or not. 

Like the place, but they could definitely use some improved customer service."
__label__3	Food was good, however with being allergic to avocados they seemed inconvenienced when I asked to leave it off. They still brought the guacamole to the table and I had to return it due to being allergic. So I would say the food gets a 3 but the service a 1.
__label__3	It's gone a bit downhill over the last year.  TV's don't work for sports and the sound system can't even broadcast the main games.  Staff however is still great.  Brendan's THE BEST!
__label__3	"Like so many places on Frenchman, this place offers a variety of musical stylings and crowds depending on the day of the week. Vaso may be repping a hip-hop sense of young-ish club goers or hosting a mellow mixed crowd for the weekly blues/soul performances or brimming with street brass and dancing. 

Best Memory -- Power outage on Frenchman effected this venue during a rainstorm, the brass band played on, the crowd thickened, the dancing escliated, and the drinks kept flowing."
__label__3	"A few disclaimers:
1. I am not a Philly native
2. I do not consider myself a pretzel connoisseur.

Center City pretzel company is great for cheap fresh pretzels. They have very odd hours which makes it difficult to stop by. We came by early on a Sunday morning. The pretzels were cheap, warm, and soft. However, I personally feel like PPF and Federal pretzel are better in taste. Hence the 3 stars for flavor."
__label__3	Awesome vegan options, really tasty burritos and desserts. Just wish they had more GF options then getting your burrito in a giant soup bowl (I got corn tortillas on the side when I asked). My partner and I loved our meal but unfortunately as soon as I got home my stomach felt upset by the food.
__label__3	I decided to try Machi since it was only a few blocks away from my apartment. I ordered their 3 roll special for $10.95. The sushi was sub-par but the serving size was a little smaller than I was expecting. I ordered the typical stuff (california, tuna and eel avocado roll) and it just didn't excite my pallet as compared to other sushi places around the area.
__label__3	"I bought a belt here.  They have stuff.  Its a department store.  

Woooooo!"
__label__3	"Good customer service, cute place. Their specials are usually unique and good. The food is just ""ok."""
__label__3	"The cupcakes are good, but they are expensive.  A dozen ""specialty"" cupcakes cost me about $40.  To me, that's just way too much for a cupcake, I don't care how good it is!"
__label__3	"We really enjoyed our brunch experience, but dinner was underwhelming. I got the lotus salad and unfortunately it was mostly iceberg lettuce covered in soy sauce for $13. My friend's pasta dish was great, however. It also rubbed me the wrong way that my husband had to pay $2 per drink for ice when ordering ""on the rocks."" What?! Servers were sweet and attentive. Decor is on point."
__label__3	We ordered Grubhub delivery from here today and I'm somewhat disappointed. I ordered 3 pulled pork sandwiches and 3 sides. I specifically asked for tangy BBQ Sauce and received NO sauce whatsoever. It's hard for me to eat BBQ with no sauce. ANY sauce would've been better than NONE! Thanks a lot Dickey's, I won't Be ordering from you, again! Overall, the pulled pork was ok, but the baked beans were nothing special.
__label__3	Point blank period this one amd only 2 others are way better than Lindenwold Animal Shelter. Which a nuke should be dropped on that shelter. This place also houses very aggressive dogs.. but atleast stuff and volunteers are walking around if you need something.. they need to disclose the history of the dogs with the interested current party. Ive only been interested in two dogs one I didnt know had a biting issue until I did a meet with her and the other which was a husky mix had to much enegry and never stayed focused...
__label__3	"Because of its location and vicinity to State Street, this hotel was very price, even for just one night. 

The beds are decently comfortable, considering the price we paid for one night (approximately $270), but they do offer a ton of pillows (at least 6-7).

I wish the prices weren't too high, otherwise, this place would have gotten higher ratings from me. 

My friend and I accessed the pool and it was pretty crowded.  The hotel does offer you pool towels though, so that was another plus.  They also offer free WiFi."
__label__3	"A small local spot to grab brunch and they were kid friendly.

We tried the pancakes which were fine but definitely no wow factor, these pancakes could have been made at home.  Served with Aunt Jemima syrup on the table.   

Omelette with spinach, mushrooms, and onions was fine, again could be made easily at home.   The home fries that came with the eggs could have been better.  

Service was friendly and quick."
__label__3	Great atmosphere.  Charming.  Mediocre food - at best. And it's hard to mess up breakfast.
__label__3	Food is good but it takes over 45 minutes to an hour for it to arrive.   Even if you order something simple as a pizza or a burger for the kids.  I would give it another chance since it was a long weekend and they were very busy.
__label__3	Went for take out.  I'm not exactly what was up but it was very quiet even though it was a Sunday evening.  The food was tasty: (very peppery raita), excellently done naan, rich makhani and kofta.  The staff was overly nice and the inside looked decent.  Will definitely go back but want to look into other Indian restaurants in the area...
__label__3	This was my first visit. I was surprised at the limited menu. It has the look of a somewhat nice restaurant but doesn't have any appetizers and minimal things on the menu besides pizza. The pizza was ok. Drinks are served in the bottle. The poor older woman at the table next to us had to as a gentleman at another table to open her drink for her. Manager seemed very nice, stopping by to ask if we needed anything. Unfortunately my kids and I like a place with more selection on the menu and will not be back.
__label__3	"We start with the fish Kali mirch, the chicken chili and the spicy kabob. All fresh and tasty.

The chicken vindaloo is ok but a little bland. The saag is ok but portion is small. In fact, their portions are small in general. Naan is not bad but not great.

All in all, a decent place with passable food. Servers are nice and attentive. Service is quick in my experience."
__label__3	"Surprisingly spacious. Friendly barista. I was impressed with their ""condiments"" bar - whole/skim/soy milk, half and half, honey, the usual array of sugar choices, and...agave nectar?! Wow."
__label__3	Food is great but it took 55 minutes before we received our order. On top of the wait, one order was incorrect and they double charged us on the bill for my sandwich. Nice ambiance, talented musician playing, but we won't ever return due to the lack of professionalism.
__label__3	The atmosphere  was warm and the host and waiting  staff were friendly. I went during restaurant  week but ordered off the regular  menu..shrimp and grits which was nothing spectacular and a crab dish appetizer which didn't leave me wanting more it tasted pedestrian. I liked the fact I could hear the jazz music without having to be seated directly  near the performance. I like to vibe of the restaurant  that's  about it.
__label__3	"I was a long-time client and only left when I moved to Chester County and generally needed a salon closer to me.  Monica was my stylist and Annette gave me manis and both did consistently great work.

Lisa, if you read this, I hope all is well and please tell Monica and Annette I said ""hi""!"
__label__3	"Great atmosphere.  Service was sufficient.  Food was good but nothing that really had that ""wow"" factor from an outsider like me.  Great peach cobbler - better than any I've ever had in Atlanta, the peach state!"
__label__3	It was my first time ordering from them and I would rate the place as aggressively mediocre. I didn't think it was bad. The dough was fairly rubbery in every context. (I ordered pizza, their garlic knots, and their cinnamon knots.) I ate everything but probably won't go back.
__label__3	Come here like every day. I often have to wait for a squat rack or bench press. There are plenty of tredmils though. No tvs in the weight area. Great cycling and yoga classes.  Pool and sauna are nice. Dad likes the basketball
__label__3	My first time here and it's a movie theatre. It was clean, I just wish theatre's would clean the floors of each theatre each night.
__label__3	A crowded and rather raucous place, but once seated the service was good and the food okay. The paella was rather dry and crusty. Recommend some of the tapas instead.
__label__3	Very busy and small diner but the food was well prepared and delicious. I had the cheese steak and was very enjoyable. I will revisit them again.
__label__3	Nice happy hour specials the setup in the place is cool and looks as though patio area would be nice in warmer months. The food was ok nothing that wowed us but nothing that was bad either. Flat breads were good and boneless wings were the best thing I had. The service was great
__label__3	I was really, really excited to make it here. I had read good things, and heard similar comments from friends.  I really just thought it was... OK.  The guacamole was the high point, really great. We tried the queso with the chips but it was bland and after it cooled it didn't taste that good.  The tacos were good, but not $4 good.  Bummer. I really wanted to like this place, but I don't think I'll be back.
__label__3	"Mixed reviews on food.  A few people ordered seafood that included crab legs but they did not have utensils for everyone  to crack the crab....we were told to share what they had. 

Our order got lost...so we had to wait quite awhile for the food and were no comped anything for the inconvenience. The waitress was very nice but I think inexperienced. 

But the dish that several others had was very good and the contemporary industrial setting nicely done....thought could use a few more pops of color."
__label__3	Pretty crappy service...slow.... Reuban's came out wrong sent both back... No meat on the Reuban.. good taste but no substance..
__label__3	"They get 3  for great food but terrible service.  Their potato salad is really good and their Gyro was huge.  

If you order the Greek salad you better be hungry because it's huge too!  

There was only 1 table when I went there, it took me 20 minutes to get my food.  When my friend arrived it took him awhile to order and a long time for his Salad.  ( about 15 min). 

I'll go back because the food was great and I hope the service is better so I can give them 4 stars."
__label__3	Great ambiance ....but their buy one take one home pasta deal is crap if you're from out of town without a fridge.  Either charge half or allow to swap out for a dessert upon verification of a drivers license.
__label__3	It's a nice experience, but my gripe is that most of the windows are not clean.  Observation decks costing $19 admission should have clean windows.  If the windows had been clearer, I would have given a 4 or 5 star rating.  The view from the 65th floor is great, the exhibits, maps and information are excellent, especially the interactive maps that zoom in and out .... and I liked seeing the inside of the top of this skyscraper with its steel frames and angular design.
__label__3	Starbucks is always good. I love the oatmeal and passion tango ice tea. My boyfriend had a coffee frap he liked very much!  The only reason I'm giving 3 stars to this Starbucks is because I looked all over for a recycling bin to recycle my cups etc and it was no where to be found. There was a whole story on the wall about how Starbucks is trying to be green etc. but there was no recycling bin?!  They definitely need a recycling bin and a compost bin!  Then they will get five stars!!
__label__3	"Great food and service!
Shrimp and Chicken fried rice were equally awesome. Shogun roll was really good, also had shrimp and asparagus roll (first time ever having that combo) and it was delicious. Spicy tuna and shrimp tempura were very good as well. 
Overall, great food, presentation, atmosphere and service. My new go-to sushi restaurant in the northeast."
__label__3	I have been back a few times. Love the 3 colored enchiladas but decided to try something different. Had the poor mans steak. Was way too pricey for a cheap no flavor steak that I ordered med rare but it's so think that's impossible. Plantain was best part. Do not go here without a coupon. Still feel the prices are too high that's why the place is half empty.
__label__3	I tried their beignets, and honestly am not that impressed. I've had tastier ones in DMV area. Person was right about the pound of crushed sugar that comes with your order. It's alright, certainly not the best.
__label__3	Tried this restaurant for the first, because i had read that they will use gluten free bread with sandwiches and they did! I had a turkey sandwich with lettuce, tomato & cheese on gluten free bread and it was excellent. Everything tasted fresh. My only concern was the length of time it took for our meal to be served. The restaurant was busy, but it appears the kitchen couldn't handle a full house. I'm willing to give the place another try, hoping this was not the norm.
__label__3	Nice family run market/restaurant. They have fresh meat and Mexican product such as tortillas, chips, spices, sodas, etc. I ordered 2 carne asada burros and nachos. The burros were good but the nacho chips were hard, they tasted old. The salsa bar was ok, but  the to go cup containers were so small it wouldn't hold a ladle full of sauce. Service was good. During lunchtime they are busy since they are close to DMAFB.
__label__3	Came for trivia with friends and ordered a few things while we played. The service was really slow but everything we ordered was okay, nothing extraordinary.
__label__3	Their three-cheese pizza is delicious.  (Really, everything I've had here is great.)  Just wish they had delivery!
__label__3	I went to see if Turkish food was the best in the world.  Turns out it's not.  It's just OK.  Overall not a bad experience.  Attentive service and decent food.  I was just expecting more.
__label__3	Decent chain, great atmosphere.  Their Mediterranean menu does not have a lot of choices for vegetarians, so I went with the pasta and they have an above average Pomodoro sauce that impressed me.  The dinner atmosphere was excellent and the service was good, we were seated promptly even though they were crowded, and our server was attentive and helpful.  Kind of hard to tell this is a chain, it does not feel like one.
__label__3	"Crush cakes has great cupcakes!  I think they are absolutely delicious!

That being said, I finally tried the much hyped up red velvet pancakes.  They were horrible.  The only reason they taste good is you have the option to slather then in either syrup or frosting.  I wanted to send them back, but my husband ate them (he hates sending stuff back).  DO NOT waste your money on them!"
__label__3	This place is a really great location for my work commute and I look to make appointments in this area. It is right off highway 69. It is a bit out of the way to get to the location, but not bad. Wifi is reliable. There was no line to order and my drink was made quick. One con that I think is directly tied to the location is that it was packed. Had to wait for a spot to sit and I was asked about my table when I was going to use restroom and again as I was leaving.
__label__3	Service was very good but food's nothing out of the ordinary. They're practicing social distancing very well so that's a plus!
__label__3	"I've been to Billy's several times, only had terrible service once....avoid eating there from Feb to after Easter, it is just too crowded with tourists.  

The house salad is one of the stand out items, so is the fresh baked bread.  Kind of expensive, so definitely not a place to go weekly.

Ask for Melissa or Matt, they are two of the best servers."
__label__3	Came here for my Dads birthday hoping to have an awesome dinner with the family. Was somewhat disappointed in our food and service. The server was nice and all but she did not take care of us that well. She said she was going to bring a little cake for my dad but did not at the end (we were her only table). Overall did not have a pleasant visit.
__label__3	I have purchased several heaters air conditioners and water heaters from Davis Modern H and AC,  had ongoing maintenance contracts and had been very pleased with their service, however I purchased a new air conditioner a few weeks ago and it takes 2 hours to cool down each degree.  I was told it was because it was 95+ degrees outside but same is happening now that it is 81 degrees outside.  My last one cooled much faster even just before it died.  Although I am told it had the same capacity as my old one it is very disappointing.
__label__3	"The quickest of locksmiths! Priciest too though. If in a rush use you should use them, but if not in a rush you should wait for someone who will be half the price.

Perhaps not related but worth noting: The credit card I used with them (on a square chip reader) had fraudulent charges attempted for days later. First a couple $1 charges on square chip reader then attempts at $150 & $200 wire transfers."
__label__3	"Last week they were amazing. This week they're already becoming ""Bourbon"". Last week when I ordered a slice (and I did so a few times as it's new and I work down here) they would warm it up for a minute before they gave it out. Now it seems they don't care if they serve cold pizza. Just throw the food out to the drunks as fast as they can. Vieux Carre is back to being the only option for me. Unfortunate, as their styles are completely different. They could have existed side by side comfortably."
__label__3	I am really surprised some people say the coffee was good. It was awful and extremely weak. However the Brussel sprout salad was amazing. Just need some better coffee - my guess is someone didn't leave the right instructions for the staff due to the French Press. We complained and got new coffee made - a little better but not much. Brussel Sprout salad worth the trip.
__label__3	"Came here for brunch this past weekend had the following:
Coffee-good!
Passion Mimosa-Passion Fruit Juice+Champagne=one happy girl!

Brioche French Toast: Delicious
Coconut Shrimp-Superb (although they need to find a different dipping sauce recipe)
Turkey and Brie on Multigrain Croissant: MEH. There was a funny taste to the meat, and I didn't finish my sandwich (and I ALWAYS finish sandiwches).

I would return, but next time I will try something else."
__label__3	10.00 burrito for beans rice and meat, 1.50 extra for cheese... meat not trimmed for fat so you get big chunks of that. Not horrible but better choices for a 11-12 dollar burrito there's better ones out there in town.
__label__3	"Way overpriced. For something I know I could get for half the price at other places, my conscience just does not allow me to come here. They have a monopoly in the area and there will be lots of college students who come here. All they need is one fro yo shop to come in and get some competition in the area. But hey, good for them in still being able to get business while charging too high prices on kids craving fro yo. 
For comparison, I can get cheaper stuff and more quantity in the Upper East Side in Manhattan! That should never happen."
__label__3	Great food. The Tucson sandwich sauce was not for me. The smashed hash was divine and the seasons wasn't to bad.
__label__3	"So - Bocco is no long on our rotation -

Food is till good  - I guess, but I cannot patronize an establishment with rude servers (managers). 

It's been 8 weeks since my wife or I have been in Bocco.   Amir - maybe one of the more rude individuals I have encountered in some time drove us away.

Sorry Bocco - you can find us at Giovanni's."
__label__3	hello everyone, mitra da dhaba is located on interstate 465 exit-4 where you see on the left it pilot gas station and on the right is flying j. It is a best place you can get on the go descent portion of good Indian food. mitra da dhaba is a mix style restaurant where they also serve american breakfast whole day.
__label__3	A nice, clean healthfood store. I used to be able to buy the best organic cat nip here, but unfortunately they don't carry it any more.  They do, however, carry Aura Cacia oils, and that's a good thing.
__label__3	A lot of bad reviews, but I didn't find it bad at all. Pretty normal average place nothing fancy it's just a place to spend the night. The room was clean and comfortable bed with tv and great wifi. They also have complimentary breakfast from 6-9 and they have a lot of stuff. Nice pool as well.
__label__3	My first night in florida and my hubbie wanted to come here.  I had the dozen oysters to start--decent.   They were fresh and it soothed my seafood craving.  But my meal wasn't that great.  I had the mahi mahi tacos and it tasted odd.  My hubbie had the lobster and it was good.  My kids had the pizza and popcorn shrimp and they enjoyed them.  I suppose I was looking for some incredible seafood meals here but it was more like a diner.  It was super kid friendly and had a fun atmosphere.  But tonight we will find something a bit different.
__label__3	The place has a really cool vibe, and I enjoy the drinks. I have been here several times and every time the service has been bad. I am not sure if it is because they are too short staffed, but the wait staff always seems to be missing or overwhelmed. The food is good, but IMO not worth the price. Some of the entrees are ~$30 and definitely overpriced for what you get and the setting you are eating it in.
__label__3	The staff and crunchy cheese fries saved this review -- the rubbery cheesesteak is very weak, not a top 5 place to go to. I would not recommend it.
__label__3	It was ok. Not the best Mexican restaurant but not the worst either. Enchilada Rojas tastes awful. The flavor doesn't really come together. Too much going on, there's prickly flavor and sweet then spicy and gross it's all over the place. One bite you like it, the next bite you don't and the next you kinda wanna throw up.
__label__3	"I had the slammin salmon for my first and last visit to hai street.  It is an average size sushi roll, re-named a ""sushirrito"". It is actually less filling than an average california roll because it is ~75% filler cabbage stuff, 15% salmon, 10% rice and seaweed. After I saw how small it actually is, I knew I would need a side so I ordered the chips and wasabi guac. What a horrible idea, it was hardly edible.  I can see why the place was so empty. Won't be returning again."
__label__3	Nope. I just don't get it. Maybe I'm spoiled as an LA based vegan (Crossroads Kitchen, Little Pine, Gracias Madre, V Station....all true five star vegan restaurants) but this was a giant over-salted yawn of a meal. Just an over-hyped nope of a menu  and meal.
__label__3	I don't know what everybody's beef is about the wait time.  I cruised through the drive-through in no time.  The staff was very friendly.  As for the food?  Hey, they're sliders; what do you expect?  They taste yummy going down and you'll of course regret them later.  That's the deal.
__label__3	Best fish spread ever; great service. My only complaint is we went to the smoked fish shack with the intention of taking some home, however the person working in there needs a course in civility. We left without buying anything from him.
__label__3	Luke's Lobster is a great spot if you're craving a lobster roll this summer. I've been a fan since they opened their Rittenhouse location, and was excited to find their new location near my office off Market Street. Their rolls are delish and the service is superb. The only issue is the price for what you pay. The rolls have shrinky dinked in size! For $21 the trio includes 3 different rolls that should be free samples at Costco. The rolls are teeny tiny. They leave you hungry for more food. The individual roll size is not much bigger!
__label__3	I really liked their flavor options. Hello Huckleberry! That is such a hard flavor to find so it was great to see if offered. Luckily I put two and two together and noticed that you really should choose something with more fat, and less water base. As things like almond milk and low fat milk are gonna melt a lot fast. Not to mention they froze a bit more ice chunky than my cream based one. I would go here again because the flavors are awesome, but get a small, cause it will melt fast!
__label__3	"Sullivan's used to be a great Thursday happy hour spot - great crowd, good food, good drinks, and good prices ($5 bar menu and martinis).  Things have changed a bit, the crowd has thinned out and gotten noticeably more mature, the bar menu for food has changed (bleu cheese chips and the burger remain, but no more steak), and prices have gone up ($7 bar menu and martinis).

Sullivan's needs to step up their game - not their prices - to compete with the great downtown happy hour scene."
__label__3	Another hidden sushi place, this one tucked away in Arnold. A small dining room, a bar and a hibachi room complete this little place. Super clean and great service!
__label__3	"Met up with some friends here for breakfast after I ate mine elsewhere. Ate the Shrimp & Grits with a Mimosa since it looked good on the table of someone else. It wasn't too bad but it wasn't something I could come back for.

The place gets busy and the staff is nice, but nothing that really puts it over 3 Stars for me. I felt like this was a local ""tourist"" stop since it is convenient for most foot traffic."
__label__3	Please don't shoot me, Tin Comet fans. Unfortunately, Tin Comet Coffee is not my vibe. The grunge feel and locals who appear to hang out for hours on end shooting the shit were somewhat distracting. Good news is, they have a decent tea selection and I hear the coffee drinks are tasty (they feature local beans like Tinker Coffee Co).  The space is filled with books you can read while drinking, a piano, a counter and handful of tables. Cozy. I'll give it a third visit but I'm more likely to frequent the light and airy coffee shops.
__label__3	We have ate at many P.F. Chang restaurants across the county.  Usually the food is very consistent and good.  Last night the Mongolian Beef was over cooked and lacked that sweet finish that all the other locations have had. Further, the sauce for the honey chicken was off and tasted like vinegar.  Waiter was very nice and the location is very clean etc.  After reading some reviews post visit there is definitely something going on with this kitchen.  They are not putting out a quality product.
__label__3	I'll reserve my decision on the present day Urban Cantina until the renovations are done. In the past the food was great, and the service was very pleasant. I look forward to giving UC another chance.
__label__3	Chilling with some friends. Comfy atmosphere to hang out for a catch up. Service was great, friendly and very speedy. Hit the happy hour was a great way to try it out. Glad I did it that way.
__label__3	Good but overrated in my opinion. The bonuts and B-roll are very good but everything was good but not great. I'd prefer other breakfast places to here considering the wait at times and prices
__label__3	To cool for me, after having my wife hit on and the staff giving my order to their bf. Tupac and the stupid disco ball was the last thing I needed. Will stick to KFC for chicken from now on, very unprofessional business.
__label__3	Nice atmosphere when you sit outside and staff is friendly. Food is mediocre. We had the cheesesteak egg rolls and they were doughy. In short they should have fried them longer.
__label__3	Service is pretty good - bartenders can get preoccupied. Food is pretty good (pub grub - nothing fancy...I went with beer cheese fries). Beer prices are pretty good. Some of the staff are cute. One of the bartenders was gorgeous. The other bartender (also cute) looked like she was high.
__label__3	Great hotel, always love the Hyatt. Only mark down is due to the fact they aren't aware their business in Google Maps is placed clear next to the Airport. If you're running a major business you need to make sure the big players like Yelp, Google Maps, etc, have the correct information and location of your business.
__label__3	This is a neighbourhood bar for the locals.  They have drink specials.  There is a large tv for sports.  They have poker machines.  There is a pool table.  They have karaoke on the weekends.  Clubhouse sandwich and bacon and eggs were good.  Unfortunately the host karaoke lady was rude and abrupt and somewhat of a put off.
__label__3	"Your typical average Mexican restaurant - not great, but not bad.  

Service was very friendly.  

Now the salad bar... mmm can't say I'm a fan of carrots turning white.  So just pass on that and you will enjoy."
__label__3	"Came here because the wait and Oxford Exchange was too long. From the start, it was a little stinky and dirty inside. The service was good. Food was okay, just a little plain and unimpressive. We tried some of their in-house baked pastries, which tasted great. 
Overall, I would come back for the pastry, not necessarily the food."
__label__3	I love the drive thru for breakfast burritos and coffee. This would be my favorite place by far if it wasn't for their over complicated and petty punch card. You have to have a specific card for espresso and non espresso and size of drink. It's confusing and makes what should be a fun experience rigid. So unfortunately if I just want a coffee drink I'll go to Dutch Brothers where their punch card is simple and easier to earn a free coffee. But I will always be back for the breakfast burritos.
__label__3	"The ordering system is really cool. It's basically an iPad mounted on a wall that you can place your own order on. Once I figured that out, it was pretty cool.

I only got a bubble tea, which wasn't mind blowing. I have heard good things about the sushi, though, and the proximity to Vanderbilt's campus is a big plus."
__label__3	Short staffed. Long waits! This is the only dispensary that takes forever to get supplies from. They aren't flexible with their delivery system. You have Wednesday and Friday that they deliver and you have to place it days in advance to guarantee to be on route.
__label__3	Went here for Valentine's Day. The service was fine but the servers seemed like they had to much to say for their specials that they were running out of breath. We started with the spinach soufflé and it tasted just like egg so it was definitely not for me, but maybe if you really like soufflé you will like it. The seafood soup was good. Didn't try the desert.
__label__3	Had to get a new tire for the husbands car. They were fair in their pricing and professional. We had to have the car towed in and they got it in right away. They were professional on the phone as well as in store. We do not live close but had the flat near this location and recommend it to anyone that is in the area, beats going to the dealer that would have price gouged us.
__label__3	Not the best place for a burger lover if beef is what your looking for search elsewhere, outbacks very limited burger selection features 3 burgers. Despite my complaint about the range of burgers the loaded blooming onion was okay not hot the first time and not cheesy enough the second time, very well seasoned.
__label__3	Used to come here quite a bit for their ribs special. Decent overall
__label__3	"Hot chicken is amazing but I'd rather let an adult elephant step on my foot before standing in line there again.

Hot chicken sandwich is my favorite.  Honey mustard on the French cries, come on wit it.  

The size of this place is smaller than a Juarez crack shack though."
__label__3	The Bodega is a nice spot. I wouldn't call it the most authentic cuban spot, if you want that head over to tampa -- its more of a hipster take on cuban cuisine. I really love the cuban sandwich and the Lechon.  If I was giving a review for just the sandwiches it would be an instant 5! The service isn't always the friendliest and the sides leave something to be desired; the beans are definitely fresh though, they just lack seasoning. Also, I recommend that you call ahead, the wait can be insane during lunch time.
__label__3	I always try the marinara sauce when I try an Italian restaurant for the first time because if a marinara sauce is great on its own, then anything added can only be better.  I tried Ralph's once and was not impressed.  This is not to say the food isn't good, just not good enough for me to return.
__label__3	Bartender gave us a friendly greeting.  The server didn't seem to want to be there or earn her tip.  Food was good as always.  Servers need to be friendly even if they aren't living the life of their dreams...
__label__3	OK breakfast/brunch but pricey and not that good. My favorite thing was probably the oysters benedict. The oysters were cooked perfectly. The banana forester was too sweet for my taste and the french toast wasn't fluffy and wasn't anything special.
__label__3	Food was pretty good! Husband didn't like his steak quesadillas because they were chalked full of tomatoes and peppers with the steak. It's not your normal quesadilla. However, I had a grilled chicken chimichanga with rice and beans and was pretty satisfied! It was smothered with queso so you can't beat that. Plenty of things on the menu to try though. We will be back.
__label__3	Typical fast food chicken.... good spicy tenders and red beans & rice, but the service and crazy line set-up was less than ideal.
__label__3	"Stopped in because my wife's feet hurt. Had a couple of ""solid"" margaritas. The bartender (Donna?) was super personable with the folks at the bar, carrying on multiple conversations. We sat at one of the tables and watched the people stroll by on a Friday night. Older crowd, quiet bar."
__label__3	"It's a so so store. Good enough but not good enough if you know what I mean. They have some decent selections one certain items but they don't try and break the mold, so to speak, in 'new and improved.' 

Staff have always been friendly. The store has always been clean. We go to this location on occasion since ALDI is a little further away."
__label__3	Great place to eat. Love the spicy options, but a little too greasy at times. Other than that, delicious!
__label__3	Pretty nice!  Not too busy on a weeknight. The beer was cold, staff was pleasant and we enjoyed ourselves....though we usually do! Nice and clean. I appreciate a clean business!
__label__3	"Food was delicious...got the kimchi rice ball side and pork belly buns. 

Cocktails were nothing to write home about.

The clientele were your typical hipster mishmash...I retreated to a booth to observe the ridiculousness unfold.

I did visit on a holiday weekend so I hope the vibe would be better on a regular night. But after one cocktail I had to get out.

There is a nice patio were smoking is allowed."
__label__3	Authentic Mexican food. Came here for lunch and the food came SO fast! The waiter we had was super friendly too. The lunch menu had a lot of combos and options and reasonably priced. The food wasn't anything crazy special, but decent for the price.
__label__3	"I made an executive decision yesterday while driving around with my mom to eat at Brio for lunch. It was the first visit for both of us, and unfortunately, we both ended up throwing out our leftovers.

She chose the Mezza Chicken Under the Brick, which she deemed ""just alright.""

I picked the Campanelle Carbonara, which sounded different, but was overloaded with the taste of Alfredo sauce. I was hoping it would have more of a bacon-y vibe.

Brio is a decent place to stop in the Promenade, but there are definitely way better options in the area."
__label__3	It's Starbucks, and I'm not a hater.  But this place was understaffed and kind of dirty.
__label__3	My friend and myself were visiting Philly and decided to walk in here. It was actually kind of dead, we ordered a shot of green tea and 2 Radler's each. I was surprised it was brought in a beer mug, lets just say it took us awhile to finish our Radler's. Overall I had a pretty good expierence there.
__label__3	Good burgers and fries but why so expensive? 3 burgers with bacon, 2 orders of fries and 1 hot dog and 2 iced teas was $50.... fifty dollars! I get the grass fed beef is more but how is this a sustainable business model? Maybe in New Hope this works but prices like that are not practical almost anywhere else.
__label__3	"I feel really conflicted about this. The happy hour food is amazing, probably some of the best HH grub in the city. Get the brussel sprouts, chicken or pork buns, edamame dumplings, and the pork banh mi (best value). 


But the drink specials are not great and the service is abysmal. All they need is more generous draft list offerings and better HH cocktails and most importantly more than one bartender!"
__label__3	This Starbucks is in a hopping spot right in the middle of the Philadelphia Premium outlets.  So be prepared to wait in line for a while. They do a pretty good job of keeping things moving but it is crowded.  They do have some outside seating which is nice. All in all its your average Starbucks.
__label__3	I've heard so much hype about this place but honestly, I was not impressed. In my opinion, the prices were too expensive for the quality and taste of the food. I realize you're also paying for the atmosphere but it was so noisy at 2:00 in the afternoon that we had to yell to hear each other. $14 for soup, $16 for a cosmopolitan that was lacking in flavor and alcohol, plus $15 for a cake that was nothing impressive all amounted to a $50 lunch!!
__label__3	Stick with the coffee. The pour over is nice but the chai tea latte is basically warm milk.
__label__3	I have wondering around broad ripple one afternoon after getting my haircut and saw this place. Star number is they only serve craft beer! Star number 2 they selective is phenomenal! Star three the vegan bowl ( I'm not vegan) has got to be he best vegan/ vegetarian dish I think i have ever tried. The appetizers weren't so good and I really would waste my time on ordering them again. Huge place, friendly service, and was seated immediately.
__label__3	This is your standard Shop Rite.  It usually has everything we need.  They have great sales and I never have to park too far away from the entrance.  The cashiers are extremely friendly and the deli staff is surprisingly nice.
__label__3	l Steak 'n Shake food reasonable pretty cheap, quick service, food has improved, kid likes the garlic burger
__label__3	Good lunch option. Not worth driving way across town for.  Decent Italian food, good portions.  Not outstanding, but given the lack of great Italian food in the Tampa Bay area, this place is ok.
__label__3	Holy snikies, this place is really really expensive! Looks like they have a lot of healthy offerings but still, this takes gauging to a whole new level! 7.00 for almond milk?
__label__3	Huge portions and good flavor. It is more American style. I wasn't a huge fan of the sweet and sour chicken but the sesame chicken was great. The food comes quickly and the servers are nice.
__label__3	The food was great. BUT...our delivery took FOREEEEEEEEVER, because they brought half of the wrong order!!!! By the time we finally got the other half, the people that had ordered that food were too tired to keep waiting, so they went to sleep. It was a bummer!
__label__3	Food was fabulous!  I had the Reuben sandwich and was blown away by the pastrami.  My sister had the Chelsea burger.  She said it was like a steak with onions.   They definitely push you to drink, which I know it's a tavern, but wasn't really appreciated.  The service....eh.  But to be fair, it seemed like the management should have had more people working the shift.  We were from out of town and this place is clearly a favorite with the locals.
__label__3	Got a mani /pedi here today. It was just fine, not rave worthy nor negative so here you go. Just fine!
__label__3	"They brew their own beer on site which is cool. Enjoyed a handmade veggie burger. It was huge and dry but nice to have that option in a super meat heavy town. Had the ""hoppy"" fire chief red ale. Wasn't hoppy but was easy to drink. Overall, their weren't any problems, it is just a very generic place."
__label__3	I have never been to a JJ before, so looking at it from a fresh perspective I can say that I don't really feel a need to go back.  I do appreciate that they have an 8-inch sandwich as opposed to the 6/12 thing at Subway and the tuna salad was a-ok, nothing mind blowing. Maybe Brock Lesnar can make another funny ad or something causing me to go back here.
__label__3	Good, fresh food. It does take a long time for food to be served after ordering. Average 40-50 minutes in my experience.
__label__3	Not bad. You can't mess cheese pizza up too much. Beats overpriced restaurants on state street. Overpriced salad bar. Cheap pitchers of beer.
__label__3	"This place will def set you back a pretty penny but is worth every cent!

They have beers from all over the world, 350+

I paid $20 or a six pack but it's my first time visiting Philly and seeing a place like this so it was well worth it! Gotta love variety! It's def quality over quantity at this place"
__label__3	"The good things are that the breads are wonderful, the service is great and the place at Xmas is very pretty. I also think the cost for what you get is verygood.
The menu could use a little updating and a couple of the dish's were a little off.
The salads were good, but the short ribs were not so great. The chicken dish was ok, and they do have some great looking desserts.
Huge free parking lot, and at this time of the year a nice place to have dinner or at least stop in at the bar and have a drink and enjoy the decorations."
__label__3	We ordered chicken pakora, samosa chaat, malai kofta. Food was okay. Ambience was okay but customer service was excellent. The gentleman there took good care of us. He took the order back as we were not satisfied by the dish. May go back again.
__label__3	Great cupcakes, but service is lacking :/. How can you work at a cupcakery and not be so excited?!?  A little more service training would make it great.
__label__3	Decent place to grab a beer. Friendly setting and good prices. Just watch the steep stairs on your way out.
__label__3	This place was good and smelly! I know they are smoking meat and all, but you know what, I don't like it when I leave a restaurant and stink like I'm the one who has been working in the kitchen all night. The food was all good, but nothing was great and that with the smell of it all, yeah, I'm all set on this one.
__label__3	This location is definitely not the ideal Steak and Shake, but they're not terrible, either. With nearly the entire menu at $4, you definitely get what you pay for. The bathrooms are gross, the servers are something really awkward, sometimes their cash register goes down, but their food has reliably been the same price and taste for nearly a decade, which I admire.
__label__3	"Service was just chaos. Waiting 15 minutes so far for a gyro and 
Souvlaki. Our waitress was fantastic. Kitchen is clean. The two Owners seem to be causing more confusion. They need to just have higher a hostess. That will solve a lot of the issues."
__label__3	"Popped in for a Sunday brunch. I ordered the salmon benedict and coffee. 

The coffee is self serve which wouldn't be a problem, but it's a small restaurant and it's tight getting through some spaces when it's full of people.

The salmon benedict was tasty, but I found the house made English muffin hard to cut. It was really dense and not toasted. The egg, salmon and hollandaise sauce were on point though."
__label__3	I will be honest, everybody seems to love spicy hot chicken except me. I tried Hattie B's version of not spicy chicken but could not stand it. Not that it was spicy that I couldn't handle it but something with the flavoring of it was very offsetting. I can only speak for me so don't let me stop you from trying.
__label__3	"Much to do about not much....
The food was a solid 3 stars the service 3 stars
The location 3 stars, so what is the big deal here?
Oprah? Obama? This place could be great if they took Italy and its food seriously."
__label__3	"I got the pulled pork with Mac and cheese. The Mac and cheese was creamy. The pork was good and you get a good size portion. I wasn't too impressed with the whole meal, I think it's a northern thing that we always put A sauce on pulled pork and in the south they don't?  

I also got the peanut butter pie and it was more of a pudding pie, wasn't the best I've had but still good."
__label__3	Priced very reasonably. My lemon tart was very yummy. Definitely wished I tried the croissants, since my friend was raving about it for approximately 3 blocks after we left. The cafe au lait was nothing special. Atmosphere was a bit eclectic for my taste but nonetheless comfortable for light conversations or studying. The location is tucked away in the quieter section of the French Quarters so it might just be a bit of a hassle to get to for a tourist. Also the bakery closes mid-afternoon for some reason and doesn't open on Tuesdays.
__label__3	I wasn't a fan of this bar. It's a hit or mess as far as customers go. Some nights busy and others there is no one. I have heard the bartenders Are nice.
__label__3	I liked the intimacy, cleanliness, and simplicity.  Good quality food and preparation, but the portion of the sides was fairly small.   I was charged $5 more than my meal listed on the menu.  They gave me coffee I didn't order, but I thought maybe it came standard with the meal.  The bill was not itemized, so I couldn't see what the extra amount was for.  Anyhow, I felt somewhat schemed when the check arrived.  I don't know if I'd go back again or not.
__label__3	"Seats are good maybe b+
Foods bad, just like all movie places so middle of the road c. 
Staff is good b+."
__label__3	The decor both indoors and outside is super nice, and def very picturesque. Went here for brunch, nothing out of the ordinary, would not go back.
__label__3	High quality ingredients but I literally have never bought a sub with less meat. I've had their tomato pie as well which was great. Split it down the middle and they get 3 stars.
__label__3	The take out portion was smaller than the eat-in and that is disappointing. I went once to have dinner in and the forgot one of the dishes, that my friend had to take out (at least she took a bug portion cause they didn't know it was for take away!)
__label__3	"Was good. The girls taking my order had sort of little attitudes. I told them I had never been but they didn't have that ""southern hospitality"" or charm I expected. Had a little hair on my plate but they gave me a new order. Do t rennet the name of the guy but he was nice and was very apologetic. Will go back and try other items. Hopefully I can then give it 5 stars."
__label__3	"Service is horrible. I bought $100 of Padrons and a Chimay. The service person never asked me whether I needed another beer or if I needed my ashtray cleaned. All ashtrays are grossly disgusting. No service whatsoever, and the place is so busy you can't even fit at the bar. The cigar prices are great- but the atmosphere is so busy you can't even hear yourself from the people that are there. 

*update
Was contacted by management about my experience to hear about my experience and what they could do to make it right. I appreciate them reaching out."
__label__3	Food was decent. However there was no 'kids' menu, and the server told us we had gotten week old bread.
__label__3	"POKE IN SB???? NO WAY

I was so excited to come here after I found out it was opening! Unfortunately the first time, my friends and I were cut off in line since the opening was so huge. I eventually got to try it though!

Honestly, compared to the places back in the Bay Area, this place is mediocre. The interior is very nice and the staff is super friendly. The portion size is not too big. The fish quality can be better. However, when you're craving poke in SB, what can you do right?"
__label__3	Food  was excellent!  Service was average at best. Male server had an arrogance / snooty attitude toward us. Drink service slow and inconsistent. Will give it another try based on quality of food. They seem to have a couple of kinks in the hose they have to work out. Mainly people related.
__label__3	"Ok people.  This place is a DINER, not a linen table cloth restaurant.  We've come from the Bay Area twice a year to Joes for four years now.  All the times we've been to Joes the service is good.  Food dependable and the burgers very tasty.  Downside on the breakfast is the home fries.  Too much garlic.  
If you want fancy smancy food GO someplace else.  If you want some above average diner food, Joes is the place!!!"
__label__3	Loved the bowl overall, but they forgot to add the avocado and I was already home when I realized.
__label__3	"I hate writing a bias review, but I feel compelled. Call me spoiled, I'm used to Indianapolis where everything is smoke-free, but the smoke in this place is absolutely smothering. If someone in the establishment is smoking a cigar, forget about even trying for air.

I want to like this establishment, and I realize there is a ""non-smoking section"" (which you have to walk through the smog to get to) but I've just got too many non-smoking options to be excited about this place."
__label__3	Good cheese steak. Small and too much wiz, but enjoyable none the less. Parking is better here than by Geno's and Pat's, but if you're on the south side, I'd take either of those spots ahead of TL's.
__label__3	This was our first stop on our recent visit.  The line looked daunting but moved pretty quickly.  The hard part was finding a place to sit, which we were able to do eventually.  It was all tourists.  The server/bus person we encountered told us something curtly about where to sit but we weren't able to understand.  Anyway, our food came pretty promptly.  I enjoyed my fried catfish po boy.  The hot sauce on the table really added something.  My husband however did not care for the famous ferdi.  I tried it and it was sort of just an average meat-meat sandwich.
__label__3	"What happened to the size of the bagels?  Check out the new econo-sized bagel on my blog

They are still tasty though...  

Great place for a bagel.  Lunch offerings are marginal."
__label__3	Steak was salty, expected better quality. Service was wonderful, atmosphere was great. Food wasn't the best,  we've had better at Longhorn.
__label__3	I've always ordered my banh mi thit nguoi from Cafe Cuong. They always come out with toasty baguettes with the right amount of lunch meat, pate and butter every single time. I always ask for the pickled vegetables and fresh vegetables to be separate since I usually order about 10 sandwiches to bring back to Jersey. My go to banh mi in Philadelphia is definitely Cafe Cuong.
__label__3	Barbuzzo was a good meal, but compared to other places I've been in SF or NYC, I thought this mid-level restaurant didn't offer a very good value and everything was overly salty and fatty. Even the dishes that tasted great seemed like they were cheating with all the fat and salt they used. I don't think great food needs to rely on salt--if the flavors are right, then that will shine through.
__label__3	Went here for happy hour.  The menu has a descent selection ranging from $1.95 to $4.95.  There is however a drink minimum which I think is odd to have.  The food tasted fine but nothing outstanding.  The service was fast and friendly.  The place was not crowded when we were there, making it good for having conversations and relaxing after a day of work.
__label__3	Boyfriend loves this place but I wasn't thrilled. I would rather go somewhere and have them make the food for me.. handing them frozen chicken and a mix of veggies was not my idea of fun.
__label__3	"I was lucky - I came here right at 8 AM when the pharmacy opened and the place was empty - thus no waiting (lines here can be ridiculous.).  Plus I got a bottle of ""SmartWater"" for $1.  Score!

Wish they had more cashiers.  (They also have 4 self check outs that sometimes don;t always work.)

A necessary evil."
__label__3	We had green fried tomatoes and the fried shrimp and catfish. Sauce for the tomatoes was great. Shrimp and fish a little mushy. Service a little slow. But after ordering the food came fast. It was at 2 in the afternoon.
__label__3	"I loved the experience! & the little shop was amazing! BUT I just didn't like when the staff allowed people to go in late it ruined our meditation session & they were being very very disruptive & annoying. On top of that the same people that came on late ended up leaving early which was disruptive also. So instead of our session being 45 minutes it was more like 30 minutes of relaxation & medication.  

They need to have a rule of having people showing up late and leaving early, just because it's not fair to the other people that book their session!"
__label__3	If your looking for a quick lunch break item and this is close to you, it can be considered if on a time crunch. I got a tuna melt and was not very impressed in the taste. Tasted like a tuna melt, but was cost effective for price. If you need something less then $10 and in a hurry, give it a try but not really a place I would actively go back too.
__label__3	I had such high hopes for this place but did not enjoy the flavoring of the food. It all had a rather sweet taste, the stewed chicken, the curry chicken.. The roti seemed stale... I really wanted to go off the fact they had great reviews and them being the only real Trini restaurant here... But honestly. Because philly is deprived of good island food. The natives don't know any better. Coming from NY I had high expectations of authentic, highly spiced food. It was just all a sweet mess...
__label__3	I just cashed in a Groupon for a pedicure and gel manicure. This was my first time visiting this salon and I went in with close to no expectations. The employees were very kind, I felt immediately relaxed, and although my gel manicure left much to be desired, it was my pedicure that stole the show. I have never been to a salon that put so much emphasis on massage! If you're in the mood for a full massage, but don't feel like spending the time or money, I would suggest coming here for your routine mani/pedi.
__label__3	"I came here for happy hour and everything I received was up to my expectations. I ordered 15 oysters, lobster rolls, sliders, and tuna tartare. I probably could have went without the tartare and I don't care for the fries that came with the sliders or lobster roll. I did enjoy my oysters, sliders and lobster roll, though the bread for the roll was much too greasy. There was complimentary bread pastry which was flavorful but ""heavy"" feeling."
__label__3	We ordered the Steak and Cheese and the Major Jerk, all to go. When we got home we noticed some issues. Only thing wrong with the Steak and Cheese was that it really lacked flavor.  A unfortunate missed opportunity.  Now the Major Jerk's flavor was exquisite and loads of chicken but we were missing half of the supposed toppings.  Not a horrible experience but of your taking out, make sure to inspect your food before you leave.
__label__3	The food and drinks are always good.  The service is always lacking.  Very slooooow and inattentive.
__label__3	kind of a dive, but the food is good and loaded with local Hispanic patrons. I almost felt like I was back in Mexico City, which I really enjoy.
__label__3	"Was not impressed with the food.. very pricey 
And not a fan. Friendly waitress and hostess."
__label__3	"Great flavors, but the mix-ins were a little limited in selection. It's easy to go overboard and load your cup so full that you have a six-dollar bowl of great frozen yogurt.

Be careful. Mass Ave parking meters are now in effect on Saturdays and until 9 p.m.  They were only handing out warnings when I was there, but I got one."
__label__3	Ribs could have been better...sides were good not crowded so service was good..BBQ sauce was kind of bland too.  Oh well!
__label__3	I really love the food here, but the last few times I have come the service was awful. Super slow and server forgot multiple of my items. She didn't come check on us and I had many issues with not getting everything I ordered. I understand they are very busy, but it is frustrating to only get half my items.
__label__3	"Very nice looking cafe, I ordered a coffee, oatmeal with berries, and a coconut macaroon.

The coffee was very good, however the oatmeal was not hot at all. The macaroon was very good.

Overall I'm willing to return to try other items, but they have to be diligent in checking food temperatures before serving the customer."
__label__3	"Wow everyone gave this such great ratings. I thought it was a bt dirty and smelly and whatever you need you can get from better places all around the city.

There were homeless people with coffee wandering around, and some of the food I wouldn't trust. The one reason you should go: Beiler's Bakery (Amish baked goods)."
__label__3	sales guy - I think Marc - WAYYY TOOO MUCH. we almost walked out - he was worse than the worst car salesman. luckily Les himself ended up helping us and we found a great suit for a great price.
__label__3	I was not impressed with the quality of the food and found it to be quite mediocre. For the price I paid, I was expecting more for quality and value....food should really be about a third of the price. The service was fair, nothing particularly welcoming or friendly. Would not return.
__label__3	Atmosphere is nice especially In the summer on the outside patio. The two times I've been here they have served me beer in the wrong glass though. Come on guys, don't make me send the beer back! Otherwise, pretty tasty bar food, awesome beer selection and not too pricy.
__label__3	It was dead on the Sunday night we went. While our service was good, the food was just Meh. (Not to mention TGI Fridays is one of the more expensive chain restaurants). I think I prefer Applebee's, which I can't believe I'm saying because they also can be a mess. At least their food is generally good. This TGI Fridays had high prices with mediocre food.
__label__3	this place is just ok. I got the iced Nutella latte and although it wasn't the worst coffee I ever had, you could definitely get better coffee at the Starbucks a block away for the same price.
__label__3	"Hey - it's a Wawa and was there when we needed it.
Cigarettes, bottled water and wait - Girl Scout Cookies?  Sold out of somebody's trunk in the parking lot.
And the DO have a parking lot.

Yay Wawa."
__label__3	"Nothing special to write home about. The names of the pho dishes were down right disrespectful and degrading. It was hard to look past the names of the pho dishes ""pho-tastic"" ""pho-nominal"". Clean eating establishment. The food was good but not great. I will be surprised if this place is still open in one year."
__label__3	Authentic Chinese food. Had trouble initially interacting with the staff but overall the food was good. Since I am a vegetarian, I tried home style tofu which was super spicy and delicious. Ambiance is cold during dinner hours. The service could be improved as the waiter keeps going in the back and I had to call him couple of times. Overall, I was satisfied with the food but not the service.
__label__3	Everything is great, but the satellite radio station they play for happy hour makes me feel like I'm at a 70's/80's live hard rock concert.. doesn't really compliment the awesome, relaxing, water view... I love this place...the great bartenders, cold beer, and calming view...but have left after 1 beer because of the music. Maybe this music is better for later in the evening???
__label__3	"Very good quantity and good sushi for the price you pay. very affordable pricing for the classic and specialty rolls. Quality was good, did not blow me away, but was good. Rice was fresh, the sauce was delicious and the shrimp tempura was the right crispness. 
I'm impressed with their covid precautions. You'll see when you visit but made you feel very safe, masks, socially distant, take out only. Will definitely be back for more sushi :-D"
__label__3	Portions here are absolutely hugeee! I had the chicken pad Thai, which was absolutely delicious and worth every Bang of your buck! The green chicken curry was quite yummy too, but a little salty. We had the spicy 2 and it was almost quite too spicy for my liking. Their spicy level is way higher than most places expected so be careful about that. Wait and service was a little slow too. But overall, food was really good!
__label__3	This is an okay place to eat.  VERY noisy.  The food is only okay - it's not special and is very forgettable.  It's fine - it's just not wonderful and memorable.  Service is okay.  It's FREEZING cold along the edges of the wall.  There is nothing special about this place at all. I personally cannot recommend it.
__label__3	Went there last night,my beer was not good coming from the tap of Coors lite. But,my wife long island was good tho.
__label__3	"My favorite trendy ramen spot.
Is very comfortable atmosphere and friendly staff!
The shoyu ramen broth was overall good.)))"
__label__3	We used to love going here on our lunch breaks from work and any other time we could. The other day we ordered the take out and once we got back, they left multiple things out of our order. We decided to call back and see if those items could be refunded since we didn't have them. The lady told us no but kindly suggested we come in soon and she would give us those items for free. When we came back about a week later, we told someone about what a worker had said and she told us they don't give away free food.
__label__3	The decor is fantastic and the staff are friendly. The coffee profile is a little dark for my liking, and the music is 50% terrible, but the atmosphere is otherwise a joy. I've enjoyed some nice events there as well.
__label__3	Food's affordable and service was efficient. Crawfish étouffée was yummy, shrimp étouffée was as delicious, and the ferdi original sandwich was to my liking :) But might nt be back if we visit NOLA again...
__label__3	Had a take away tonight it was decent.portion was large but they said i they did not sell smaller portions. There was plenty of left over, looks like Chinese again tomorrow...
__label__3	The food is fine. The concept of healthy food is great! I just left hungry, unsatisfied and unfulfilled. Needing to go across the street to Fresh Thyme for some snacks.
__label__3	"I know some La Z Girls too, so way to reinforce the gender stereotypes here.

The furniture is not bad but I don't understand how people are able to pay this much for their household items. Perhaps because they just eat cheap frozen pizza every night? If you eat like I eat, you can't afford La Z Boy and there are lots of cheaper alternatives anyway. 

Still I had fun in here probably because the person I was in here with is very enthusiastic about these products."
__label__3	"Nice place with plenty of outlets to power up! Some comfy couches to lounge. Looks like a great spot to bring kids. Concept is cute. 

You can order at the counter for take out or sit for service. The sit for service was pretty slow. We had some communication challenges, so double check that you are getting what you want. 

The cupcakes are super mini size but pretty tasty."
__label__3	I would've done 5 cause I love this place but actually waiting for my phone this time rather than ordered ahead. No masks required, no cleaning of tables, and employees weren't wearing masks.
__label__3	"We've been to several of these Cajun/Viet restaurants and as they all go, Hook and Reel is among the best of them. Great service and ample parking and they make awesome cocktails! Their house sauce is really good and I'd order it again. 

My gripe? If they're going to serve oysters, they NEED to learn how to prepare an oyster! 

Anyone who's ever had oysters done right knows that it needs to be separated from the shell. It's not difficult. The chefs in the kitchen should know this."
__label__3	I have been in this shop rite other times and really did not have any purchases  to make in this particular day. This was a meeting slot with another individual.
__label__3	Like many others in the area I was patiently waiting for this store to open. The overall appearance is very bright and welcoming with an open layout. It's a beautiful store. The prices are mostly comparable to Whole Foods and I felt like the only decent prices were items on sale which happened to be nothing I needed. The health and beauty section had a lot of good brands of vitamins, supplements and protein. The checkout area feels extremely small and the lines were long too. Overall, it's a nice store but I'll probably stick to Publix for most of my regular grocery shopping.
__label__3	We have eaten here several times and have enjoyed our food and service.  Also the scenery of the lake is wonderful.
__label__3	"Good slice, good people.  It was a pretty standard slice, but the cashier was nicer than average.

I ordered a house salad and it was pretty terrible but I probably should have know better.  It was mostly iceberg lettuce with a funky hard boiled egg on top.  Come to Penn for greasy stuff, not green.

$10 minimum for credit card"
__label__3	Workers are nice ... some. Food is good but they ALWAYS have a way to mess up our order. One time I Payed for a medium eegee but got a small. THEN I ordered an original grinder with no onion, peppers or tomatoes, but I still I got all that AND olives. I didn't know olives were ever on a original grinder. Smh
__label__3	We have been here many times, the best pralines in New Orleans. They have a good variety of other candy also. The store is always clean and inviting. The staff wasn't very pleasant and wasn't great at keeping track of who was there first or having a good serving system down.
__label__3	Sushi rolls are ok but not really top notch. The servers are nice and friendly though.
__label__3	Hope the Festival was a success. I have a concern my neighbors car was broken into and items were stolen. When will the rear gate (Wallace Road exit) be secured at night. Many of us have secured our badges to use the new gate system as it was designed . Is management and Freeman willing to improve residents safety by securing and support full operation of the Gates. Residents have been given ample time to obtain needed gate badge.
__label__3	"Sandwich feedback (get it):

Pro: fast reliable sandwich turnaround time
Con: girl that took my order stared at me very awkwardly before, during and after my order. Didn't offer me a receipt and then said ""ok you're done.""
Pro: two types of very nice toilet paper options in the bathroom

Bottom line: I've had better, more polite service, especially in this area of town."
__label__3	"I have been here a few times. My nails always turn out fine. However, they have a sign on the door that states ""walk-ins welcome!"", and the last few times I have tried walking in, I was denied at the door and told that I need an appointment! I have witnessed this happen to multiple people here."
__label__3	Very crowded and awful seating area. Won't be back. Which is a shame bc the coach seemed great but no where to sit with my infant to watch.
__label__3	The service was decent and the people were nice. We got the Swamp Platter and ate all of the shrimp creole, most of the maque  choux, and barely any of the blackened alligator. We weren't impressed with the food but I wouldn't recommend against going here.
__label__3	"Between the four closest asian places i frequent in the area, this is the lowest one.
Sorry I liked the food alright, ,but could be better! The location is hard to find to begin! Then the sitting is a bit unconfortable. I have not tried to order out, I would probably like better. Since it does take a bit longer compared to other places, at teh same time and comparing with the same amount of customers.
The summer rolls were also a let down :("
__label__3	"Fairly stressful if it is your first time. Try not to over think your order, just yell whatever sounds good on a pizza and it should work out just fine for you. The salads are really great, the dressing is the best part! Enjoy the ""in your face"" atmosphere and make sure you are paying attention when they are calling up orders that are ready. It's not Starbucks, they aren't going to be yelling your name. The pizza is worth the high stress level, promise."
__label__3	"Decent place on a Friday night, the atmosphere was chill but not my kinda scene.  I like to dance and the music was just okay but the DJ had to verbally encourage the crowd to dance...the music should get them on the dance floor.

They have Left Hand's milk stout and it's fabulous.  Sloppy pour from the bartender but she was very nice.

Also, the jewelry in the case, that is also the bar, was gorgeous and I even saw some pieces I would totally buy."
__label__3	Very limited summer menu. Nothing special. I'm sure their full menu is bangarang but I didn't get to experience it...
__label__3	My husband and I came here for dinner. We were seated and the worst table in the restaurant even though there were many other tables available. We requested to move and the waitress accommodated us. The food was good, but a bit over priced for the quality.
__label__3	"Quality has decreased as prices have increased. Losing faith in 5 Guys. Visited this same restaurant many times and this may be the last as it seems to be slipping. Orders were incorrect, soda machine was empty of most selections, and door took much longer than usual. So sad. Maybe this is why it's changing to ""Brandon Burgers."""
__label__3	"Probably my least favorite place on earth, but when I have to go to a Wal-Mart this is my first choice.  

Surprisingly clean, for Wal-Mart standards and usually stocked pretty well too.

Don't expect spectacular customer service, because you won't get it, but at the end of the day if you're looking to save some cash on the necessities, this Wal-Mart isn't a bad option."
__label__3	Great place for drinks, with many different unique beers (on tap!) to choose from and has a nice atmosphere. However, the food was not very tasty and highly overpriced. The portions were not large enough either for entrees. However, I would definitely come back for drinks only!
__label__3	Nice view. Drinks not very impressive. Over priced for what you get. Won't be back anytime soon.
__label__3	"Cozy place. Disappointed in the bar food 
Calamari boring bland bad Thai sauce  cheese steak egg rolls ok bad red sauce 
Based on bar food doubt I will return for dinner"
__label__3	Living in Boston, it's hard to find wholesome cooking like this. The food was more than what we can eat. I miss the South!
__label__3	It was very busy.  Sat on third floor.  Kinda disorganized was surprised waiters and waitresses did not have assigned area.  Tried ordering food and asking for no cheese due to dairy allergy.  That is not possible.  Everything is pre done.  Probably will go back only for the music and beer not the food
__label__3	Just after I landed into Philly INTL, I was picked up and brought to Jim's Steaks. Apparently there had been a mix up with not having had defrosted enough meats, so they were running behind. The man cooking up at the front was really complaining rather intensely and also swearing. It didn't take too terribly long for the food to be ready, and when it was, it was a really good cheesesteak. It was dealing with the staff drama that was an issue, if I was rating solely on what I devoured, there would have been 4 stars.
__label__3	I was so excited for mongolian barbeque because I had it for the first time in california and I loved it. This just wasn't as good and I was a bit dissapointed. I may go back because it's a nice change of pace, but I'm not sure.
__label__3	love the mac & cheese options and the tv dinner sides is cute, but not a culinary achievement.  great choice for after work hang out and drinks.
__label__3	I really only like this place because of Quizzo on Monday nights. I haven't eaten a whole lot here because nothing appeals to me. We usually just get wings and fries. They don't have cheese for the fries and the wings are the dry rub kind, I prefer saucy wings. The beer selection is good and the lemonade is good. Service is usually really slow since they only have one waitress, well at least on Mondays. The place is in a great area and is nice on the inside. I usually eat before I come.
__label__3	They used to be very reliable and consistent but their service has been slipping lately. The last several times I've used them the wait time for pickup has been 20 minutes or more. One of those times, it was another 10 minutes to wait for my car. The most recent time, my truck was covered with bird droppings (see photo). It's just not the same service they used to provide. I will be looking for other options on my next trip.
__label__3	"Fried green tomato eggs benedict.  Service was a little slow and my food was only warm, but not hot.  They were not busy, so I don't know what's up with that.  
Food was tasty and the atmosphere was relaxed, but nice.  I would give it another try.  Maybe it was just an off morning."
__label__3	This is an average place. The dim sum is decent for not having very much in the New Orleans area. There is a Chinese buffet here as well which is average. All Chinese buffets taste the same to me. The staff is nice. The place is huge and very clean. So that's a good thing.
__label__3	"Don't bother to go to the box office to buy tickets, they charge you the same $2.50 ""processing fee"" per ticket that they charge if you call them with your credit/debit card, and if you call them, they will either email you the tickets in .pdf format, or hold them at will-call for pickup.  If you get tickets on their website, the fee is $5.00 per ticket.  Don't waste your time going to the box office when you can get the same price over the phone!"
__label__3	Love this place! Everyone here is super friendly and eager to please. If you are looking for a quaint little diner that the locals eat at this is the spot. Good coffee, and good ole southern stick to your ribs food.
__label__3	Service was great and staff were all very nice. Food was delicious. But the size of the tacos for the price was terrible. These were mini tacos that were more expensive than a standard size taco. We purchased 6 tacos, a soda, and a single beer, and paid way more than we should have. And we were still hungry when we left.
__label__3	Prices are right, and I'd come back again when hungry for an inexpensive meal, but their chx and beef would not pass my wife's chew test. Low quality meat, but flavorful.
__label__3	Pricey to get in at night, and a lot of creeps go there and make women (specially college age women) uncomfortable. The only reason it's getting 3 stars is because glitter brunch is an AMAZING experience!! But as a club it could do better
__label__3	"It's pretty cool looking from the outside, and it takes up an entire block. The word on the street is that Chuck Berry still shows up to play a few times a year. 

The food is all right. It's pretty standard, nothing amazing. I was underwhelmed by the French fries that I paid an extra $2.50 for. I'd just go with the regular chips that come with the sandwich. 

The staff was wonderful. 

It's a good place to go hang out with family and friends."
__label__3	Nice spot for quick lunch.  Buffet generally has quite few choices.  I've never been for dinner but the lunch service is prompt and efficient.  A good value.
__label__3	I sampled five appetizers and liked them all and their respective dipping sauces.  They were full of what I took to be authentic Vietnamese flavors.  Among the entrees, the pork chop was very good but the other four entrees I sampled seemed fairly bland.  I don't claim any expertise in Vietnamese food other than having been in the country for a couple of weeks but I like the flavors.  The entrees at Vietnam Cafe didn't quite bring back fond memories of my visit.
__label__3	Lots of fresh options, but something missing.  Had the spicy chicken Thai dish.  They forgot to add chicken.   Tastes like a big bowl of cabbage.  Wife got coconut curry broth bowl.   Said it has no flavor.  Underwhelmed.  Will give another try.  Prices seem a little steep, especially for drinks.
__label__3	"PizzaMan Dan's is a welcome addition in Carpinteria.  They did an incredible job on doing the Extreme Makeover of that building and love the Corvette dressed up like a pizza parked out front, nice touch!  We ordered delivery service and they were on time with the pizza.  It was very tasty; however, 2 things come to mind they may want to improve on:  1.  the crust was not cooked - a bit soggy, and 2. the tomato sauce had too much of a sweet taste for our palates.  

We wish them continued success."
__label__3	"Overall, it wasn't a terrible experience. But ""Priority Boarding"" is a scam and the bus was late. It was very crowded too; I didn't find out until later that the bus originated in Baltimore. They should warn you when buying the tickets so you're prepared in case the bus happens to fill up."
__label__3	I've only been here once. It was really loud and crowded. It was tough to get a drink at the bar. But once the alcohol was obtained, the underground brick atmosphere made it easy for me to settle in and focus on my beer and my friends. This place's big draw for the geeks would be the robotica  around the bar. I'd probably grudgingly return here.
__label__3	They have two flavors- chocolate or vanilla (no twist) at least not today. The menu is difficult to see. I'd highly recommend a menu on the outside wall. They give each customer one tiny napkin and no extras where you can get to them, so ask when you order. Several menu items were not available and the person working the window seemed to really hate his job. On the plus side, the chocolate and vanilla ice cream are pretty good. In general, I'm sorry to say, I think this tired old ice cream stand has seen better days. It could really use an update.
__label__3	"I am updating my review. 
Today I decided to try chicken with cashew nuts, and guess what -- the chicken tasted old, like it was cooked earlier, refrigerated and reheated. I complained, and they brought me a new one with Scallops. The rest of the dish was fine!"
__label__3	This will satisfy your curry cravings.  Not as many selections but they are good.  Really cheap lunch buffet .  Friendly service.  Yeah I'll come back for lunch.
__label__3	Nice store with affordable options.
__label__3	"Yummy crawfish quesadilla made with Louisiana crawfish... very good. 

My complaint is with the pricing... the quesidilla, a small salad, and a coke cost me $15... which is a little outside of what I want to spend on lunch during work weeks. 

BOTTOM LINE: Food was good, but I may not return due to high prices."
__label__3	Not the same since they reopened, used to love their huevos rancheros but now they're just average. Above average prices but the service is good and friendly staff.
__label__3	I really want this place to make it. The staff was pretty good. I ordered a burger-Medium and received a burger-Well done. I was honest when they asked how my food was and they were more than eager to correct the issue. They are new to Uptown so I think they need to figure out how to better cater to the local crowd where they have plopped in a Bourbon St. style restaurant. The food was 2-3 star worthy. It's a bar laid out like a restaurant.
__label__3	Food was AMAZING!!!!  Service was the WORST!!!  Not sure if the waiter was also the cook. He kept leaving and would never come back.
__label__3	Inexpensive sandwiches. You can do delivery or take out and they've even recently added touch screen ordering computers like Wawa instead of ordering with the guy who is standing right there waiting to take your money for the order. I guess they have to keep up with the joneses, aka wawa. I've tried their Italian hoagie, cheesesteak, and chicken salad sandwich and all were good.
__label__3	EH? had a drink at the bar and asked if it was happy hour--bartender said yes (it was coming up on the tp of the hour and I wasn't sure.  I asked for a second beer and asked if it was still happy hour - bartender replied yes.  Brought the bill and for two 16 oz bud light pints----$9.18!  What is the HH price?  Haven't eaten there in a while, but the last time, the steak was indeed good.
__label__3	Pretty good servicing but preheated food. Waiters were awesome but you can tell that the food is preheated
__label__3	"Meh. 

Didn't live up to my expectations. 

The ribs were pretty good, but not outstanding. 

The garlic mashed potatoes were a bit gummy, as if they had been around for awhile. 

Oh, the French fries were served at slightly more than room temperature. 

Again, meh."
__label__3	"It was okay, but way over priced. Their rival (Boizao) was much better, the food presentation lacked, the waitress was only around to collect her tip. The waiters bring the meat around were lazy, trying to get as many cuts off of one trip without having to go back and get the meat charred again. 
 Next time I want Brazilian steak I will go to Boizao."
__label__3	"I came in after about a mile walk from Center City.  The place was packed on a hot Sunday afternoon.  There were a lot of servers and the owner was even there as they have his photo on the website.  I sat at the bar for exactly 15 minutes looking thirsty and finally flagged a bartender.  

I ordered three beers and the Unity IPA was well above average.  

I would have liked the owner to talk to more than just two people in the hour I was there and also make sure the staff was working properly.  In the end I will probably come back but would like more attentive servers."
__label__3	Good poutine. There was a gentleman doing some live music the last Friday evening I was there. I unabashedly sang along with him which most likely means the bartender did a good job of refilling my drink and the musician had a decent set. There seem to be a lot of regulars and everyone seemed to be having a good time.
__label__3	"We just arrived, waiting for a friend; sitting down at the bar. I ordered a beer on tap. At the time there were fruit flies flying around the bar randomly but I just laughed it off and didn't pay much attention. We were served biscuits and then my BF told me to not take one more sip out of my beer bc a fruit fly just flew up the spout of the beer tap.

Staff is great, so are the biscuits. Will have to order beer in a bottle."
__label__3	I normally don't write reviews but do look at them. Google mapped the location and saw comments about the receptionist and for sure extremely rude for no reason. I am perfectly fine with it because I didn't take it personal but I do not care for seeing others mistreated. I went for regular blood work the lady that actually took it was extremely sweet but the front desk sure gives a bad impression for the facility as a whole. Don't work front desk if you don't have people skills or enjoy your job.
__label__3	Double charged drinks. Cash and card. Not coming back
__label__3	Average Indian food on the outskirts of No Libs not worth walking to. The inside has no ambience - they just threw a few tables in there but it's mostly empty with no decoration and no good feel to it. I ordered the chicken vindaloo and the chicken was dryer than a dessert. The dal makhani was ok. Garlic naan was dry and not very garlicky. I recommend the new Indian spot that opened on 2nd near green eggs cafe over this spot.
__label__3	"After waiting for years to make it to New Orleans and try this Restuarant from Emeril, NOLA was slightly disappointing? My Waygu Skirt Steak was phenomenal! The stuffed Chicken Wings were not what I was expecting and just ok and the sauce made it somewhat better?
The desserts were ok and the Monkey Ice cream cake dipped in dark chocolate and rolled in Cashews was pretty good."
__label__3	If you like Indian food I think it's good place to eat indian food. I when because my wife wanted to try. And she likes it. It wasn't for me.
__label__3	"Pretty standard CT store, they recently changed the layout, so some stuff is in a different place than it was before.

Fortunately, I usually know where to find whatever I happen to be looking for, which is especially handy since I can never seem to find any staff to help me out."
__label__3	This wasn't my favorite breakfast. It wasn't terrible either just mediocre, ordered an omelette with tomatoes peppers and onions and got a pepper and onion omelette. My cousins toast was bread (not toasted) and it took quite a while to get new toast.  The bacon looked like it had been cooked earlier in the morning and not really fresh. Service was good however no complaints there. Might come back and try the waffle or pancake next time.
__label__3	Food was good and the service was average. It wasnt great or terrible however; the location in El Segundo, CA offered better service and the food tastes better.
__label__3	Been there quite a few times and really liked it at first.  Shrimp and seafood quesadillas are my main stay.  Very good and worth the price, $12.  Not worth the price is a $3 soda or a $1 for sour cream.  I'll bring my own.
__label__3	"The burger was pretty good since it was super juicy but it also means more fatty but it's a burger. I just got the Shack single so it was the size of a McDonald's double cheeseburger but it cost almost $5. Not a very good bargain.

The place was very hipster designed. The sitting area upstairs is pretty large. It can probably seat around 70ish. They have one TV on the wall and a shuffle board. SS also has their own beer brand and $18 T-shirts.

It was good finally trying it but it's way overpriced for me."
__label__3	"The food was very good. I got the ""street"" style fish tacos and they were delicious. My brother got a steak burrito and was unimpressed. 
My biggest issue was the customer service. The first person in the assembly line seemed annoyed and was short with us. The cashier didn't even ask us if we wanted a drink. I thought that was strange. 
They let you have complimentary chips and salsa which is awesome but half of there salsa choices were empty. 
Overall the food was good but I don't think I'll be coming back."
__label__3	"Good, yea very good burgers & grilled buns.  The potato salad or slaw is good and fries are hot but too salty.
Service is usually ok.
So-so beers in the bottle.
You'll want to sit outside as indoors is obnoxiously noisy and it has no redeeming virtues."
__label__3	They are more of a cocktail place and we were looking for scotch. The scotch selection is very limited. High marks for ambience and service though.
__label__3	"Looking to do some shopping and I was not impressed by this indoor mall at all.   I spent $20.00 in parking and nothing in the mall.  Maybe my expectations of a shopping mall are too high, being from Vegas doesn't help.

Well I guess we will try the shops at the riverwalk next"
__label__3	it's an ok place for quick eat . it's hybrid of cafe, restaurant and sweet shop . seemed overpriced for the quality of food ( entrees ) . the place is not very clean .
__label__3	"The room was nice, but just like the restaurant it wasn't worth how expensive it was. Also the complimentary breakfast was horrid, and the ""pastries"" only included 3 mini bran muffins. The valet lost our car and were rude to us as we waited on the rain for our vehicle. Other than that, we enjoyed our stay."
__label__3	"Came across he Red Hen while in the area with some friends.  We were looking for a bar to grab a bite and a drink before our destination. 

Great service! Our waiter helped get us in and out in the time frame we needed.  Great beer selection but the food was a bit ""exotic"" for my taste.   the whole group wound up getting wings and fries which were good.

I can't see myself returning if I was back in he area.  It was good  but it's just not my  type of place"
__label__3	We came back for the bowl of chili and also ordered the quesadilla, a sandwich and peach cobbler this time around. Chili and peach cobbler were good. Quesadilla and sandwich were meh. Service crew and the lady at the front did an excellent job. However, they were short on staff today and weren't able to open the entire dining floor. So, customers had to wait awhile before getting seated even though lots of tables were technically available. (Not the fault of the service crew but maybe better management?) Good thing folks keep coming back for the chili and pies!
__label__3	This is your standard admirals club. It is right next to security and is nice and centrally located in the terminal.  As far as offerings, they had the standard Admiral's Club offerings. I was there for breakfast so it was oatmeal, cereal, eggs, fruit, bagels, etc. The space was fairly open and it was clean. The staff was accommodating
__label__3	"Took a pair of my fancy boots here recently to get cleaned up. They were pretty beat up and needed some serious TLC. Gwenneth's did a great job restoring them and now they look as good as new! Very friendly staff as well.

My only complaint was the price. $18 to clean and polish a pair of boots is mighty steep in my books. I have gotten shoes and boots taken care of at much lower prices elsewhere. That said, this store is in a super convenient location and had great service. I will probably price shop before going back though."
__label__3	My kale salad has sand in it. Now I am worried if they even wash their vegetables. The pizza is not as good as Zavino's. The service is average. Overall, a very average experience and won't be going again.
__label__3	Revisited this restaurant again and had the lunch buffet. There was a good variety of tasteful food. The buffet/this experience was much better than the 1st time around. Will return.
__label__3	"I hate to give this place only three stars because it a great spot to go if you want to hang out at the bar and get some good beer and bar food. Their happy hours are rocking and the bartenders are always friendly.

I give the three stars because I wouldn't recommend this place as a restaurant because usually the service is pretty slow and myself or others always have to send food back because it wasn't prepared right. 

If you are looking for a good beer and a superb happy hour then definitely come here."
__label__3	"HAHA. Okay let's start with the name.

Spaghetti: a typical Italian dish comprised of long, thin, round pasta. It is frequently served in a tomato-based sauce. There is no way to make spaghetti taste bad.

Warehouse: a commercial building for storage of goods. Warehouses are used by manufacturers, importers, exporters, etc. They are usually large plain buildings in industrial areas of cities and towns.

Spaghetti Warehouse: Combining the art of pasta in a warehouse environment that makes many Italians give the evil eye and start reciting old Italian prayers while shaking their heads."
__label__3	Very small open kitchen concept.  Little of an industrial feel.  Decided to get the eggplant sandwich to go since the place was tiny and I was ready to be home after a morning running earns.  Kind of always in the way waiting for you food.  Sandwich was very tasty, comes with potatoes which were covered in butter so if that's not your thing than avoid them.  They were delicious.
__label__3	The place wasn't all that terrible to start off your night. But beware of the Nicki Minaj-wannabe shot girl. She will hustle you.
__label__3	The food was good, but not the best place to go if you have a lot of time to kill. The service went from great to very lacking as the dinner rush came in and we were clearly taking up their table for too long. We spent more than enough money during our time there and we're still finishing our food and drinks. Being rushed and made to feel uncomfortable seemed inappropriate. So if you go just be ready to keep it moving, since the seating commitments are not clearly communicated
__label__3	The food is good, I get it but their lines are like in and out. Except on a busy street all I wanted to do was go in to eat I had to wait 15 minutes just for that on the busy street as people honked at me. I figure it out
__label__3	The waffle was good, I'd like to try more, especially the ones the comes with ice cream on top.
__label__3	I have the good and bad with Circle Thrift. Went in today looking for kids clothes. Picked up a toddlers Phillies jersey, plus a book. Love the prices, alot of womens stuff not alot of toddler/kid stuff. Fell in love with a tv stand and a dresser there, but upon further inspection both seem to have been corroded with roaches at some point. Doesn't look like they are anymore but it still would have been nice if they had atleast been wiped out. No way I was buying it like that.
__label__3	"Just ran in quickly for some tacos before going away for the weekend, so didn't experience much of the menu. Chorizo taco was good, steak was not (very dry). The famed pink sauce that everyone loves is NOT so good - it tasted like plain old ranch dressing.

Good option in a pinch/if it's near your apartment, but in the land of delicious Mexican restaurants on every other block, I'd rather go somewhere else."
__label__3	Food was fresh and a little above average for an oriental buffet. My wife would never go here but she's out of town. Plenty of protein and greens!
__label__3	Tried it out today for lunch. Nice atmosphere. Had the lamb gyro and it was very good! The meat was tender and had great seasoning! I got a side of rosemary potatoes that were great too! I'll be back to try something else next time!
__label__3	"Why 3 stars?

Let's start by saying there is nothing wrong with DQ or even this DQ. 

The issue here is the staff and lack of care. Bathrooms were constantly messy, food was wrong almost every time and no one cares. If I come in, it is like they are doing me a favor to take my order.

With a much better ice cream place close by and even a new DQ down the road...it is time for a change. What happened here DQ?"
__label__3	"This isn't as good as the St. Nicolas Greek Festival in my opinion, but it's definitely worth a visit. This is more of an artsy-craftsy fair to me...so if you like Greek art and really cute jewelry, it's worth a stop. 

Oh, and the food is pretty tasty, too."
__label__3	I don't alway write reviews but when I do there is a reason . First of all the food just okay . The service ..... well we waited 1 hr and 15 min to get our entree which I mind you was plain pasta with cracked pepper . The salads no taste ! More hype than actual treat !
__label__3	I ordered the Lobster Roll although I heard good reviews from clients for it I was a bit disappointed. For $24 I expected a the meat of a whole lobster in that roll or at least more than my claws and joints. The waitress said it would be covered in butter didn't taste a drop. I don't know I just feel disappointed and maybe I had higher expectations. Not bad just not great.
__label__3	Very good location, super close to U of A and to the bars. Also the shuttle stop is just right outside the door. Downside is you can hear the train honks sometimes. If you are a heavy sleeper then that shouldn't be a problem!
__label__3	A typical sports park with an abundance of fields. Very close to Memorial Highway and I-275, it is very easy to get to. There's plenty of parking and the fields seem to be in pretty good shape. The bathrooms leave something to be desired, but it sure beats Porta Potties.
__label__3	"SEPTA actually did something right and brought back the cards, and with it when bought, included a pamphlet explaining that one should not keep their cards near their phones or magnets.  So that's what it was; some dunces thought they could pin their cards to the fridge with a magnet and took and MRI with them in their pocket or something and complained when they didn't work in the machines.  Dopes.

Thanks SEPTA for actually doing something and actively investigating the problem.

Back to 3 stars."
__label__3	Pretty good but perfer more smoke.  Ribs were very tender and fall off the bone.
__label__3	Today, my wife and I decided to go to your establishment and today I decided not to order the dinuguan( Filipino dish) don't get me wrong the dinuguan with coconut milk is good but the dish is too salty and the rice second round of rice they serve was smelled burn so the good server is replace it. But always want to come back.
__label__3	"The sandwiches are pretty damn good.

The Chicken and Chicken Club are my favorites, although the Steak sandwich is advancing up the polls."
__label__3	I stopped because I heard this place had the best finger steaks in Idaho.  Although I don't have anything to compare them to, they were very good!  The customer service was excellent.  This has more of a diner feel than a steakhouse; it's not a steakhouse like Morton's or Ruth's Chris just fyi.  The loaded baked potato was a bit disappointing-not because of taste, but because of the sparse amount of toppings.  I would give this place a visit if you're looking for finger steaks.
__label__3	Going to the State fair always brings back memories of being a kid. For starters, in comparison to the Wilson County fair, the state fair was just okay. Parking is around$5 and then there is also an admission fee. Food and games are the usual steep pricing and exhibits are at a minimum. Walking around the entire fair took around 45min. There are the usual impossible to win carnival games and the standard fried foods. No fancy frills or thrills for myself. Overall, it was a fun activity to partake in, but not sure I'll be returning next year.
__label__3	Was looking for a new breakfast place and stumbled upon Golden bear . It was a very cute restaurant and the servers were amazing ! I did however receive my Corn beef hash Benedict with burnt English muffins . Everything was piled on top so there was no way for waitress to know . I tried eating one half because  I don't like to complain and I was just plain so hungry but it was un appetizing... it would of taken 45 second to make new English muffin but cook thought this was good enough .... guess I'll have to keep looking for a breakfast place
__label__3	"The food here is great but the service is terrible. The staff kept arguing and disappearing to the back.  As a result my salad ticket just sat there for 10 minutes.  When I finally got it they had forgotten the chicken!

I don't mind paying over $10 for a salad given the quality ingredients buy I expect a quality  experience  as well!"
__label__3	"We had a group of 6 people come here on Saturday, I ordered a medium well Chelsea burger, unfortunately when it arrived it was more like medium rare. Took one bite and then took the rest home so I could cook it some more. Besides that the fries that came with it were spectacular and it went amazingly with the sauce that came with it. Our server was below average, when we got the check we waited for about 10 minutes until she finally took it even though there were only 6 groups in the restaurant.

Lastly I got the brownie sundae for dessert and it was amazing!"
__label__3	"Pizza is good. Pepperoni, margherita and pizza with vodka sauce gets high marks. 

Service dining in can be a bit aloof. 

Ordered a cheesesteak once and the meat tough and unappetizing. 

Huge portions are the norm. 

Stick with pizza, you'll be pleased."
__label__3	Decent clean Chinese restaurant. Good family style portions. Food choices were plenty. While it was nothing special, the family definitely was satisfied. We recommend this and will be back again.
__label__3	This place is good for a group since they have a comfortable back room that can be reserved at no additional cost.  The staff is accommodating and the prices are very affordable especially considering the huge size of the entrees.  All of the pasta dishes are enough to serve at least three people. The clam bacon pizza sounded good in concept but the execution of it left a lot to be desired.  This place is good for the price and the atmosphere but certainly not a knock your socks off kind of place.
__label__3	Slow Sunday but luckily the NFL pregame shows are on.  Great burger spot especially if you're brave enough to take the big ugly challenge.  Server was attentive....
__label__3	It's definitely not Machismo or Chipotle but the staff here are sweet so I do stop in every once in a while.  The chicken bowl here is decent and the free chips and salsa much appreciated.  The meat can just be a bit dry.  Portions are pretty generous though.
__label__3	The decor was great.  Huge aquarium in the center of the room that was bigger than most backyard pools.  Lots of large exotic sea life.  The food was good.  Maybe a little over priced, but we splurged for vacation. We did lunch and there were kids everywhere.  The place felt like an out of control daycare.
__label__3	Food tasted okay, although it was a tad bit cold -- a smudge warmer than room temperature. Service was slow and I wouldn't come back. A little expensive for the type of food but whatever.
__label__3	I'm back to update my review about the food. We finally tried the pizzas and they redeemed this place for me a little, but they weren't amazing by any means. Most likely we'll only be going back for half off wine and to chill out on their patio with our pup.
__label__3	Bring your fake service dogs here! Be sure they wear their FAKE vests. Management will allow you to feed your dog from your lap or from the table. They don't ask what services your dog does for you! I have seen it! Doggie, free for all. So sad for us who have legitimate  service animals. we all work so hard with our animals to help us. I just despise those who think  because their dog is cute, it passeswith their fake vests. Ethical people are ashamed of this! Shame on those old folks. They should know better!
__label__3	The halal guys in New York is a lot better. Me and my friend came late because our hotel was nearby and they were closing up the shop. The food, especially the rice, was a little stale, but maybe because it was the end of the day. The workers were friendly enough but when compared to New York, the portions we were given was a lot less.
__label__3	Pretty small art museum, not very man exhibits. The staff was friendly but the museum itself left something to be desired, especially for the $10 entry fee.
__label__3	A very good and laid back place to enjoy live music and drinks. The food is good too. I ordered the chicken fingers and daquiri .
__label__3	I live right by this golf course I have played there once years ago. It is always nice in the summer time. It's green, clean, great view of the wetlands, desert, mountains and nature. The only flaw I'd say is that they have there loud speaker a little too loud. I mean when I'm home I can hear word for word while I'm outside lol.
__label__3	Good place to browse and buy books, but not to sell books.  They just don't have the volume of business or the diversity of shoppers to pay much for books.
__label__3	Great bar. Just don't waste your money on the jukebox unless you skip everyone. I wasted $10 and never heard any of my music. Bull crap
__label__3	I've been enjoying N/S since I've moved here.  I've notice the last few times service was slow and not up to par. This last experience, we ordered the halibut which was tasty as far as the spices and presentation good, but dry. For $36 per plate... should be wonderful.
__label__3	Came here for lunch on the weekend. On weekends it's a limited menu. The service was great. Really liked the Bloody Marys.  Food was ok. There was no presentation, just the food on a plate/bowl. I was expecting to be a bit more impressed by the food. I was overcharged a couple of dollars for one of the dishes. I think it was probably a programming error.  My fault for not mentioning it to them. I'm sure they would have corrected it.  Will give them a try on a weekday when they are serving their full menu.
__label__3	"Driving around Indy on a cold a rainy night, wanted something different than any of the fast food chains in the area. Took a chance on M&B and was definitely impressed! The pizza and Stromboli sandwich was delicious. 

The price was a little high for the size pizza I got but the taste made up for it. I would definitely visit again though as the service or price didn't discourage me from going back."
__label__3	Good music scene.  Stay away for brunch, nothing special at all.  Food was mediocre, the scramble came out moderately hot, the buffet look like something out of a cheap hotel.  Orange juice was concentrated out of a bag.  Coffee was burnt.  Come for the music and a cocktail, that's about it.
__label__3	Watched a band on the patio... bought a horrible po boy from the nearby cafe. Felt bad for the overworked server. Only 3 of the 4 piece band, so the entertainment was only OK. I give them 3 stars because it was an off night.  it's worth a visit.  easy for the family. Neat statues of musical legends, hence the name.
__label__3	"Upgrading to 2 or 3 stars as I finally got to eat a mediocre meal here.
Service was much better - our server Melissa was a doll, but I had a rotten avocado sliced all over the salad I ordered.  Blargh!  They comped dessert to make up for it.

French onion soup (in a chicken stock??? Sysco chicken base?) was on the salty side, but good.

I think I have given up on Minella's."
__label__3	Great mission. Super great designs. Like, I love them. I would have spent big bucks in this place. As it is, we ended up with a sweatshirt only and a T shirt I bought 2 sizes up for a friend that I hope it fits. Just so you know, the T shirts are that super thin, super soft, super clingy material. If you like that fabric, this is your homeland for graphic T's. If you want a classic cotton T, you will leave loving the mission and T shirt wishin'.
__label__3	"The food was great. Had raw oysters and crab legs. The only complaint was that we came right at 9 (they close at 10) and we were told that the kitchen was already closed. After about 5 minutes they ""talked the kitchen into"" making our food. Great experience besides that. We felt really uncomfortable for the first 15-20 minutes."
__label__3	Zen is a good spot in Westchase.  If you want asian food and are with a group, you have enough options to satiate everyone's tastes
__label__3	On the road early thru Tucson and I was excited by Yelp for a good brkfst @BoBo's.  Yelp said restaurant openes @ 5:30am, but metal roll door was still all the way down after 6am.....would have preferred to be reviewing the food rather than warning to call before to ensure that Bono's is open.
__label__3	Not bad, but not great.  Tani is high on style and creativity, but the sushi is just not as good as Wasabi or Miso.  Creativity doesn't always equal great food.
__label__3	I've been here before but this time was different. I'm pretty sure my stuffed cabbage was microwaved. It was really hot and really cold at the same time. Potato pancakes were good. For what we got its kind of expensive but I'm pretty sure it's the only place in Tucson to get this kind of food.
__label__3	"The food was good the service was good. It is a hole in the wall joint. Very dated as others have said. I kinda like that sorta thing. One major thing that pissed me off majorly!!!! When the meal is over and it's time to pay she says "" sorry we only take cash!!"" Wtf is that. Fortunately I had cash but what if I only had my debit and credit card which I usually only carry because 99 percent of businesses take them. This should be made abundantly clear before ordering."
__label__3	Good taste at a reasonable price.  There are eight Tigard flavor to choose from, the ability to mix them seems a bit odd though because the flavor that are attached don't mix (at least during this single visit). Service was timely and friendly.
__label__3	Not my favorite thrift store, but only because it is one of the most expensive. They do have a great selection, the store is clean and they have a huge variety of items.
__label__3	When the Patterson House first opened I would have given a five star rating but I feel like the quality of their drinks has diminished.
__label__3	"Whoever decided to build this place is a genius!  Had the salted caramel, chocolate and red velvets last night.  So good. Fresh and fluffy....I will be getting more tonight for sure.  I thought it was sweet she gave me some minis for free...

I wrote this four months ago and gave it five stars, but since have noticed they shrunk their cupcake size.  Bad business ethic and I won't be returning."
__label__3	Nice selection of local craft beers. Staff not too knowledgeable. She had to look at menu to answer questions. I can read the menu. Their flights are ridiculously overpriced at $18 for 4 - 4 ounce samples and nowhere near competitive with the other craft beer establishments in the area. Bottom line, it's OK but there are better options nearby.
__label__3	Dr. Cari Reese is great however the wait time is ridiculous!  We've waited up to 30 minutes past our appointment time to be seen.  The experience her would improve significantly if they kept to their appointment schedule.
__label__3	"The food at La Michoacana is fairly authentic and usually ranges from ""good"" to ""yummy"", though it occasionally dips to ""fair"".  The dining room is nice enough for a date or a business lunch.  Service is mixed: While it is generally good, we have noticed a recent trend towards slower service.

Prices are higher than you'd pay at most authentic Mexican restaurants.  This would be fine, given the nicer accommodations but inconsistency in the food and weaker service force me to give 3 stars.

Note: Spanish-speaking servers are available."
__label__3	Helpful staff, good selection. Went in for jumper cables after a friend's car died, left with reasonably priced cables after being helped to find them by an employee. Store is clean, the line did get a bit backed up, should have had more then one person working the registers.
__label__3	"First time was amazing. Today was our second time and we are left very sad. We were told an hour to an hour 15minute wait. I went up at 1hr to check how much longer. The host says it will be another half hour. I questioned her saying it had already been an hour and that is what she quoted us and she said ""I believe I said an hour & 15"" quite rudely. So we left and didn't even get to order. As someone who works in the restaurant industry I'm very disappointed. The food there is great, the host not so much."
__label__3	They got good food but there's mildew and black mold growing on the ceiling tiles. Good tamales but they need to clean up their restaurant. Sometimes you can smell the mildew when walking through the doors.
__label__3	"Franchise Food . . . .

This place is always packed!

I tried the grilled chicken sandwich - Not too Bad . . typical fast food grilled chicken but at least it was on a wheat bun ....

Not many places carry Diet Dr. Pepper - -  They DO!!!"
__label__3	"Picked this location off yelp reviews and would try another location next time for better comparison- meaning nothing was outstanding enough to bring us back. 

Everything was satisfying and priced cheaply (in from Los Angeles).  Shorter wait then Hellas but that would be my next stop, next stop since there was no bakery at Mykonos."
__label__3	"Take out for 3 adults. They missed including a sauce for poke bowl.  Mostly it gets 3 stars becase the salads  with ginger dressing were very poor. It appears that the salads were in a too cold refrigerator for too long.  Lettuce was soggy and transparent while other veggies were just ok.  
Sushi was good, bento box was plentiful.  Poke bowl was average."
__label__3	The cupcakes were okay but not anything special or memorable about them. The frosting was dense and the cake tasted boxed (not necessarily a bad thing in my opinion, but you might as well buy a box of cake mix and make yourself 12 cupcakes for 3 dollars instead of buying one).
__label__3	The food here is good. Unfortunately, my waitress wasn't very nice, although I was with a couple kids around my age(20) and we weren't dressed like we were rich, so maybe that threw her off. The prices are a little much, but that's not their fault entirely. I liked the layout: seat yourself, main dining room cut off from the bar. All in all , an okay experience.
__label__3	Great location for walking to the arch/riverside...but that's about all it can boast. Our room was facing a brick wall, so we would have gone nuts if we were there for more than one night. Self-parking is very conveniently located.
__label__3	Great location with super friendly staff & nice food however in my opinion, the price just isn't reflective of a Greek BYOB. Two (small) starters, two (small) mains & one bottle of water came to $110 (inc 20% tip). Don't get me wrong, the food was good but $110 good? I don't think so.. I've heard the Sunday tasting menu is great value so will certainly go back to try this.
__label__3	Ordered via app for curbside pickup again. There was a long line in the drivethru so I expected to wait awhile. Surprisingly my order was brought out in under 10 minutes. Giving them an upgraded  review since service was a major improvement from last time.
__label__3	"The ordering system is confusing.  You have to place your order with the hostess.  It was crowded as we walked in because people were ordering right by the door.  Instead, we headed to the bar.  It was much better choice, in my opinion. 

The chicken sandwich -Roasted chicken , avocado, Swiss cheese, chipotle mayo. It sounds simple but it was delicious.  But, I actually liked my salad much much more.  It was crispy, savory, a bit sweet. 

Anyways, prepare to spend $. Overall, it was a good experience. 3 something stars."
__label__3	Food was ok.  The service was pretty slow.  It took forever to get our wine.  My friend's soup was cold, and her guacomole was overly salted.  I got the 3 appetizer plate, loaded potato skins, chicken crispers and southwestern egg rolls.  The egg rolls were excellent, the rest was just ok.
__label__3	"I'm a total Mexican food snob. After living in San Diego and Texas, I've had the best of the best - either Baja style or Tex Mex. Cancun is alright, but it's not on the top of my list.

The one redeeming quality is the 1 drink I had got me pretty toasted. Bang for your buck is always nice.

I probably won't be back here of my own volition, but I'm sure we'll end up here with some giant group or another."
__label__3	"I don't like giving 3 Daughters Three stars. I think they have such a cool set up in St Pete with the game rooms, stage and whole outside area, but I think the beer is terrible. Very limited options and none that wowed me at all. The Bimini Twist was the only one that was ""Okay"". But it really is such an awesome and fun place to hang out! If you aren't that much into beer, then you would absolutely love it."
__label__3	Food is tasty. Mad flavorful:) I had the shrimp pasta. Certainly a hole in a wall joint. But worth coming for takeout on a late night when you're in no mood to cook! They have a kitten running around the place which is unsanitary...only reason why I didn't give 5 stars
__label__3	"I tried the stewed chicken, it is with tomato sauce, tastes ok, a little light. Maybe add some salt will make it tasty.

Also the special drink called Homemade Horchata is ok, which is sweet drink with chopped rice and some nuts.

Cash only."
__label__3	I got some late night pancakes delivered to the hotel that I'm staying at. They were yummy! The service time for delivery was quick.
__label__3	Second and third pizzas from Mangiamo, a white veggie and plain cheese were absolutely tasteless.  Consistency maybe a problem.  Think we will trying a few other places.
__label__3	$35 brunch menu and affordable drinks not that the service was bad but they lack professional training and decor was a little outdated otherwise entrees were pretty good (crab cake benedict and fish of the day) but chefs/dessert table just had mediocre options I would suggest simply eating there for one of the best views of philly
__label__3	"I stopped in on a cold snowy day and found this place to be cozy and comfy.  I decided on the Mexican Mocha Latte which had an interesting spicy kick to it.  The service was just as warm and the toasted bagel made it all worth the stop.  
We need more coffee places like this."
__label__3	Great location right on the beech!! The patio is perfect, food good but overpriced and the service wasn't horrible but a little slow. Service started out great but unfortunately, our server became more concerned about leaving than taking care of us. This was 745pm so it rubbed me the wrong way. Not horrible or a bad experience just not great.
__label__3	Stopped in for a drink after dinner and bar hopping - checked in and got our free Washington Apple shots - delicious and ice cold- well done! Had a beer and a gimlet up. Only complaint was my gimlet wasn't even shaken and I like mine cold. Otherwise a pretty cool spot
__label__3	These guys are nice and do an ok job on the outside, but the inside work is poor. Their​ prices are good and there really aren't any great car washes in the Wayne/Bryn Mawr area.
__label__3	Stopped in as I heard raving reviews... I gave 3 stars as service was pleasant but I found the actual taste of the red velvet and chocolate not as exciting as I had envisioned making the 30 min drive to get there. I always give a place a benefit of doubt so I may try on another day.
__label__3	Bummer closed today  - covid-19 employee- so many disappointing patrons today - could have used a giant sign so we didn't get to the front door for the 8x11 hand written sign!!!
__label__3	They are remodeling and closed for 3 weeks. Even though their take out/eat in sign was open. We walked in to a full crew taking out the floor. So much for our dinner out tonight. Guess we will try back in a month.
__label__3	"I had an hour to kill last night before meeting the lovely wife for dinner at Chima.  I stopped in here and had an interesting experience.  I was overdressed and at least twenty years older than most of the crowd and was still made to feel right at home.  What a great little bar.

The bartender was very personable.  The drinks were priced right.  I didn't have a chance to try the food but I saw several folks eating tacos and they look fantastic.  I also noted that Yelp mobile popped up a nice coupon.  I'll be back to give them another try."
__label__3	Really weird photo. Is that a staple on a finger covered in sauce? There are a lot of great pizzas in this area. This is not one of them. It's not bad. The service was friendly and the store looked clean. The ingredients tasted good. It's just more crust than I like.
__label__3	Irony.  The soup was awesome.  The salad not so much.  Known for pizza (duh, it's in the name), I had a small slice.  It was decent.  ...  I would try it at least 1 more time.
__label__3	$11.00 for fish spread 1 scope of fish (good)in a bowl of stale saltines...no garnish onions peppers nothing.....go back to the Pub ways.
__label__3	I'm not a huge fast food fan, but you can't beat a place that stays open late in NO.  The staff is hit or miss.  The facilities are clean for the most part.  I know it's hard to keep things spotless when you have hundreds of wasted people stumble in and out every day.  It's not my first choice, but it's always an option!
__label__3	I'm only giving 3 stars because the food was just average and our waitress was pretty bad.  I got the Wall Street sandwich which was good, but nothing to write home about.  The atmosphere was cute, I love old-fashioned diners.  I didn't get to order anything from the soda fountain, so I probably missed the best part of the restaurant there, but just from a food and service perspective, not the best place I've been to.  Soda Fountain Square has it beat hands down.
__label__3	"Great food as usual.
 I would normally give this place 4 Stars, but they no longer give you chips, they charge you $1 for a small container of chips! 
I also don't like that the food is served in a basket covered with wax paper because when you cut into your food you cut the paper and food goes all over the table."
__label__3	The food was so good. Asian salad best Ive ever had. Try the meatloaf. The bartender on Saturday night was amazing. Our server abandoned us so he stepped in and took care of us. Not to mention, he makes incredible drinks.
__label__3	"It's Reno quality Taiwanese food. 3 stars 
Not the best had worst today but it's good for Reno quality where else can you find this type of food in Reno?"
__label__3	Visitng Tucson on a family vacation and decided to give the Good Egg a try.  The restaurant was nice and friendly, clean and service was good.  The food was good - not fabulous but good breakfast fare.  A good value.  The host was very helpful and friendly - all around a nice experience.
__label__3	I've been here 3 times before and always loved it, especially the coconut soup  and mango sticky rice, but this time I'm pretty sure my boyfriend and I got food poisoning, either from the pad thai or pork dumplings.
__label__3	My husband loves the dan dan noodle. I had chicken mushroom dumpling. I should have requested steamed, they served it pan fried. My entree was fish with wooden mushrooms. It was way too salty. I should have sent it back. Very disappointing birthday lunch.
__label__3	Food was ok service was just ok price was a little high for what was being offered. Felt like a fast food place. I have had better food at the mall.
__label__3	Food fairly good. I felt like margarita were watered down. I had shrimp fajitas. It was tasty. Their guacamole was very good. Homemade tortilla chips were good.
__label__3	We went to the stillery for dinner and it was good! You can go upstairs and there's open seating or you can wait for a table downstairs. We put our name in and waited for a table. We had a few drinks upstairs and then headed down to eat. The food was good and the service was good. I took 1 star off because there's only 1 bathroom downstairs and it was kind of dirty. I took a second star off because the restaurant was extremely warm downstairs. Otherwise, it was a great place and I recommend trying it out.
__label__3	This place is so-so. We stopped by on a busy Saturday morning for breakfast. The service was horrible and the food is basic- pancakes have a strange taste and a lot of sugar, and all the other dishes have little to no flavor. Someone else with us had the almond French toast and said it was good. Personally, I would try another breakfast place in the area (seems like there are several).
__label__3	I would had rated Ginger higher, because in the past they were probably one of the better Chineese buffets in the area, however my last two experiences have left me a little bit disappointed. The food seems to be average, with nothing really standing out as being great. The owners are currently remodeling the dining room, so it is possible that their attention isnt so much on the food at this time, perhaps this will change when they finish their remodel.
__label__3	"The nomenclature or the sauces needs to be adjusted. How is ""medium"" described as ""tangy""?  (That should be ""hot enough to need water"", no?). Ones to get: ""hot honey"", ""cajun"", and buffalo garlic."
__label__3	"It's Subway.  Not many surprises.  It's 3 stars because I'd say my expedient was average/normal.  The one interesting thing about *this* Subway is they have a drive-thru!  You place your order via a touch screen.  There was a credit card slot, but the machine directed me to pay at the window.
My sandwich was made quickly considering I saw only two employees and a few customers inside.  The sandwich was delivered as ordered. They were kinda skimpy on the veggies though."
__label__3	The food was actually quite good, but the service was awful. Our server was unfriendly and cold. The restaurant itself is small, but quaint with cute Sante Fe decor. Can't see myself returning due to poor service regardless of my opinions on the food.
__label__3	I'm starting to see a trend in Tucson: places that have high to pretty decent reviews are actually completely mediocre. Street taco is no exception. The food is just ok. The staff members are really friendly and the drinks aren't bad, but it's nothing to write home about. Parking is also an absolute nightmare.
__label__3	"I've been through Cherokee countess times and never really noticed this place.  But this past Saturday I stopped in.  Holy weirdness.

First of all, they were playing eerie Halloweenish music.  Then looking around it all soaks in.  This place is for freaks (not saying I'm not one of them).  Magazines on pornographic dismemberment, baby dolls in jars, creepy pictures, and books and music fit for every fetish.

I like this place, but it's not for everyone."
__label__3	Had high hopes for this place. Went in for Friday dinner. Sat ourselves, tables are sticky..... so we ordered margaritas , the server was helpful, so we got BBQ shrimp (not so good)and hot boy shrimp. Which we liked before.
__label__3	"I am not too sure what the hype is about. As a long time resident of middle Tennessee, I have had breakfast-brunch in many places, and this just ""one more."" The biscuits are lard based, so vegans need beware. Our party had the humming bird biscuits , oat meal (minus the banana preserves), the egg plate, the Lily, vegetarian grits, and coffee. Everyone was filled and happy, but not all that impressed. We all agreed that Sweet Biscuit Company in Mount Juliet is easily its equal."
__label__3	"Took nearly 20 min to get food. Default is apparently dogs without any toppings, so be sure you ask for toppings otherwise they will come out plain. After 20 minutes of waiting, didn't feel it was worth it to go up and ask for more toppings so we just ate ours with ketchup only.

Refills you have to walk up.

Lots of teenagers working standing around. Two were talking about when they were supposed to be off work"
__label__3	"Just for the record I'm not a huge fan of the Pizza Perfect Pizza. I have had it at the location near Vanderbilt as well as here and the best way I can describe it is.. Pedestrian. 

However, I'm well aware that it has its fans, and from the standpoint of the location, I have no complaints.  Parking is quite ample, and the staff is very friendly!  If you are nearby and in the mood for Pizza its worth stopping in."
__label__3	They don't take credit cards so make sure you come with cash so you don't get ripped off by their $3.50 ATM fee.
__label__3	Llanerch Diner was good not great.  As another yelper said this is your typical diner. The service was prompt and pleasant. The bathrooms are small and somewhat clean, just some paper towels on the floor.  I had the Western Omelette and it was good but the home fries were plain.  Could've used some spices other than the salt on the table. Overall it was a nice meal and experience.
__label__3	Not the best barbecue, the service was ok, not outstanding, and the drink prices were a little high for the quality. It took a long time for our food to arrive, but it was decent enough. The barbecue chicken was tough and dry and our appetizer greasy, so overall it was just an ok experience. I doubt we'll be back.
__label__3	Good ice cream but nothing to drive across town for - so 3 stars.  If it was closer to me it would get 4.
__label__3	I've been here twice to take care of immediate needs, and both times they delivered. Once was to scan a large volume of papers, which was done easily and transferred to my google drive. The service is always faster for sending packages and the entire process is easier (you don't have to fill out all the sheets fedex gives you). Street parking is usually available close by.
__label__3	Really hit-or-kiss with this place. The chain is expensive as always, but the food here is usually pretty good. Service can be good or bad. Last time I came here they were out of cream cheese and the Wi-Fi was down. It did not seem like they were trying to fix it after I talked with them and I came to do work using the internet...
__label__3	"I am not a huge Indian Food lover but I do like Makhni (Butter!) Chicken.  The lamb was just OK.  Tofu was the best choice to me.  I got a rice bowl but you can also get a wrap or salad.  For whatever reason it ran me $9.80.  For that price I'd rather eat at Chipotle.  (No beverage)

Price is too high for fast food Indian."
__label__3	"Great place to hang out with family or friends.. for a special event or just a regular night together. They have one half of the restaurant for ""seated dining"" I guess, while the other side is all active. There are fire pits you can seat around, play games and walk around and mingle with the others. The reason I gave it 3 stars is because it's a nice place to hang out but the FOOD is OVERPRICED for the quality of it.. 
I've only been once so far, haven't had the urg to go back"
__label__3	"In a word - ""Pretentious""
The staff hung out at soft seating area, smoking and talking 'shop' with their dog in lap.

Hostess wanted to seat people at that station and the staff advised ' they weren't done yet'. 
Disappointing that we got to share our afternoon with staff!  

Unimpressed"
__label__3	Fancy restaurant for sure, but their dishes are skimpy and really nothing to write home about. The service was also lacking. Again a bit snooty all around which is unfortunate because I was really excited to try this place for my birthday dinner.
__label__3	hostesses are nice. service was good. the atmosphere was extremely romantic, its beautiful here. but the food is not good. my friend got the jerk chicken, the skin of it was rough and the rice was bland. i got the korean tacos, $12 for two small ass tacos. the place is beautiful, more of a one time thing. when we got there it was extremely hot for some reason and the bathrooms are extremely dim lmao money is not worth the food at all though
__label__3	I found sunday brunch expensive and made out of all the remains of the week. The greatest thing I tried that day were the chocolate cookies. Too much too choose from, maybe it would be better to have a lesser and better selection
__label__3	Burlington, Burlington... oh what a ghetto store. Went to buy curtains, out of 50 samples only a few available and that in quantity of..ONE? Who wants just 1 curtain? How about matching? Employees are hard to come by, so you have to hunt them down by going to another floor? They are VERY friendly and helpful once you get to talk to them, but what the heck? Customer service 5; selection:1.
__label__3	The food was good. Price was around  $10 per person.  Salad is offered as if it is apart of the meal but is separately charged. Keep that in mind if you instead want to try a side item like we originally wanted.
__label__3	look at the sign and the time on the picture and tell me the two dont add up. this happens every fucking day and they change their times for closing everyday. pretty fucking stupid. like its not my problem you dont want to work.
__label__3	Came In a little after 9 am on a Wednesday place was pretty empty we were seated right away.. our waitress was fast and attentive her service was great. (ARdi) the food was definitely not what we expected my eggs were salty AF like pretty bad so obviously that spoiled my plate. The muffin was to die for it's huge and tasty (that's what she said). The house Bloody Mary mix was also pretty good. The potatoes weren't anything to rave about. Overall experience was okay but will not be coming back here.
__label__3	"Great location but $6.50 for a single scoop of ice cream.
No Yogurt if that is what you want"
__label__3	My daughter and I have been coming here for the past 18 years.  When Paul Prudhomme was alive, the food and dining experience were beyond compare. I am sorry to say that we visited last month and the food was poor quality and the service wasn't as it used to be. I'm afraid I can't recommend this restaurant in good conscience any longer, and it used to be on the top of my list for NOLA.
__label__3	Dinner: First time here. Had tenderloin on pretzel bun with fries.  Good quality hand made tenderloin, but a bit too 'done' for my taste.  Good flavor though. Great fries!  Wife had chicken sandwich 'your way'.  Looked good.  Kids had Alfredo noodles, no complaints from them.  Clean restaurant, friendly staff, pizza looked and smelled DELICIOUS!  We will come back to try that!
__label__3	"Good service. The food was decent but nothing I had wowed me. The ceviche was decent but small for almost $14 and my fish taco was bland. 

The pineapple mojito was ok, but the pineapple looked like canned pineapple chunks. 

The decor and lighting was a bit harsh, so it didn't feel cozy or a place to linger. 

I'll go back to give it another try, but there's too many other good Mexican joints for me to recommend going out of your way for El Gato Negro."
__label__3	It's ok.  It's a place for drinks...I haven't tried any of the food...just drinks.  Great chill place to play pool.  Service...eh.  Nothing to brag on. Just a place to shoot pool, hang with friends and grab drinks.  The sofas are comfy.
__label__3	"Nice decor, very upscale service (with much upselling), good to great dishes, bread and wine selection.

But is it worth $170 for 2, for 2 starter pasta dishes, 2 mains, 1 dessert and 2 glasses of wine? Frankly, no. I'd rather spend that amount on TWO dinners for 2 at other restaurants in town. So we are not going back there."
__label__3	Realized I didn't review them yet.  Haven't been for a while but used to get lunch here a lot.  The lunch specials are good, affordable & their lunch hrs are over extended.  The place is very low dough with little ambiance.  The owners are really nice, but sometimes have a hard time understanding requests.  They aren't very busy most of the time, so I hope they make it!
__label__3	The zoo would get a better rating if 40% of their attractions weren't closed. They're charging full price for less of the normal experience. All of the food vendors were also closed when I went (morning) and that was kind of a bummer too. My daughter had a good time, but overall I prob wouldn't go back until they're full open. Oh, they have a cool dinosaur exhibit going on bow as-well but you can't get into that without spending more money? Lame.
__label__3	"I eat here each time I'm in Boise. I love the Indian ""nachos"" due to the amazing crunchy ingredient. This is such a treat! There is something about this spot that makes you feel healthy!"
__label__3	I love the breath-taking view from the windows. This is a great place to visit when there is a storm, imagine seeing lightning from the 51st floor. Anyhow, the staff is friendly but the food and the music is awful and very mainstream. If I come back, it will only be for the view, and I will be wearing earplugs, as I loathe loud mainstream pop-dance music.
__label__3	Tried the chicken tenders - Nashville style with fries. It tasted good but was way too greasy and could not eat more than one at a time
__label__3	This Starbucks is always busy and packed, but mostly because it's the size of a large closet. There are only three tables in the whole joint, and I'm sure that's on purpose. With the number of people shuffling in and out, it's tough to be productive. Fortunately they have more tables outside. So if the weather is nice, you can enjoy some great sites of Indianapolis' downtown circle.
__label__3	A friend and I killed some time before work in Benna's the other day. Benna's is one of those places that I'm just not hip enough to hang out in. My jeans aren't skinny, my hair isn't asymmetrical and I listen to a variety of music. That being said, the iced mocha was really good, when I'm in the neighborhood again I will definitely pop in and get something to go.
__label__3	Great atmosphere...This place has been open for a long time if the decor is original...Love all the woodwork!  I had garlic shrimp fettuccine and it was good but not to die for.  I especially like the meals are served with dessert too and the spumone was on point.  Service wasn't impressive which is why I don't want to give another star.  Booths are great for party of 2 but not fir 4 grown adults.  I'd go back...
__label__3	Bison Witches is a standard Tucson staple, and for good reason - delicious sandwiches.  Come in prepared for big helpings.  Service can sometime be a bit slow, so be prepared for a relaxed meal.  No split checks - so bring cash!
__label__3	I was with a group that was looking for those classic Creole dishes you think of when you think of New Orleans, otherwise I probably wouldn't have stopped in here.  I hate to say anything negative because the staff was very accommodating, seating all 12 of us together immediately and without complaint and our server was very kind and attentive, but this food was not good.  Everything I tasted, save the crab claws which were actually really delicious, was bland, under-seasoned and lukewarm.  Luckily, I seemed to be the only one who knew it.
__label__3	"We love the food and they are always very friendly when we come in. The reasoning for the 3 stars is because the kids areas are gross... like gross gross. Dried milk and drinks on the seats of the games ( which has been there for over a month) candy thrown everywhere, food etc
We will be returning but i wish this area would receive more care. A nightly cleaning is needed."
__label__3	"You can call us Rays, but don't call us Devil Rays. Get an outdoor ballpark and these young stars would get an extra star. After seasons and seasons of signing over-the-hill stars, the Rays finally got it right. Evem so, get the old logo back. Just having ""RAYS"" written out in gigantic letters does not a logo make."
__label__3	The food is good...one of the better Chinese restaurants in the area (but not THE best). Their menu contains both the standard Chinese food plus some innovative specials and platters that I haven't seen before so you get a good variety of choice. The service is friendly and the food comes out super fast...but almost too fast. There were times where I felt rushed. They have reasonable prices so overall if I'm in the area again, I'd go back but wouldn't go out of my way.
__label__3	"They have great crispy wings. And their spaghetti is great with tender meat balls. Pizza is pretty good also. It's order at the front and they will bring your food out to you!

 Service is pretty good, I was able to bring my puppy along with me outside. I didn't like that there were no TVs on the patio but hey not a big deal. We ordered a side of Alfredo penne for my cousin, it was sort of bland that really the only complaint."
__label__3	Really good impression and atmosphere at this place. I was super excited to eat pizza after getting the delicious cheesy bread sticks. Ordered a thin crust and a Chicago style. Chicago style should be called Chicago-ish style. Instead of a thin buttery deep dish it is a thicker rolled crust. My big gripe is that they use a sweet sauce which is not my favorite. Place is good but not great.
__label__3	It was just okay.  I'd rather have diner food any day than come to this place again.
__label__3	Decent little bar that has great specials every night of the week. We went on a Saturday and they had $5 bombs until midnight which is a good deal considering we went irish car bombs. Solid place to go to beat the Kelly's crowd a block away but don't expect anything crazy. Also: very smokey.
__label__3	"Pretty good bar food, and solid drink specials. Some of the food came out cold so that was a bummer.  
The fried dill pickles were solid to start off the night with an ice cold Allagash White, perfect pairing. 

I'll be back to give this popular Philly spot another go around."
__label__3	This was my first time trying hookah & the staff was very helpful in choosing a flavor & demonstrating exactly how to use the pipes. Very nice setting. Sets the mood for a great date night. I didn't try the food on this visit, but honestly I wouldn't try the food at an establishment like this. They clearly specialize in hookahs not food. The menu simply isn't impressive.
__label__3	If you don't like crowds or subpar seating, stay away. Otherwise, awesome pizza in the heart of downtown Tampa.
__label__3	"This restaurant is no longer Vallartas at this location. It is now San Jose's and great food and service has been replaced with lesser quality ingredients and lack luster service! The Texas Margarita are still the best thing on the menu and if you order the half pitcher, you need a designated driver!

The especial dinner is still the best value at $14. And will feed two with chips, salsa and drinks!"
__label__3	Good food. Great service from Christina. Manager Ms.Hoover was helpful and informative with respect to a private booking. Food is of smaller portions for the price. Excellent venue. Top in the area for great space. Definitely short order cooks geared towards great appetizers vs full meals. Will be back.
__label__3	Decent sushi, not the best I've had the waitresses are nice. I got the all you can eat I ordered my appetizer as soon as I sat down and I didn't get it until after I got my sushi rolls though.
__label__3	This place has a really good location however, the food could've been better. The outside patio is beautiful. During the summer heat I would not tell anyone to have lunch or dinner out there. The live music is kind lacking enegry. The reason for low rating because the condition of the heat while eating dinner and the service overall was kind lacking as well. It took our sever several time to get our order right. If this restaurant is suppose to have island dish they need a better chef because the jerk chicken was a flop.....
__label__3	Nice attractive space, very clean and comfortable.  BUT..... the sound level of the coming attractions was WAY TOO LOUD!!!  Two hours later my eardrums still feel like they were punched.  (theatre #6 10am 4-6-18) People said sound level was controlled by corporate, not their fault. Well, I think the employees should file an OSHA complaint.  They are getting permanent hearing loss and don't know it yet.
__label__3	"Really cute place that always has a line because there are no other cute cafes in Ewing. We visited for lunch and I had a potato soup and a crispy chicken Caesar salad. The soup was fantastic! However, the salad was almost all white (iceburg) lettuce, which is typical, but this salad had virtually NO green. The chicken was burnt on one side, rubbery, and so dried out from being overlooked. Completely inedible. 

Overall, it's a cool place for the area but the long wait may or may not be worth it depending on what you order."
__label__3	Surprisingly good airport coffee shop.  The breakfast panini was significantly higher quality than what I expected, if they'd had hot sauce and ketchup it would have been downright indulgent!  The barista got my coffee order very, very wrong but that's okay, I mumble and it was busy.  Whatever frozen coffee thing I did get was tasty, but made me feel a bit like a 13 year old trying to hide the coffee flavor under copious volumes of cream and sugar.
__label__3	"You just gotta go! Bring your A game of insults. 
The staff does their best. It's a fun place to go and just have fun! Take the stick out of your ass and go have a good time."
__label__3	Pretty okay! Kinda oily for my taste, but place smells heavenly. I would try again, and avoid the mango chicken.
__label__3	So my first time at this place. I had a amazing time. However my Queen found a hair in her omelette. This was for me the turning point on how I felt about this place. The hostess did a great job helping us and telling the cooks to remake the food. We were worried about what came would happen next and well in short the next omelette was fantastic. Bottom line this place is nice.
__label__3	Modest place, home made tortillas? The menudo was good and service was friendly. I would eat here again if I were in the area.
__label__3	Had pulled pork, brisket and shrimp and grits. All tasted fine. The sides (squash casserole, Cole slaw, beans, and mustard greens) were disappointing.  Can't compare to 12 bones smokehouse in Ashville, NC.
__label__3	This is a great place to eat!!! Wings are very good and burgers are great. Chicken parm to big and was dry. Staff friendly and prices are good.
__label__3	"Came for the $4.99 steak and eggs from midnight to 5 (?) am Sunday-Thurs.. 

Service was good. We were seated quickly and our waitress was nice. I could have used a bit more water though. They don't carry cholula here. 

The steak was good, the eggs were fine, the toast was divine, but the hash-browns were atrocious. Oh well, we only paid $5! The menu looked like it had a lot of options and the restaurant was clean, though a bit chilly."
__label__3	Burgers are fresh and pretty good. It is not as messy as one from 5 guys, but also not as tasty. The fries are too skinny for my liking. The place is pretty clean on the inside.
__label__3	The menu is a bible - be prepared to be overwhelmed with all the selections available to you. I've never been displeased with my order. In a land of some really good diners, Amy's holds her own.
__label__3	I have been twice-the first time was amazing the second time was below average.  The first time every dish was fresh, hot, flavorful but on the second time the dishes were cold and some of the things we had (particularly the veal with the crab) had a terrible taste almost like the crab was bad.  I will probably give this another go hoping the second time was a fluke-but they need to be aware of the miss.
__label__3	Beautiful location but very slow service.  Food was good, but very disappointed in wait times.
__label__3	"Big menu, and great prices. The food was fairly good. Typical of what you'd expect from a nice roadside diner. 

The interior of this place is rather plain and in my opinion, kind of depressing. It does remind one of a white washed hospital cafeteria complete with plastic plants. 

The service I had was, ok. Prompt and satisfactory."
__label__3	I had the grilled cheese and fries, it was okay. Definitely not worth $11. If I go back I'll try something else.  The bartender was nice, refilled my drink, and got my check quickly.  There was a little wait for food, but it was lunch hour. I've been here for drinks before it they weren't bad, but it's been a couple of years.  We went when there was a big convention in town and the wait still wasn't terrible.
__label__3	First time eating there was meh. Smoothies where great and the service even better but my rice bowl fell a little short. The flavors where there but whoever made it must of been angry at the black pepper because it was a ridiculous amount. Everyone told me they're a great place to eat at so hopefully next week I'll give em a second chance.
__label__3	Had the Nasi Lemak, it was not anything special. Was hoping for a bit more coconut flavor in the rice.
__label__3	I came here for Mother's Day and the service was great from the door. I liked the appetizers served it was a eggplant dish from the Mother's Day specials menu. My husband does not like eggplant and he loved the way it was made he couldn't even tell until I told him. The entrees were okay to me it wasn't bad but was not memorable for me to go back. Nice employees though!
__label__3	The place was ok, nothin special. The server was friendly and I did like the band and female performer. They have seating at the bar, on dining tables, and high top tables. There's some room to dance as well.  However, nothin for me to return to.
__label__3	"A very calm and relaxing brunch place.  The food is affordable and good. The bison sausage is amazing as is the coffee. 

I'd say get something you don't usually get       
All of the food is very fresh so you will get the best first experience. 

The staff is friendly an attentive. 

Be sure to walk around before or after."
__label__3	Neither their yelp page or website provide a readable menu. I would like to try them but I'm not going to drive to their restaurant to see a menu.
__label__3	Well, another year has gone by and celebrating another birthday. We had placed an order for delivery to help me celebrate my special day. We had ordered the garlic shrimp scampi, Waltz shrimp, Cheese sticks, french fries, rice and chocolate cake for desert. I cannot forget the ultimate famous biscuits. Everything was delicious and we look forward in celebrating the next birthday.... One cant go wrong when you want good seafood but here at Red Lobster
__label__3	"The food is not like it used to be. Doesn't taste clean anymore.  Can't find a good Chinese carry out.   Any recommendations?  
This is all I can say.  Don't expect good food. 
Maybe after this pandemic things will return to normal"
__label__3	It's pretty good. Super small and don't even think of going on a Sunday morning because it's packed and did I mention- TINY? They had some nice coffee drinks and I enjoyed my egg scramble. Crepes were ok. Maybe I'm not much of a crepe person, too much crepe, not enough filling. Don't know if I'll return based on wait time, but food was good.
__label__3	"The food was fresh full of flavor perfect portion for each taco. We tried five different ones. 
Guacamole tasted excellent with fresh baked chips, unfortunately the size of guacamole was not worth $5 (chips $3 = $8 for chips and guacamole junior size

The ""Mean Taco"" had something hot!! I mean burns entire head throat chest stomach 
Shocking when you are not expecting or seeing or smelling anything extremely spicy hot. 
We will give them a lunch try and ask more questions before we order. 

We went after seeing show on TV"
__label__3	"Good vibe, good food, great sauces. I think the chicken can be a little tough sometimes but other than that it's a good spot.

My favorite time to go here is with a group of friends. Everybody seems to be laid back and it's no problem for the kids to be themselves here. Everybody is having a good time at this place."
__label__3	It was pretty good. I wasn't super crazy about my meal, but that was my own fault as I was trying to be healthy rather than just ordering what I thought I'd enjoy. I loved the drink options! Supper yummy!
__label__3	Very nice people but seemed like they were in a rush and my nails definitely turned out like they were rushed and not filed down evenly.
__label__3	Lunch buffet was pretty good for the cost. Overall the restaurant looked nice, the place was fairly busy (good sign) and if that does it for you, great. Made the mistake of stopping by the restroom which is way in the back...past several kitchen areas full of bins full of dirty God knows what. Some things are best not seen. Waited a few hours to post this just in case...no ill effects so guess it was clean enough...but not sure about going back. Plenty of other places downtown.
__label__3	Burritos? Decent. Enchiladas? Good. Free chips and salsa? Fantastic. Nachos supreme? Not so much. What is with Mexican restaurants in Quakertown putting CHEESE WHIZ on their nachos? This isn't the movie theatre. This isn't a baseball game. What is going on here?
__label__3	"Overpriced, mediocre food with slow service. Food gave me a bad stomach ache two nights in a row (I was a hotel guest and there was a snow storm which made it difficult to eat elsewhere).

A nice place to have an expensive cocktail with a friend but don't order food."
__label__3	After running into long waits for brunch at other neighborhood spots we ended up at Santucci's.  I opted for the eggs benedict which was very good, cooked perfectly and my wife had the scramble with onions & peppers.  My only complaint is that the eggs benedict didn't come with hashbrowns while the scramble did.  Odd.  Either way the coffee was good, service attentive, and food tasty and affordable.  No frills, good standby spot.  I might even go here first next time...
__label__4	"Delicious breakfast sandwiches! Home fries are great too. They seem to have pretty much everything a classic delicatessen should have. Looked clean despite it being an old building. Only issue that was glaring to me was a lack of ""Pack Date"" and ""Sell By Date"" on pre-packed foods."
__label__4	"Pancake heaven
Huge and fun - they use to have a contest to eat three and it was free... but even the local HS sport teams couldn't do it.. 

They're still coming up with new ideas and flavorful recipes... enjoy a family favorite"
__label__4	"Nice little restaurant.  

Pros:  Good beer, nice and knowledgeable servers who are without pretension.  The menu is on the small side, but the food is very good.  A bit eclectic (frogs legs, beef cheeks, etc), but very tasty.  The mussels are excellent.

Cons:  Smaller space.  The service can be a little bit slow.  Menu is smaller and some of the eclectic options aren't that special.  

Good little place.  Would visit again."
__label__4	Good atmosphere with great menu. You can sit at high top tables, at the bar or in more casual couch like chairs. Good place if you're by yourself or with others. Lots of TVs at bar too! Good selection of spirits and wine! If you're vegetarian there's an amazing Vegan Black Bean Burger that was absolutely and so incredibly filling. Oh and if you like sweet potato fries, you MUST get them here! And you'll never guess they're waffle fries!! Definitely a bright spot in the hotel.
__label__4	Everything was good. Pretzels bites were fantastic. We also had the waffles and tweet, which was good with the syrup, and their take on shrimp and grits; yum.
__label__4	First time I came here I got a buffalo chicken slice, BBQ chicken slice and a slice with rigatoni, they were the most amazing slices. I spent maybe 10$ but it was well worth it! The pizza was amazing and flavorful and I would definitely be back for more. The only thing I was upset about my second visit was the chicken parmesan sandwich and fries I ordered, the fries were soggy and the sandwich was absolutely bland.
__label__4	"Excellent raw vegan food. Even the omnivores will enjoy something on the menu. The staff is very knowledgeable and they are used to explaining their unique menu to guests that are not familiar with the raw vegan movement. Some of the staff are more ""vegan snobs"" than others. They all seem to have some passion for real live food. I had the mango green tea, pineapple cucumber gazpacho and tacos .  Real food served fresh with a gourmet twist!"
__label__4	Great spot and went there late night craving hot Chinese soup. I got the spicy fish boil and it was perfect. Made my body tingle but if your a foodie like myself that is a good thing !! I will be back.
__label__4	It's a nice bar. Food is good but more of a chain restaurant feel with a slightly limited menu. Better bar than restaurant.
__label__4	I got the $40 family meals, and it was a mixed bag.  The brisket was fantastic, thick cut, tender, and you can see a beautiful smoke ring.  Pulled pork on the other hand was a little dry.  The bacon potato salad was decadent, perfectly seasoned with a good balance of tartness.  The mac and cheese was fairly bland as it only came with cheese sauce and no crispy baked on cheese on top.  Both kids declared that my mac and cheese is way better.    Online ordering and payment was very convenient.
__label__4	"Yes, it's both - a dine and a dive bar (in the back) complete with Sassy waitresses (I love ""Sugar"") and a great manager, Vi.

The place is grungy - and up until recently you could smoke there and nobody would hassle you.  Dem Daze R gone, Alas.

I really like coming here - breakfast is great, lunch specials and even for dinner.  The Chicken Cacciatore - if they have it as a special - is a must.

I love my Midtown."
__label__4	"This is a family owned and operated vineyard. You cannot buy their wine anywhere else but they  can ship it to you. The wine tasting is $6 per person.

Many weddings take place here because the landscape is beautiful. Mr Flemming's labor of love."
__label__4	Came here for late lunch/early dinner with my family and the food was outstanding. They were exceptionally busy due to a local event, but the server was very kind and comped our 2 orders of fries when she realized they were forgotten. One order of fries is  an entire plateful here. The fajita burritos and quesadillas are outstanding. No concern at all about getting foods dairy free, either, if that's something you need.
__label__4	"This place was a godsend as it was one of the few places open late on a Saturday night.

The bread was soft, wiz plentiful without being messy, and the meat was tender. Their onion rings are pretty good too."
__label__4	Asked for a pie that wasn't on the menu (white with fried eggplant).  They had the ingredients and were happy to accommodate. Other half of the pie (complicated family) was onion & black olives. Loads of toppings, thin crust, speedy delivery.  We've got our new pizza place!
__label__4	Ii ordered the Osaka roll and the spicy tuna. They were both good. I can't complain. They're new so most of the time they are empty so it's a fast service. They also have their menu online and I have order twice and they were ready by the time I got there to pick up !
__label__4	Easy trail with some steep hills BUT it's still easy. There's some waterfalls and the hike is pretty quick. There's a nice view when you get to the top. I remember the trail being pretty shaded so that's nice.
__label__4	Went for a weekday lunch. Sat right away and service was prompt. Decor is fun, especially that fun glass globes light fixture. I had a short rib sandwich and couldn't get enough of it. I normally push the bread to the side but I couldn't control myself and had to eat the bun too! Also shared a Guinness ice cream and soft pretzel with salted caramel sauce dessert. My lunch mate fell in love with it. I would have enjoyed it more had I not been so full from the bun. I would definitely go back. Sounds like a great place to go at night.
__label__4	Overall I like this place. The fish tacos can be hit or a miss. Guac sometimes is a bit old tasting. The chips are usually pretty good. The sangria is pretty good as well. It's very busy doing you're looking for something quick make sure you go before the supper rush!
__label__4	My go-to Pizza place in South Philly. Very tasty crust and I enjoy a lot of their specialty pizzas. Also love their steak cut fries. Decent delivery time, and I always get good service.
__label__4	My daughter hooked us up upon our 1st visit. It's a must each time we're in town. We never finish a meal because the tenders are so darn huge. Delicious treat
__label__4	Comfort food! Chicken fingers and fried shrimp were done perfectly, Mac and cheese is really good, collard greens were also good, maybe a touch salty. Banana pudding hit the spot. Really inexpensive, a great experience!
__label__4	"Solid brunch spot. Really good food I wish I could have tried more. 
I gave it 4 stars only because its right by the freeway, so if you're looking for quiet outdoor seating this place may not be what you're looking for. But honestly we loved it anyway."
__label__4	Great class with Julie and very nice bikes: the bikes are much more comfortable and smooth than in most studios. The owner is very welcoming to all levels and self parking is right accross he street. Highly recommend!
__label__4	Such a cool spot we happened to stumble upon while waiting for our table at a restaurant. Had an amazing old fashioned. The inside is incredible with so many cool and thoughtful touches. If you're in Nashville- check this place out!
__label__4	Had white sangria with strawberries, and some cheesecake. Very enjoyable. Love the map decor.
__label__4	Nice place to take the kids. Food is dependently good, but not outstanding. A place where you can have a relatively quick casual dinner.
__label__4	Had brunch there with two friends. The restaurant is really nice inside- awesome look and design. There were a few different things that looked good on the menu to choose from. I had the cauliflower Sammy- it was sooo good. Service was good at first but then basically disappeared once we ordered- it didn't take too long to get food we just had to wait awhile at the end of the meal and for the check. Overall very good would recommend for brunch!
__label__4	Very nice place to visit for lunch. I have met colleagues here several times over the last few weeks for lunch here and have experienced great food and very friendly staff. The BLT and fries are always a great go-to. Their buffalo chicken wrap is also really good. My colleague also immensely enjoyed the tuna melt (on several occasions) and has stated it is worth the order. So, in short, this place has a little bit of everything for anyone. And thus far, all food choices have been very well received. Will visit again.
__label__4	It was in a ghetto ish area but we didn't have any problems. Just needed a room after a concert. Slept a few hours. Got up and left. Nothing exciting but nothing horrible. We had no problems after dark.
__label__4	Decent. Nothing wrong with my food. Delivers promptly. My favorite places around campus to get Chinese delivery.
__label__4	"Great sushi hidden in Moorestown. I've only ever ordered takeout, but the sushi is always freshly made (I've even had to wait for my order on occasion) and you can't beat the 30% off on Sunday and Monday. If they're trying to get rid of ""old"" fish, I wouldn't know, the quality is always top notch."
__label__4	Great bbq and sides. Baked beans are the best. Ribs are great.. wonderful smoke flavor. Pulled pork is moist, not dried out. Worth the wait in line.
__label__4	"They have chicken ramen for those who don't know.
Good for those who don't eat pork or are allergic. I asked why they chose chicken. There was no reply.
Went to ask, but never got back with an answer.they may have gotten offended. When I was just honestly curious why chose something from the norm.

The noodles were perfectly cooked. Not too hard or soft. The beothe for both the shoyu and miss had good flavor. Not too salty.

Should check them out."
__label__4	Usually I hit the buffets but want to eat less and healthier.   Millie's offers a decent selection of food.  Had the NY steak and Caesar salad.   The steak was excellent tender and tasty.  Salad had a lot of chicken and fresh dressing. Service was good and food came out and quickly.     Ambiance is diner like but spacious and comfortable.
__label__4	Drinks are always strong. You can and should go with sidewalk seating in the spring and summer.
__label__4	The best wings I've ever had at airport. Compared to traditional airport concourse fare, this sports bar in Terminal A is pretty darn good. The bartender was polite, quick, and friendly. Layovers are a drag, but at this place, I didn't even mind it. Although I'm not a golf fan...with all those pluses, who cares?
__label__4	"When I have the urge to dance I don't go to a scene and get drunk, I prefer sobriety (which I know is uncommon) with that said I actually enjoyed my time at Social house during Halloween eve. I'll admit my entourage said the alcohol was ""OK"" and the DJ was remixing one song that just didn't need to be remixed but other than that, the crowd was 21+ mature enough not to fight and dancing all over the place. What more could you ask for? Better alcohol, yeah that's one thing."
__label__4	Nice fast food restaurant serving breakfast items. Enjoyed my chicken sandwich coffee and tots on a visit to downtown Nashville. Seating upstairs, chicken was hot, tender and fresh!
__label__4	Typical bar menu with above-typical flavor. Half pound burger with fries is only $4.95 and it's great. Best fries around and the pizza is terrific as well. The piped in pop music is a bit loud for lunch. One bartender waiting tables, no other servers, but he's awesome and keeps up with the pace. Very friendly and attentive. Excellent lunch. I'll be back.
__label__4	The menu was unique and had some of the best vegetarian options in downtown Nashville. We were lucky enough to get a spot at the bar because they were booked with reservations. We had pickle chips that were a little salty as an appetizer. I had a salad and my husband had the chicken pie pizza that was super spicy but delicious!
__label__4	Kind of a standard sports bar. The food is good. I would even say the soups are great.
__label__4	Solid place for lunch some fish n chips and cold beer.
__label__4	Love this restaurant for Tex-Mex. Best guacamole in the city that doesn't cost a ton of money for a good meal. They have burrito bowels, burritos, home made chips, and great vegetarian options.
__label__4	Great staff and good service! The Chicago Dogs rock!! Plus they got filtered water so you dont have to spend a dime on bottled water, plus I heard they keep their ice very clean there. Great Cole Slaw 2! Love the decor and very chill setting close to Busch Gardens. Plus they got a good assrotment of all styles of hot dogs to sausages to choose from!
__label__4	"This place is pretty nice.  The music is fun, and the back patio is a good hangout spot.  People are friendly and it's fun to mingle.  The security is a little lazy, but they are all nice.  The one thing I don't get is why the upstairs is always ""closed for a private party.""  And if you want to sit down inside you have to have bottle service.  BUT, for a dance club, and for drinks, it's a pretty sweet place.  Reminds me of Q's which is what used to be there, but thankfully everyone there is over 21."
__label__4	Went on the last minute but I got a card because  I did not want to forget the name of this Diner it was really good
__label__4	For St Pete's, fun bar.  We went on a Drag night.  Decent talent.  No issues at all.
__label__4	Cute little place, good decor and very tasty food- the chicken shawarma was as flavorful as they come and their mezze platter was good - get the eggplant! The creamy baklava was a treat- I've not had this kind before and I loved it. Loved the fact that it's BYOB- a great restaurant for a good night out!
__label__4	We dined here for dinner on a weeknight and got a table on the outside patio. I recommend coming here to see a beautiful sunset while eating a casual meal. We have been to other locations but this was the first time at this location. Our server Jackie provided great service and was friendly. I recommend the fried shrimp, fried scallops, fried grouper, coconut shrimp, and buffalo shrimp. The alcoholic beverages were ok, way too fruity. This may have been a bar tender issue. Overall, we will come back for good food and service.
__label__4	These burgers were AMAZINGLY good. Sat on the patio, picnic tables and great service. Huge beer selection and a few wines, no liquor. I had the farm burger, with pickles, onions, cheese and the maple mustard on the side. My god, was this burger fantastic. Every single bite was as delicious as the first. Cooked to perfection and didn't need the mustard. Had German potato salad as my side, skip that and get sweet potato fries.want to try either stroganoff burger next. I will be back and have a shake too.
__label__4	This is a great park.  You can go for a quick walk and still experience beautiful natural Florida.
__label__4	Delicious!!  We have made this a regular stop for seafood!!  A fave of ours is the steamer bucket!  A well seasoned combination of Ruby Red shrimp, Snow Crab, lobster tails and corn and potatos.  One bucket easily feeds 2 and includes a side salad!!  The only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars is the service.  Typically the wait staff is not the greatest, slow & inattentive.  Food is worth enduring the service though!
__label__4	"If you are looking for a easy and quick meal, this place got it!  One bag of ravioli serves 4 people if you make salad on the side.  I loved their homemade sauce!  I had a little bit of left over sauce after using for their ravioli so I put on my omelet and it came out amazing!  The lady owner is super nice and helpful too.  

Note: one bag of ravioli and a pint of sauce is about $15-18."
__label__4	I always get the humongous banana pecan pancake and it's always delicious. But the service is very slow.
__label__4	Somehow I stumbled across this spot (silly me for thinking the Northeast didn't have good Thai food). LOVE the food here, especially their garlic chicken and their chicken satay. Like so good I'm smacking. On the other hand, I can tell that they only use whatever vegetables they have in the restaurant. I'll randomly get tomato or something that doesn't really match the vibe which sucks because I likes my green veggies but okay fine. I'll definitely be back but I'll ask about what side veggies they have that day.
__label__4	We came here for the Festival of Trees today. I have been to the Historical Society before but never to the seasonal events. We were lucky to come on a Sunday with free street parking but they do validate parking in their lot. The festival of trees showcases 75 trees throughout the museum each decorated from different businesses and organizations. You can also look in the different exhibits. It was pretty busy so it made it a little hard to get through each area. The staff were friendly and helpful. It was a fun Christmas event I would recommend for the family
__label__4	I have stayed at WorldMark Vistoso several times as a 1 night on the way to Texas. I have found the rooms more comfortable than staying in a hotel, although they can be more complicated. On our recent stay had to call the front desk to come up and figure out how to turn off the air conditioner, really? come on it's December.
__label__4	"What a great addition to our community!

We visited today as part of Free Museum Day after visiting the Chihuly Collection across the street.

While the exhibits aren't huge and impressive the concept IS; we both took information in upcoming glass and clay classes; they offer very reasonably priced classes in several principles.

Be sure to visit the glass studio located outside around the corner from the Children's Studio... amazing local work at reasonable prices."
__label__4	"Super nice folks....excellent attitude and fun...good music...decent beer selection.

A good respite !"
__label__4	"Four 5oz beers for $10 isn't a bad deal. We ordered cheese curds, a burger, and a mixed salad with beer infused blue cheese were scrumptious. 

Service was good, but a bit slow."
__label__4	"Great food, great beer list. 

Caught some music there, we liked this spot. Saw the Flyers, ate good food, enjoyed the Christmas decor. Off the beaten path, but that's where I aim.  Bartender could not have been cooler and friendlier.. quick service.. great vibe. Kudos. 

Did I mentioned GREAT beer list.. 3 beer engines too. . go. now."
__label__4	Okay I decided to try this place. I must say the 1/3 cheeseburger is actually pretty dam good.I like the charbroiled taste and the meat is really thick.I was really surprised on how good it was for fast food.The french fries on the other hand need a lot of work.I left all the fries.It had a weird grease taste.But the star is the Burger.
__label__4	"I was impressed by the quick service and they give you biscuits, butter and cherries while you wait. The food was good but, it did take awhile for the food. Having the biscuits to eat took our minds off of the wait so, that was a good thing. 
When it was time for the bill they gave us freshly baked chocolate chip pecan cookies that were delicious. A delicious ending for our meal! The atmosphere was firehouse related items and the building is historic. Beautiful wood floors and walls and walls of wood. 
Definitely a come back restaurant!"
__label__4	Great sandwiches at this small food stop. This place doesn't have much in terms of atmosphere and both sandwiches had too much cheese on them, so much so that it kind of over powered the flavor. I'd ask for light cheese. The bread they use on the sandwiches is sooooo good.....it's what puts this sandwich above average. They are huge and my husband and I probably should have split one. All in all a solid lunch but should not be a place to go if you are a tourist...try St James cheese co or crabby jacks instead.
__label__4	I have been to my fair share of Chili's Restaurants, and I must say I like this one. The GM is a GEM and the service is great. And the food is cheap, with great portions.
__label__4	"Prime Location. If you're in Reading Terminal Market, you probably want some coffee so this is your place!!

Overall, the coffee is just so-so and the service is okay. For as much hype as this place gets, it's not a ""wow"" factor in my book."
__label__4	Great place to grab some food and enjoy a margarita! Right by the water. Wait staff was very friendly.
__label__4	"The seared ahi here is probably the best in town.

This is the place that I would take folks who aren't real into nigiri.  There's a lot of creative rolls, but we're talking mango, asparagus, cream cheese, etc.

I was pretty impressed with the quick table service.

I've only been once, but I've been meaning to go back and try the bar.

Definitely in my top three in Reno for all-you-can-eat-sushi."
__label__4	This place is a great addition to the Belle Meade area. Came in for some light bites and a few glasses of wine, and will definitely be back. The environment has a cozy yet modern feel, and is perfect for a casual date night...the crowd was a little older, but there were definitely a healthy amount of tables filled for a Tuesday evening. The beef tataki was excellent--highly recommend it. Service was standout...they have a friendly and knowledgable staff.
__label__4	哩間意粉出品是我比較喜歡的一間 必須預訂再過去 週末人更多 哩度的意粉可以由自己喜好來下單的 第一次去的也可以問服務員有乜介紹 唯一缺點我認為是每張台間隔好少 能聽到幫邊人的談話
__label__4	I love, love, LOVE kolaches!  This trip, I got a St. Louis Slinger kolache and it was EXCELLENT!  This is the stuff one should take to the office instead of your ordinary donuts or bagels.  Just very slightly sweet pastry wrapped around all sorts of good fillings!  I've actually heard of folks who don't really care for kolaches, but I'm not real sure 'bout dem...  OH, and it's the only place I know that serves a pecan coffee.  I just LOVE that stuff!!!
__label__4	First time there and I was impressed. The service was fast and friendly. I suggest you try the pineapple caipirinhas very delicious. My only complaint is that that free appetizers you get are bland and tasteless other than that I thoroughly enjoyed myself. Will be back!
__label__4	Great little non-traditional bbq spot in Philly. Nice beer list and GREAT Happy Hour specials.
__label__4	We tried this place for lunch last week and were very happy with it. We were sad to see the old Oishi Sushi go as it was a nice place to grab some quick sushi on a weeknight. We got the all you can eat lunch option; I had the seaweed salad and a sush roll, which was surprisingly super fresh and well put together. My husband had the gyoza, the vegetable lo mein and the General Tso's chicken. All were tasty if smaller portions, which is to be expected with all you can eat! We'll definitely be going back.
__label__4	The food is just what you'd expect out of a classic Italian-American restaurant.  Very good leaving me wanting for very little.  The service is outstanding!  The folks here are a true delight and always have been.  You can tell that the family sets a high bar for their customers' experience.  Recently visited with a large group (~20).  Couldn't have been better.  Just go to Ariana's, already.
__label__4	Odd to order at the counter and be served at the table, but the food was god and huge portions.  Servers are very polite and helpful for those who are unfamiliar with the local food.  The gumbo was good and the Buffalo  shrimp Poboy was awesome.
__label__4	We stopped in here while visiting bourbon street because we wanted something fried... This place was good and packed! So we wanted about 15 minutes to get our food but it was great and fresh out the grease... I ordered a fish plate with fries and my boyfriend ordered wings... They didn't have public restrooms, which was the only thing i didn't like..
__label__4	Loved the margaritas and tacos.  The queso appetizer is not to be missed.  THought the prices were a little steep for amount of food that you get (most people would probably eat 2-4 tacos), but it's definitely a cool place in a great location.  I also didn't love the tables being a barrel... it looked interesting, but it leaves no where for your feet.  You either swivel sideways or straddle it awkwardly!
__label__4	"Imagine an upgrades Plato's closet. Everything that I saw here was in really good shape and well priced. 

The store is very organized and clean. Would definitely recommend if you have the time to peruse the racks. Definitely some gems in there. If you catch extra discounts at the right time you could definitely get a steal. 

I even sold some clothes to them and the staff is super friendly and helpful in the process. The communication is very thorough and clear. 

There's a parking lot in the back of the store with plenty of space."
__label__4	"What a great theater. Intimate feeling, small so you are close to the actors. I really enjoyed the play, ""Miss"", about a real event related to the struggle between a new Doctor at FDA and a powerful drug company interested more in profits than people's health."
__label__4	Millennium has redeemed itself. Under new management, the pedicures, manicures and general service are much better. I went in yesterday and left happy. While the young lady that did my manicure wasn't as great as the young lady that did my pedicure, everything went well. They're a little pricey compared to other shops in the area but the service was really relaxing and hey, I'd pay for that.
__label__4	Lots of deals on pizzas, so go online for coupons, and don't forget your Axxess card.  The thin crust pizzas are tasty, the plethora of salads are substantial, and the pastas -- especially the Chipotle Chicken Alfredo, are bang for your buck feasts. This place is slightly off the radar at the back of La Cumbre Plaza, but try it.  They always play sports and kids movies too.
__label__4	"I've driven past this place a million times, but it was my first time stopping in. I was surprised how big it was. We came on a Wednesday night and took advantage of the  $9.99 cover w/penny games, shoe rental, and pizza/pretzels. We played 7 games for only 14 cents!

Be sure to check their schedule, they have great specials."
__label__4	I never go to jamba juice anymore bc it doesn't compare to blenders' Tropical Guava smoothie. Dont even bother trying other flavors, tropical guav is hands down the best. I know its mostly icecream but its worth it
__label__4	"Atmosphere and service were outstanding. The food, was a bit average. 
Drinks and beer selection were also good."
__label__4	"One of the best Target locations I've been to.  It's a little bit of a pain to get there since it is located in an extremely busy shopping center, but there are always plenty of spots in the parking garage.  There is another Target near me, but I would rather fight the traffic and come to this location any day.

The store is clean, well-stocked, and organized.  I can always find what I need.  The employees have always been friendly and helpful."
__label__4	My husband and I were anxious to try this new Vietnamese Thai Chinese Restaurant, so we went for dinner last Saturday night. It did not disappoint, food was amazing. I had the Mango Chicken, and my husband had the crispy noodle w/beef. Both were fresh and delicious. Then we had the Mango w/sticky rice for dessert, that too was very good. The decor was simple yet elegant, and the waitstaff were impressive. Going back soon to try the Ph'o! Sue M
__label__4	I can't say it's the best ambiance, or overall good, but I can say I've never had better crawfish etouffee.  It's literally my favorite dish in NOLA. We can't leave without getting some!
__label__4	I gave this place 4 stars because the service was awesome and the live band was great! We were here on a Monday night after christmas day and it was full.  The walk from the French Quarter took about 15 min but not a boring walk at all as there were plenty of shops to stop in along the way. I ordered a salad, jambalaya, red beans and rice, and garlic fries to share between 3 of us. The sausage in the jambalaya was a little tart (I believe it may have been gator sausage) but overall all dishes were good.
__label__4	Really good food! Got fried rice and Thai chicken stir fry. Would ask for less salt next time.
__label__4	It's was all really good but seemed expensive for the price and a little bit small portions
__label__4	"I don't mind paying under $5 for a cup of coffee, espresso or any other caffeinated drink in general. With that said, I have been to this place a couple times out of convenience and I was pleased with the service, quality of whatever drink I got and the atmosphere of the place. Nothing special but nothing negative...

If this place was in my neighborhood, I'd be here on my down time to read papers or a book until I am certainly lightheaded from drinking way too many caffeinated drinks."
__label__4	Beautiful place, great service.  Some food was good, some great, none was amazing. We ordered the spinach gouda dip (great), chicken liver crostini (good), veal meatballs (good), butternut squash ravioli (great), goat cheese potato gratin (good), and braised short rib (great). Still feel it was worth going and will probably go back.
__label__4	Tuna wrap is really large and unbelievably delicious.  Back patio looks inviting just like some set from a Harry Potter movie with their gigantic huge tree in the center!
__label__4	"Not too bad of a restaurant. Actually great. 

the food was fresh and tasted great. I had the cuban sandwich with a side of kale and was pretty impressed. I would be interested in going back."
__label__4	"This is one of my favorite places for lunch take-out when I'm at work.  They have many vegetarian hoagie options: Veggie chicken salad (which is my favorite), hummus, and mushroom.

The prices are very reasonable and the service is super friendly and quick. They also have a nice little market area."
__label__4	Love their $5 specials!!!
__label__4	"Pros: Really good food, especially the pie! Reasonable prices.

Cons: Service is slow, hours are not very convenient and the restaurant has an awkward layout.

If you don't mind some inconveniences, I'd say go for it to try the pie and support a local business. If you are on a lunch break from work and have time constraints, then I would not recommend the Pie Pantry."
__label__4	Just another deli style restaurant. Only giving an extra star due to the fact that they offer really good pizza and food is good quality. Also the grab and go is very convenient.
__label__4	Since this location opened, I have picked up coffee and a sandwich on the way to work here many times. It's been consistently good, with friendly service the vast majority of the time. My experiences have been exclusively with the drive-thru, so I can't speak to the in-store experience.
__label__4	The best White Glove yet... Would have 5 stars but because obvious spots need to be pointed out for vac job i can only give 4... Best service!
__label__4	"A repeat trip to Sam's was an overall good experience.

Good service - a very attentive waiter

Good food - all courses were reasonably priced and very good.  However, I was not happy about paying an extra $1 for 2 anchovies for my Caesar Salad since these are supposed to be standard to the salad, not an add on.  

Although our steaks took too long to get delivered to the table, they were cooked well and seasoned wonderfully.

The good news for us that the food and service were good and a typical night out for us wasn't ruined by amateur wait staff."
__label__4	"Tried here again on Friday night, and had a much more positive experience overall. Kids' drinks were offered with their meals this time (yay!). Everyone's food was hot and quick, and the place was pretty clean. Surprisingly not super busy around 7pm.

During this visit I got the fish tacos, which were very filling! And I preferred the hot salsa this time. 

Above-average service, and decent value for the portions you get. Looks like the menu was updated/clarified, too. 

Still not my favorite but pretty good. I'll probably go back!"
__label__4	Great sports bar with a friendly atmosphere and staff. Wide variety of craft beers and get a large selection for food. Daily deals and affordable prices.
__label__4	Good pizza, awesome staff! The staff here were super friendly and great with our kids! They gave them stickers and made sure to put our super hot pizza out of reach of little hands! The pizza was really good and huge! We will definitely go back!
__label__4	Happy find in Reno. Taiwanese restaurant that also serves boba, yes! My favorites were the beef noodle soup, and popcorn chicken. The ground pork noodle was ok. Large boba milk tea was ok if you're craving it, otherwise I say skip. $45 for 3 people, not bad. Nice and friendly service.
__label__4	The food was very good, fresh and delicious. Service was fast and friendly. I appreciated that the pastry was not overly sweet. I will definitely be coming back next time I'm in town
__label__4	We tried the charbroiled oysters at drago's and acme and acme won hands down. The crawfish puppies were also naughty and delicious. Solid Bloody Mary. Great for a quick casual snack or lunch.
__label__4	First visit say a little rough. Receptionist wasnt very helpful but the second visit was much better.  Both time problems seemed to be fixed and service  completed was good
__label__4	Beautiful place. Very clean. Expensive and you will walk your feet off. Bring your wallet and your tennis shoes. If you are planning on going more than once a year, buy the membership.
__label__4	Fries duck skins a must!  Make sure you wrap them up with the bib lettuce.  The arugula salad with roasted fennel was delicate and delicious.  Skip the bahn mi pork tacos though.  Nothing bahn mi about them.  Needed more pickled vegetables, cilantro and basil.
__label__4	A little bit of a wait but worth it. The shrimp and grits was delicious. Also enjoyed the Ruby Slipper Mimosa to start the morning off right
__label__4	Excellent quality of food. Calamari is one of my favourite appetizers and quite particular with it, but I have to say it's one of the best calamari I've tasted... I'm impressed. I enjoyed the food but presentation needs a bit of improvement. Other than that, everything is great!
__label__4	The quality had gone down since Bruno sold to, what I understand to be, his partner and nephew, but last night they seemed to have rebounded. All 3 entrees - 2 of which were specials- were superb. If my next visit is similar to last night's, I'm gonna give them 5 stars again.
__label__4	The Tea Smoked Duck was crispy and delicious as were the Dan Dan Noodles.  Affordable prices for delicious food.  The Scallion Pancakes weren't the best but overall the meal was great.  We will definitely return.
__label__4	"Cappy's isn't Crappy's.  

This delightful breakfast cafe is a wonderful Tucson gem that serves great breakfast food all day and some lunch dishes as well..  The pancakes are delicious and the service is fantastic.  They have Omelets, pancakes, waffles and Mexican flare dishes as well: breakfast burritos, breakfast tamales and breakfast enchiladas.  

Skip the Denny's, First Watch and Mimi's in the area and go to  CAPPY's you definitely won't be disappointed."
__label__4	Me and some coworkers went here for a birthday dinner and i had the fish sandwich with a kale salad it was delicious i will be visiting again everyone loved their food...the server was very polite she actually went over the menu with everyone who had a question we were seated promptly very nice atmosphere...Oh and by the way the waitress name is Jenny shout out to her.
__label__4	Well I got lost finding the place but was delighted with the food! We all agreed the food was very good !! Top picks for me was the fried rice  with my dish  and the shrimp rolls was the best! I  was surprised when I opened the container and ate one!  I recommend them! Overall nice place to eat at again & I  will!
__label__4	I'm visiting Nashville and came with my daughter shopping. Indianapolis has two Trader Joes and they are both larger. It's obvious that Nashville needs another and/or larger trader joes with decent parking. The parking situation is downright dangerous!!
__label__4	I just want to update this experience. They did get back to me, and then I spoke with Megan the manager, who was very nice and apologetic.  She went above and beyond to remedy the situation worthy of a 5 star.  Thank you for that.  Unfortunately, the first couple shocks still leave us iffy with the cakes.
__label__4	"In a sea of chain restaurants in Greenwood Indiana, we were happy to find this mini chain restaurant. 

Extra ordinary service and good food. I was glad we wound up here for blackened mahi and shrimp pasta instead of going to bonefish. 

On a Wednesday night, it was obvious the management and staff here go out of their way to make sure their customers are happy."
__label__4	"After shopping here since this location opened this writer has begun to realize that the selection is not as large and varied as first impression would suggest.

The French section hardly ever changes, which is a shame given the fantastic quality and variety in all regions of France.  Why not get rid of all that over-priced claret and stock more from the Languedoc-Roussillon?

This writer senses that Total Wines has exclusive relationships with certain producers hence the repetition.  What should be understood for continued growth is that wine lovers like variety and that tasting the some old producers grows boring."
__label__4	My second time here. The chocolate mud slide was the best. Made with ice cream and whipped cream and shaved dark chocolate chips. Just enough Kaluha and vodka. Next time I'm getting the flight because they have so many flavors I want to try.
__label__4	Great breakfast for anyone on the run! Staff is extremely polite and the food was good. Very homey establishment.
__label__4	After a week of being buried in snow, a 73° day felt like heaven! I'm not doing indoor dining yet, so I looked for a patio in one of my favorite neighborhoods, The Gulch. Bar Louie provided us a beautiful spot in the sun and a delicious lunch. The staff was very nice, the restaurant followed protocols and the sunshine and food fed our souls--he had a hamburger, I had a salad. We left happy!
__label__4	Great location! Danielle (at the front desk) was helpful recommending local restaurants. Fun place to stay if you're on a budget and still want a beach front property.
__label__4	I ordered the iced chai latte and there was a lot if not too much milk. I tasted more milk than I could chai. The building itself is nice, small, but nice. The employees get your order ready quickly and have it ready as soon as possible (which is great since when I went, I didn't have a whole lot of time). Employees were nice and efficient when it came to serving their costumers.
__label__4	A nice selection of stuff, but be forewarned--as it goes with all thrift stores, you have to dig through EVERYTHING to get to the good stuff.  Items are well priced and the place is, for the most part, pretty well organized.  It's also pretty cool that there's an upstairs level with even more stuff!  An added bonus, the staff is friendly and accommodating as well.
__label__4	AYCE sushi! Conveniently located in the mall and ambience is great! Wait staff promptly greeted and escorted us. Inside is spacious. Food is decent
__label__4	"We came here for a quick lunch and it was a great option.

Pros:
+ Plenty of vegetarian options - yes they do have real sandwiches that are more than just lettuce and a slice of tomato between two slices of bread
+ Huge variety
+ Healthy options - Turkey artichoke is my favorite!!!!

Cons:
- The prices are a little expensive for just a sandwich, but the quality of the sandwich is definitely worth it!"
__label__4	Great selection of italian food and a really nice atmosphere. Good for date night or going out with friends and family.
__label__4	The burgers are sssoooo good! And the wait wasn't long at all for such a quality burger!!!
__label__4	This place was amazing! I can do without the fried okra as it was more stringy and burnt tasting to me. The oysters took me back to New Orleans...it  was soooo good! Everything was amazing and I will definitely visit again
__label__4	"My wife and I went here with a group of 8. The food was fantastic, we got the seafood latiffe and early menu coconut shrimp. For the price you can't beat the quality of food!

Small downside was the pace of service, not the quickest bunch.."
__label__4	It is a bit confusing when you first enter the place because they have combined space with the Mexican place adjacent to their store.  There are also three chalkboard menus which also makes ordering confusing and not knowing where to pick up your order.  But the sandwiches are hearty and tasty with some great combinations. They have lots of options including salads, wraps and sandwiches along with some hot entrees (microwaved) too.  The also have a good array of soft drinks, iced coffee, iced tea and lemonade.
__label__4	Wish I had found this place sooner but now I know and will definitely be back when I am in town.  This place is a HIT!!  Had the pork grillade, YUMMY!  I would redo the pricing for the juice drinks though, I paid almost 8 dollars for watermelon lemonade with a shot of wheat grass and cucumber, a little steep.
__label__4	I went there today to adopt a dog that was going to be euthanized. Like many of you I wish I could take them all home, I guess that why I'm writing this review to create more awareness of the need of shelter pets adoption.the facility was clean and the employees were very helpful. There were a lot of people so the process took longer than expected. If you ever want to give a dog/ cat a home, visit a animal shelter first.
__label__4	My favorite (slightly pricey) restaurant on the east side for brunch. However, the place is busy and parking at this crowded strip mall is nobody's idea of fun, so unless I'm hungry during off hours I don't even consider going here.
__label__4	"great nite out with friends at the blue fig. attentive service and fantastic food. I am always looking for local eateries that serve weight watcher friendly fare. the blue fig did just that. grilled kabobs, fresh local veggies and yummy coscuos. what could be better?
just a tad on the pricey side, but well worth it."
__label__4	I don't think you can make an adequate complaint about this place.  this hotel is gorgeous.  The rooms are big.  Some rooms have sleep number beds.  You couldn't ask for a better location.  I guess you can complain about paying for parking and the loud area from outside.  Well, you decided to stay downtown...what did you expect?
__label__4	GREAT ATMOSPHERE. High energy. Nice bar. Excellent service. Food good, overall.  Steaks were great. Caesar salad, baked shrimp - pretty good. Beef Carpaccio app was great. Sides just average. Piano guy was a nice touch, but everyone was talking over the music, so the noise in the dining room was EXTREMELY LOUD!!! Maybe they should move the piano guy further into the bar.
__label__4	I have been to Hoki Poki Three times and really enjoy the poki bowls. The ordering system is nice and easy. My bowls have always been portioned to my expectations. I get tuna and salmon and both are very fresh pieces of fish. Try this place out. The eel sauce makes the dish that much more. :)
__label__4	Great mall! Good selection of stores. Very nice food court and some anchor Restuarants like Changs. Also Movies.
__label__4	Wasn't bad! If you're just looking for a bagel and schmear, this is you place. Breakfast sandwich was just okay, but maybe I didn't pick the right stuff for mine. Good and friendly staff. Would go back in the future.
__label__4	"Food super yummy!!!! Finally an awesome spot we enjoy! 

I usually get the paper steak and it's so tasty. 

Reception service could be a bit more covered and well managed. 

But the people are very nice and the food is yummy!"
__label__4	So many choices and so little time!! I had the pistachio and salted caramel together, quite yummy. Husband had Mango and licked his cup clean. We'll be back. Wish the servers were a tad friendlier but it was late and near closing. I'll come earlier next tim and let you know!
__label__4	I think this is great Chinese food for the price.  I always order the beef with broccoli.  Always is a ton of food and the beef is pretty tender.
__label__4	"I stopped here as my usual beach/parking area was experiencing a typical Florida thundershower the day I was heading to the beach.  I drove south until the sun came out and ended up in Madeira Beach (in the vicinity of the Archibald Beach Park area due to the plentiful parking found here).  

It was a weekday, which led to easy parking and finding a nice spot on the beach.  It was a generally well kept area, although you could see the metal seawalls every 20 feet or so.  Still a pretty good place to experience the gulf coast beaches that the Tampa Bay area is known for."
__label__4	"Balducci's has been the best pizza I've had in St. Louis.   Both the thin-crust and deep dish pizzas are worth trying.  I've been here several times and the pizza has been consistently good each time.
If you have room for dessert afterward, then don't pass up on the cheesecake."
__label__4	Pretty good sushi and very affordable. I love the decor and the waitress was attentive and friendly. I wasn't crazy about the bubble tea flavor but all in all a good experience.
__label__4	I always have such a hard time going to these type of places with friends because I am vegan. But Bitter Bobs actually has a very, very tasty vegan sandwich called the Treehugger! It is barbequed seitan on a multigrain bun with some tasty sweet potato fries! I am looking forward to my next visit with my meat eating fiancee!
__label__4	Been to Ole Saint a few times, nice people and yummy food. Felt like the bartender lady that was helping us had a little attitude but she warmed up to us and everything worked out. The mac and cheese is just okay but would not recommend. Would go back to Ole Saint and try more things out.
__label__4	I was very happy (and surprised) at how good this Cheesesteak was.  I have to admit that I went to James Street Tavern with low expections and they blew me away.  Too bad for them because now I may be back.  Good fresh well made cheesesteak.  I wish it was bigger.  They are known for their wings.
__label__4	"Been to Cuba libre a few times
Night life and for lunch
Nightlife is pretty hot and usually a great crowd of 30 to 40's range.
Lunch was very nice like the outdoor seating and Latin cuisine.
Classy restaurant but has a very small dance floor for nightlife"
__label__4	Good selection of craft beers, check. Reasonably priced cocktails, check. Attentive wait staff, check. Excellent small room for live music, most def! The sound here is excellent and the room is intimate. Whenever I see that there is a band playing here I get really stoked. Been here a few times now and I cannot wait to my next show. Check it out.
__label__4	"3.5 stars

I feel like this is a nice space for drinks, but unfortunately I came here as a brunch spot, so can only review it as such. Food was fine but selections were limited - but my scrambled eggs were delicious. The hash was too fried imo. The duck Benedict actually had surprisingly delicious pieces of duck. It was also completely empty at brunch making it very easy to walk in and grab seats for a large group, which is always a plus for brunch."
__label__4	This place is a New Orleans institution, but I have to admit that this year's meal was not as good as past meals.  Don't get me wrong, it was good.  It just wasn't as delicious as I remember. Everything was tasty, but very salty.  Even the salad dressing was a bit over-salted.  Our waitress was super friendly and knowledgeable, and the service was on point.  Still an institution, but hopefully they find their way back to the level of delicious it one was.
__label__4	Here's another excellent stop for a good micro brewery in Reno. They just rolled out swing shift ipa and it is excellent. All their beer is canned or available in growlers. So come down and give pigeon head a try.
__label__4	I love this place.  It is unique and we need more places like this in Center City / Philadelphia.  Small and cozy place is always packed in the cold winter months, although I noticed that in those months it is dominated by students studying...  Carbs, sweets, and caffeine Heaven.
__label__4	Great gift shop on Metairie Road-great assortment of local, Great door hangers and novelty items.
__label__4	This restaurant is really good. I had the special, a piece of chicken with mac and cheese and collard greens. The mac and cheese was almost as good as my grandma's and different than the mac and cheese my sweetie was served. They had two different ones! The collard greens were outstanding as well. Sweetie had some kind of giant hot dog thing. It was big and served strangely. I was surprised when Sweetie suggested a restaurant attached to a museum, but it was one of the best we had in NOLA. Swank cocktails, too!
__label__4	I really like their points card. Other than that everything is kind of mediocre. The pumps are full quite often and you have to sit and wait even though they have quite a few pumps. The customer service is usually pretty good.  Every once in a while you get someone who hates their job, but other than that, they're pretty friendly.
__label__4	I love Rita's Italian ice. I prefer the Seminole location but that one is far. The customer service here is not that great.
__label__4	So fun. It's classy, drinks were good and music was fun too. Their ratchet section wasn't ratchet enough so that's why it doesn't get 5 stars. But it was a fun time
__label__4	Order the nachos, and add Barbacoa. Trust me.
__label__4	"Great place to get your coffee or tea drank on after visiting the nearby Magic House.  

Easy parking, large outside patio space with fountain, and generally good coffee drinks.  I get mine with almond milk so perhaps that's why it was a bit, um, dank... but it's still coffee that's better than most establishments around. It's no Blueprint though."
__label__4	Another wonderful small business in the Jenkintown area. Great seasonal items. I absolutely love the apple cinnamon raisin cream cheese. Their hummus is also great. Quiet atmosphere. I find myself hanging out here for breakfast and doing homework if I have time.
__label__4	"Cool little spot during a recent pub/brew hop.  Good selection, good vibes.  Very cool Star Wars artwork in the entrance ara.

There is an area out back for some games and fresh air (even though it's always hot out).  I found their selection of beers to be a bit wider than some of the other breweries.  A few ciders available for those that partake in such.

Would definitely come back again."
__label__4	Stopped in before ice cream and grabbed a couple of slices. Chose the Margherita pizza and was pleasantly surprised. Great crisp, good ratios of mozzarella and tasty sauce, and a little basil and EVOO to top it off (Chefs kiss). I will definitely be back.
__label__4	"Our experience at Brazikat for Father's day was fantastic.  We had the meat and seafood feast (which was reduced in price for Father's day).  The food was very good; it's not quite 5 star material, but I'd certainly be happy to take any of my friends and family there.

Honestly, though, the service was amazing.  The guys there were really, really great.  From Sam on down through literally every person we interacted with.  This really clinched it as a place we'll return to often."
__label__4	Decent place to grab a few beers, my only complaint is that the beer garden is split with the restaurant next door which makes it soooo confusing.
__label__4	I got the grilled chicken salad , I wouldn't say the portion was worth 15 dollars but it was good . I had a bit of my friends chicken sandwich topped with coleslaw and it was amazing
__label__4	First time there, today for lunch on a whim. Surprised and delighted. Had primarily appetizers which we shared. The corn was unusual and delicious. The mini tacos extremely tasty, the fried plantains absolutely delicious, and the guacamole with plantain chips amongst the best I've ever had. Will definitely be back, bring friends, and will get a full meal.
__label__4	Clean , quiet and priced appropriately. Food is authentic cuban and menu is short and sweet. Waiter was very nice
__label__4	"I had the Sweet Tea Pork Chops - Wood-Grilled Bone-in Pork Chop
with Tangy Peaches.  It was very tender with an unusual salt like crust.  On first bites you could taste the salt yet it was not over powering.  Staff is friendly and the place is a bit noisy.  There is a lower small stage where live music is played.  There is a nice bar with all drinks available.  The prices are high but in line with the other restaurants in the Gaylord."
__label__4	A solid go-to! Great beer, great food and you never have to wait for a table. Sold.
__label__4	We had a great time. Tons of acres of apples. Huge variety. Nice little country store. My only complaint is they had no apple dumplings :( I considered reporting my girlfriend to the autorities. She ate an apple out there while we were picking. I told her it was against state law. Quick legal question, can I get in trouble for aiding a felon?
__label__4	I get better treatment here than my normal doc.  Have had two different docs here.  A woman doctor I saw today was extremely kind and caring also.  Wish I could have her as my regular doc.
__label__4	We went for happy hour. Small plates were half price. Calamari and spring rolls were delicious. I had the amber ale and my husband had red cream stout, both were great. Service was lacking.
__label__4	"Super friendly peeps who deliver delicious, quality Mexican fare at a great price.  Love that they have Horchata, but wish they had Tres Leches cake. 

They are even open on Sundays, which in this sleepy area seems to be an anomaly.  

The spicy pork tamales will make you slap your abuelita."
__label__4	"Not-so-good:
Hot pickles are rarely available as part of buffet
Service is a bit slow and somewhat intruding at times

Good:
Best Indian buffet in Philly (the Chana Masala is terrific!)
Seating always available
10% student discount!"
__label__4	This is one of the better casino buffets. lots of cuisines to choose from and the food is really good ! Dessert case is very amazing too.
__label__4	Cute little place! Loved the atmosphere. Can sit inside at a high top table or outside on the patio. The turkey and brie donut hole sliders were a reason in itself to go back! Nachos were delicious and desserts were fantastic. Highly recommend the butterfinger cake!
__label__4	Service was good food was good.  Lasagna was a little too cheesy.  Overall good experience.
__label__4	I have been here twice and have had wonderful food both times. The calamari is the best I've had anywhere. It was deliciously fresh and tender. The eggplant Parmesan was amazing as was the Land and Sea dish with the lemon butter sauce.
__label__4	I did not know this place existed in the Reading Terminal. We head over to this place for lunch and many of us, my co-workers and myself found ourselves here the first time. I had their Wedge Salad and it was really good. Too bad the Happy Hours only lasted to 6 pm otherwise it will be a great Happy Hour hangout for us!
__label__4	"A lot of people wrote about this place so my review will be short and sweet:

Food: what sets them apart from the rest of the bunch in my opinion is the dishes with chicken breast, theirs is grilled whole and chopped in front of you, tastes a-mazing!

Place: That's where it looses the one star, it's small, and rather expensive for the type of food and number of restaurants with similar cuisine around."
__label__4	Went here for happyhour and it's a great spot for it.  The app's/bar menu is very good, the food was excellent.  The bartender was also excellent and they have an impressive open bar area that holds a lot of people as well as drink selection.  I haven't had a full dinner but I'm going back during restaurant week for sure, everything so far has been excellent.
__label__4	My husband and I go here quite often. The food is inexpensive, the atmosphere quite casual. It used to be that you would order your food at the counter and sit down, they would bring it out to you. Now they seat you and you have a waiter. They have a great, cheap lunch special seven days a week. This is my favorite place to go on a lazy Sunday afternoon!
__label__4	Normally I am pretty happy with the pizza and other items I order from Tornetta's which is why I've given four stars. Today however, the pizza was delivered and looked like it was not kept flat during the trip. A lot of the cheese had oozed to one side. When you're paying 2.50 for delivery plus tip, you'd expect better service than that.
__label__4	Great service! We went on a Friday night. There was no wait and live music playing in the background. We shared the fried pickles, which were lightly fried and delicious. The nashville hot chicken was pretty good. We got the brownie for dessert. It isn't served warm, but it still tasted  good.
__label__4	Really good food not too pricey. The food always tastes good to me. I like this restaurant!
__label__4	Delicious! Has outdoor seating through the back in addition to the front tables. Bigger on the inside than it appears from outside. Lots of varying tacos and a long list of tequila options! We had the Mahi Mahi tacos and the special - chorizo tacos. We also had the nachos as recommended by the server without brisket which was PLENTY! They were overflowing... highly recommend
__label__4	We order from here practically every week.  Absolutely love the people and the place. It's to the point where I just have to ask for my usual and they know exactly what to make.  Their General Tso chicken and Won ton soup are really good.  It's definitely my preferred place to get Chinese takeout.  I cannot say everything is good, simply because I haven't tried everything, but from what we have ordered, my family has loved it.
__label__4	The calzone was just okay. Filling was limited but the wedge salad was delicious. Our server was very knowledgable and let us know the pizza sauce had cheese in it for my dairy free daughter. The pizza is very good as well.
__label__4	"Surprised by the quality of the sandwiches since I never hear anyone from my circles in town talking about Grove Deli. But I guess I shouldn't be since they have been around for 40 years! A little hard to access since you can't get in via Lockwood. 

But we really liked our sandwiches: I had the Club sandwich and it had a substantial amount of turkey and ham on it, and it tasted great. My wife had the hot turkey and ham on French bread - also delicious. 

We will be back to try more!"
__label__4	I love to come here for happy hour. They have great food and fun drinks. The decor inside is awesome, and the staff has always been very nice
__label__4	"I wish I could give this location 5 stars, but today I did not have the full Chick Fil A ""experience"". I am new to the app and Noelle at the drive thru was very rude to me when I was asking questions about the app (sighing, eye rolling). Needless to say, I got ""McDonalds"" service at Chick Fil A today. Their food is amazing and the other staff was polite. Clean location. Would have had 5 stars if not for the poor customer service at the drive thru."
__label__4	"Good vibe. Good experience. Solid food.

Had the ribs to start - were excellent. Really unique and interesting.

I had the Pozole ramen (which seemed to be inspired by mexican flavors). It was really good. Strong unique flavors in the broth. Different textures. The noodles were fantastic. The place is legit."
__label__4	Good experience overall. Not usually a big OG guy but for whatever reason I've had very good experiences there. From the bangin food to the nice polite crew, I left a satisfied customer.
__label__4	My second time dining in and the food was better. Service was great pre usual. Great social distancing practices.
__label__4	My sandwich was quite good and the cole slaw (which is sort of a test for any sandwich place) was also very nice. Portion size was ok and overall the meal was a good value. Their product is very fresh and I suspect a lot of local return customers. The location is not in a high traffic area and there is little or no foot traffic - so to get here you have to drive.
__label__4	Great place for a worldly experience.  A couple of notes.  Place is small and busy for lunch buffet. Plan accordingly. The lamb and goat were very flavorful. The tandoori chicken on our visit was a little overlooked.  The Nann was the plain type. Hot and perfect for scooping up sauce and meat. I would have preferred the Garlic, but not a big deal.  Overalll. Great place. It's not a secret any more so make sure you are comfortable with right seating and packed dinning room.
__label__4	I recently dined at Morton's and I was a little disappointed.  I brought 4 people with me and I bragged how Morton's presents the meats at the table, which is not done any more.  One of my guests ordered a butterflied filet mignon med well and it came not butterfly and med rare.  They took it back and butterflied it and of course all the juices ran out and it was very dry and tough.  She did not want to make a big fuss so she ate it. Our steaks were good but a little disappointed.
__label__4	"Good food. Love Chicken lollipop, Chicken Sukkha, Kerala Parantha. 

South Indian is no doubt very good. 

The lunch buffet is good. The only problem is the long queues, small plates and slow service however they are getting better day by day at handling the crowd.

If you have time then certainly try it. The variety and quality of food is worth waiting"
__label__4	My husband and I stopped in here when we first moved to town and had a craving for a good diner breakfast.  This place definitely met that craving. The service was good, and exceptionally fast. The food was good, diner style food (nothing too fancy but it tasted exactly as I wanted it to!). We'll definitely return...the dessert counter looked mouth watering good.
__label__4	I just had a relaxing shave and a nice cut from Billy. A nice authentic barber experience for the lads. The staff is friendly and welcoming. The space is comfortable and they offer coffee or tea to make you feel at home. Recommended.
__label__4	"Great place to study. It is spacious with a lot of tables. Free WiFi. Background music can be kind of loud in certain areas of the cafe. I like that they are open till later compared to the cafes nearby. 

Coffee is good but service could be better. I'm a big fan of their coffee beans - my personal favorite is the Southern Toasted Pecan. They also have the a wide range of cold brew flavors. 

Tip: if you use the Saxby's app to pay, you get $2 off every $20 spent."
__label__4	We love this place.  Food is ok, but otherwise very enjoyable.
__label__4	"A friend suggested this place and I really enjoyed it! I got the burger with bacon and the egg (for the first time) and it was delicious! I got the ""jenny from the block"" cocktail which I also loved! Service was great and the staff really took care of us! The only downside for me was price, pretty pricey for me. But otherwise good atmosphere and I loved the back patio"
__label__4	I went here for a girls day with my mom and sister..the place is so cute and comfy. Great customer service and I love that they use epicuren products. Most relaxing massage I've ever had!
__label__4	I've been coming on and off to this location since it opened. Pizza and sandwiches are always good, but you can tell there on autopilot.  Not a bad thing but no real effort goes into the pizza or the service. Meatball sandwich had small meatballs , looks like the ones I buy at Sams club.
__label__4	I cannot believe I'm giving this place four stars but it was the highlight of my dining experiences in Tucson. The chicken fingers were tasty and breaded in a fun crunchy manner. The waitress was also very friendly and helpful. Thanks for making your restaurant better than most in Tucson.
__label__4	A great place to get something a little different.  The pretzels are hot and fresh, and the choices are varied. The one in Oldsmar is bigger than the New port Richey store, but the food is excellent, and the people were pleasant and helpful. This is a place I will certainly be coming back to.
__label__4	When Chapel invites bands to play, the place is rocking. The front porch area is a fantastic place to listen to live music. Great cocktails, and for the most part chill people.
__label__4	I was at ELT in April, Jason Cline did a beautiful heart for my MOM and Henry Rhodes did two beautiful custom designs on my forearms. Totally professional, VERY clean, quick and efficient. Going back in August to fill in the color. Highly recommended...
__label__4	"My girlfriend and I enjoyed breakfast sandwiches, and were quite satisfied with the food, and the quality of service.

I would recommend the Sweet Henry for a warmly comforting morning treat. Their fruit cup is served as sort of a parfait, dashed with yogurt and lavender honey to perk up their natural flavors.

The interior is decorated in a classy, relaxed style, particularly suitable for an intimate date."
__label__4	Great atmosphere. A nice selection of cigars with the chance to sit and smoke. The only drawback is the cosst of mixed drinks. all in all, nice place for cigars.
__label__4	The only reason I gave this place a 4 star is because I'm a thick burger kind of guy. Patties were too flat for my liking. Also, fries portions were small.
__label__4	I recently went to this restaurant and the food and service was good. I rarely go to Cracker Barrel because it's not my typical breakfast place but after giving it a chance I was pretty surprised by how good all the food was. It was flavorful and didn't taste generic at all and I was pretty happy about the overall experience.
__label__4	"I have to say I was skeptical and anxious after reading all of the other reviews. Although it's pretty expensive they did call me and update me like they said they would and everyone was friendly and easy to talk to. They fixed up my pupper and were honest about their procedures and I appreciate it a lot. Thank you VCA. 
(They even made a cute smiley face to his bandage)"
__label__4	Brought my boys and the neighbor boy over the weekend for some yummy yogurt.  The place was uber clean... like super clean.  I kept apologizing as the girl literally fixed every spoon in the candy bins each time the boys took a scoop.  It was borderline annoying yet kind of funny.  that being said- it was a good experience and they loved the variety available!
__label__4	Nice atmosphere, good food and good service. I gave 4 stars simply because I'm picky and I have other spots that I feel make better sushi. My husband gives it a 5 star
__label__4	Great steakhouse the food matched the photos nice bar great drinks mixed crowd glad I chose this place
__label__4	"It was a good first visit! I thought the drinks we ordered were exactly what we had anticipated. I was looking for more coffee based blended drinks but unfortunately they did not have much choices but they did have the ability to add a shot of espresso to them. I did add coffee to the KitKat drink that I ordered and it was delicious. 

The service was okay but the staff was friendly. We were able to order and they told us we could wait in the car for our drinks. It's worth a try definitely!"
__label__4	Can't go to New Orleans without hitting Acme...chargrilled oyster pleaseeeeee!
__label__4	"I am a regular customer here and love it. The salon itself is well decorated and very relaxing. Alex does all of my fills and he is amazing, my nails are perfect every time. He is the owner and always greets every customers hello and goodbye and thanks everyone. He speaks perfect english so no language barrier. He really cares for his business and watches over everything. If you have any questions about your experience, talk to Alex and he will make sure you are happy before you leave. 
I get pedis once in a while with anyone else on staff and they do a nice job."
__label__4	Great atmosphere! We were seated quickly and the service was fast and friendly. The menu was small but had a great selection of appetizers and entrees both vegetarian and non vegetarian. Creative and yummy dishes! The prices were very reasonable. Definitely a great spot to grab a drink with friends or go out to dinner.
__label__4	Great local spot for craft cocktails. Bartenders are friendly and really put effort into making the drinks. The drinks are on the pricier side but are very strong. Super cozy vibes and decor. The interior smells heavily of cigarette smoke which is a negative for me. The outside patio is much better and has heaters when it's chilly. Great spot to catch up with friends or for a date night.
__label__4	"The place was pretty cool looking and clean.

The staff was friendly.

I ordered spinnin on the trompo chicken tacos to go.
The order was ready fast.
The tacos were pretty small.
The price was 13.00.
The tacos were delicious.

Not too great for lunch unless you're willing to splurge."
__label__4	Gave me and Mom more than enough to fill our belly. Usually I pick the spicy food, but the thin slices beef was to fast to cook.  Dumping was fry, crispy. I like how they got the sauce not to spicy n not to salty.  Usually I got to get a box to bring home because it was too much. But at least my mom don't have to cook.
__label__4	This is one of the best seafood restaurants we've been to in New Orleans. A relaxed atmosphere, good food, and average pricing. Seating area is a bit small and dated...but you're going for the food.
__label__4	Met with a few of my coworkers from previous company for brunch. Everyone liked it. The patio seating is excellent and they brought over a small table so that give could fit well. I ordered their quiche and Kyoto iced coffee. Well the latter is too strong for my taste and having the 12 oz serving didn't help. The quiche was par excellence. We spent almost 2 hours there and didn't face many interruptions. The water ran out on the table but was not refilled. That apart everyone enjoyed their food a lot and will return.
__label__4	This was my first official Philly cheesesteak experience. The place is small, we were lucky to grab seats as the line is consistently long.  The steak was tasty. I had it with American cheese, onions and peppers. My boyfriend opted without cheese. I'm not sure if it left me wanting more but it was very filling.
__label__4	"I've been here a couple times and enjoyed it both times. We ordered the quesadillas and the Kennett Square pizza and they were both delicious. The beer selection is great (try the Oatmeal Stout) and the prices are reasonable. Free popcorn at the bar is a nice tough. All in all, not a bad place, even with all the choices in Manayunk. The canal walk behind it is nice, too.

Special Note: Outdoor seating when weather permits."
__label__4	This place has improved soooo much. The food was really yummy and authentic. They didn't have a couple of the wines on the menu, and weren't overly helpful and suggesting alternatives. Definitely worth a try, book early because it's popular with locals!
__label__4	Time after time, take out is what gets me thru the day. And I dont spend my calories frivolously. Snagged a breakfast sandwhich and it was fresh, hot and ready to be devoured. I asked the officer on lunch if this place was popular. And his response was that it is always busy and never a bad meal. There's a compliment worth quoting.
__label__4	The Po boy sandwiches were delicious. Gotta try the seared shrimp. Our favorite! Super affordable.
__label__4	This place is so yummy! I cant believe I am an Indy native and Ive missed out on this place for so long. I love pulled pork and they didn't disappoint. The fried biscuits were a nice treat too. If you are ever in Indy and you like good BBQ, I definitely recommend Squealers. This place definitely competes with the best of BBQ in Kansas and Missouri.
__label__4	Reasonably priced, excellent food and service, vegetarians - highly recommend to try as many different dishes.
__label__4	"Had the Lox Special and a nitro coffee.

Lox special was good: tons of salmon, crisp onion, etc. but I don't think it was $10-good. The bagels are decently priced, but their specials are more of a 'once in a while' item."
__label__4	"Great place to pick up authentic seasoned meats.  We got Carne Asada.  $8.99 a pound. Good flavor.  Meat counter guys were fast and friendly. 
Picked up some delicious guacamole on the way out. 
Great authentic favors and items for this that don't know how to do it ourselves. Hehhe.   Great market too.   Anything from quick fix eats to bar soap.  Just an all around real deal mom and pop market."
__label__4	Loved the  spring rolls! Would def go back for more of them! My boyfriend had the crab Rangoon but said it was a bit over cooked and dry. He liked the potstickers. The banh mi had delicious pork and vegetables but the bread was too flaky and dry. Maybe I needed more sauce? But theses were allll appetizers! And all under $7. Which was great because we treated it as a meal. They had cool parasols hanging from the ceiling and the bathroom was clean!
__label__4	I've always like the variety of the menu at chilis and this location just was renovated and looks great. The bar area is small and normally crowed, but service is always pretty quick.  Chilis has some of the best chips and salsa around!
__label__4	Who can pass up a happy hour!  Sit at the bar, grab a seat where everyone knows your name!  Great eats! Friendly staff. And TVs so I can watch the sixers and the phillies!  Though it there are a few yankees fans here! I will give them a pass as it is a friendly place!! .
__label__4	I had a great experience and loved the customer service.  My car took a week longer than initially promised.  But the rental was fine and I wasn't in a hurry.  Loved the lobby and the coffee.  I would recommend to everyone.
__label__4	Me and my mom have been coming here since they opened and we love the food service etc., and will continue to do so. The only thing that made our experience less enjoyable was that the hostess was coughing and carrying on while we were being seated and not covering her mouth as well as saying things out loud that don't need to be heard from customers. Other than that, love this place :-)
__label__4	Great beach restaurant......we had a pound of shrimp which were very good.... But the dish that took it over the top for us was the Creole Shrimp N' Grits or as I like to call it the Southern Budda Bowl! You know it's gotta be a great place when you see so many locals hanging out there!
__label__4	"i like to treat myself with a pedicure every now and then and lacquer lounge will likely be my new go-to.

it's not a super large salon, but it's bright and clean and i love the fluffy pillows they have at the pedicure seating area. it's one long couch that you sit on, which is a little different from your usual pedicure chair. the technicians are very pleasant and they did a great job on my toes - which have been chip free for quite a while (more than 2 weeks!).

definitely make an appointment before you go!"
__label__4	"Oh hell yes. 

My friend and I  took a cupcake adventure on a whim this afternoon, making a journey just for these gourmet yum yums to brighten our day.

No less than four really nice people waited eagerly to take mine and my friend's order.

My Birthday Surprise cupcake had a heaping swirl of bubblegum pink frosting with rainbow sprinkes. It was so good, so sweet, I actually couldn't finish it. I really really wanted to.  I think if I was younger I could have."
__label__4	"If you need to dump some stuff, this place works well. There are separate entrances for normal stuff (although metal must be separated) and hazardous material. 

If you bring a trailer, bring your backing up skills since it's required to unload."
__label__4	"To me Main event provides top notch excitement for all ages. My son is 12. He had a great time walking the ceiling and doing laser tag. 

I enjoyed watching and was pleased at how clean it was throughout. The bowling alley is very upscale and offers a little privacy. Prices were surprisingly reasonable and they had a nice area for birthdays & events. 

Great place for all ages and definitely awesomeness for families. Lastly, you can enjoy endless shopping & great restaurants/eateries in this area."
__label__4	Went to Grand Opening, was very pleased with Prompt,friendly customer service we received while seated in the bar area. The bartender made sure our drinks were always refilled, and was very knowledgeable about the menu items. The food was very good! We will be back!!
__label__4	"And we're back Joo Joo! I think or heard they got new management because service is no longer a weak point here! The food is definitely better and it looks different inside. 

We've been here twice now recently, and both times the food has been good; lots of good side dishes and the food that came out has been good!

We'll be back"
__label__4	Great selection and great service, staff i encountered were very helpful with two separate trips i made.
__label__4	It is a big airport and the workers were so very helpful. They got me it the next terminal I needed to be at. If you ask they are very good to help you. Everyone had masks on.  There were a lot of food places open and it looked great.  Unfortunately I don't have enough time to try the food. I  just needed to make my connection.
__label__4	Great menu.  Out of some menu items several times.  Service is always friendly but not efficient.
__label__4	"This place is the greatest!
Expect great sushi, service, and atmosphere!
I love it here, I go to sushi rose allot and the employees recognize me and my boyfriend when ever we come in. The only reason why I would give them a 4 is because the price has been very high compared to our usually visit and sushis already expensive as it is. Otherwise this place made me never want to eat anywhere else. I can't eat sushi anywhere with out comparing to sushi roses and that has to say something. No other place can make sushi to even close as good."
__label__4	Great food, service, portions, and prices! We had the Vegetarian spring rolls, Panang chicken curry and a fried rice dish with pineapple, shrimp, pork and chicken. I would definitely recommend this for a casual evening out and would also try their sushi next time.
__label__4	I love this place--sit in the courtyard and try a bloody! Been there a few times in the rain, and while we were getting wet, it was still worth sitting outside.  Also, supposedly their pimms cups are great, but i'm not a huge fan of the drink in general, so cant say, but good bloodies and nice history (napoleon was supposed to go hide out there, or so they say)
__label__4	Now that they have live music back on Fridays and Saturdays it makes the night even more incredible. I saw Jeff Hendrick play last night and was wowed, he is back there tonight.
__label__4	The apple butter BBQ sauce on the baby back ribs + their special cornbread was stellar! The cheesecake was frozen all the way through, but the waitress was super nice and replaced it immediately. Cool, casual place. Kid friendly too:)
__label__4	I've eaten lunch here several times with co-workers and we always have a pleasant experience.  The last 2 times I've been there I've ordered the Avocado Toast.  This is not something I would typically order when I'm out but I Love this meal.  The avocado is fresh and super tasty- it's loaded on their toasted with a side of basted eggs.  It's filling but not heavy and perfect for lunch!
__label__4	"I think everyone would give this place five stars if the prices weren't a bit steep for what it technically is - frozen flavored dairy products. But hey, if you fill up your punch card like I do, you get your 11th popsicle for free :)

And seriously, they're probably the best popsicles I've ever had! My favorite flavors are the green tea mochi and the earl grey by far. On top of that, it's just an adorable store with a pleasant colorful vibe to make your sunny summers that much happier!"
__label__4	"Fantastic pizza and definitely reasonable for a ""gourmet pizza"" place. 

Had a chopped salad which was delicious and large enough for my wife and I to share. We were convinced that the pizzas would be small and not filling so we ordered 2. The Margarita Pizza and Hamaker's Corner were both great and we ended up taking the equivalent of 1 home. 

2 pizza's + 1 salad + 1 beer + 1 wine = 65 after tip so not ridiculous for the quality of food."
__label__4	"Definitely a fan of our latest Mexican restaurant in town...  honestly, when we saw that we were getting yet another one (if I'm counting right, I think we are up to 13 now), I was not excited at all. But one visit changed my mind.

The salsa alone was worth the visit - Really outstanding! The couple of menu items we tried were good as well, and the service was fast and friendly. We will definitely be back to try again"
__label__4	Great food. Fun night out with live band, random singing waiters, buffet style food, but really tasty. Dancing at night.
__label__4	Perfect deck for spring and summer! The menu was recently redone and it has definitely stepped up its game! Decent beer list and a few wines too! I had a great meal here. Friendly service that made you feel welcome.
__label__4	This is a pretty little course. You can see they have put some money and effort into keeping it nice.  Lots of water in play throughout the course but especially on the front nine.  It is very short.  Even the par 4s and 5s are reachable in less than a couple of big shots.  I wish the sand traps sent as hard packed as concrete - that was a real pain and that's why it doesn't get 5 stars.
__label__4	"50 calories per serving and it's delicious!  

After an enjoyable dinner across the street at Anthony's, we ventured over to D'Lites for a snack.  Their flavors change daily, which is very exciting!  Also on Monday's it's double punch day!  Give it a try - pretty sure you'll be back for more!  :)"
__label__4	Glad I stopped. Great service, nice manicure, kind staff. I had a shellac manicure and was pleased
__label__4	Stopped by for lunch. Working on the West Bank in New Orleans. It seems a bit out-of-the-way. But well worth the drive. The pizzas were excellent. The place was clean. The staff was excellent. Highly rated.
__label__4	Food, Ambiance, Location is all amazing! I really liked this place! The only issue I had was the portions however the portions align with the price of the items so I completely understand their thought process around that! I would definitely return back but I'm definitely going to order more than just pasta! Great place to visit!
__label__4	Super great pizza, not best, but a G.O.A.T. I went in there, the first time, and got the Jane and this other brussel sprout joint. I don't like the brussel thing at all, it tasted dried out and flavorless, but somehow still okay. The Jane, was BEAUTIFULLY good.
__label__4	"Great selection of frozen yogurt. I love how they have Asian flavors like Taro. I prefer this place over the ice cream shops on University.

The only drawback is the parking lot: its very small."
__label__4	Best nachos on the block! Sober, drunk or blackout id suggest getting you some nachos from here.
__label__4	I miss the Spring House location! That was the first Craft Beer bar before the word Craft became synonymous with beer.
__label__4	SHake shack is good for what it is - an affordable but hearty burger joint. I usually just get a cheeseburger which always hits the spot.  Milkshakes at good too, but they will run you $5 - a little more than I'm usually looking to spend.  Overall, though, the quality of the burgers is what keeps me coming back
__label__4	"Lunch date with the hubby.  I ordered the Crab cake sandwich. The Crab cake was full of large chunks of Crab and hardly any filler. I really liked the lemon aioli with it and it was served with Arugula and a fresh roll.  The home made chips tasted a bit too oily, but I ate half of them and enjoyed the flavor, otherwise.  My husband got the ""Build your own..."" Burger and fries.
I enjoyed my Arnold Palmer drink from the bar."
__label__4	This is a cozy, friendly byob with solid, good food.  I'm a fan of the pomodoro pizza (flavorful with a chewy, crispy crust and plenty of prosciutto) and the chicken siciliano (madeira, prosciotto, provolone - get it with the tortellini).  The rolls are better than Bertucci's with a soft interior, fantastic crust, and garlic.  There is ALWAYS a wait during dinner hours but we have called in an order for takeout numerous times.  The food is just as good.
__label__4	"Best smoked sausages i've found so far in edmonton. I've become addicted to their german sausage and their sweet and spicy pepperoni  .
Big selection of smoked meats. 
Very fresh and moist inside with a wonderful smell of smoke.
Small restaurant area where you can eat soup and sandwich or hot selections they sell.
Near the end of the week they have great pulled pork sandwiches.
Small dried food deli area. 
Staff is friendly"
__label__4	I've never eaten at Szechuan Hill but have been getting takeout there for years. They are always very friendly and quick and the food is fresh. Szechuan Hill is always consistent and I have never had a problem! They are a great spot for basic Chinese takeout.
__label__4	4.5 stars! Found this place on Yelp when we were visiting Tampa. Just wanted something light so we ordered some soup. Our soup came with side dishes and rice. Side dishes were simple but delicious. Both Soon doo boo ji gae (seafood spicy soft tofu soup) and Gam Ji tang (pork bone soup) were really good. Very reasonable place to get authentic Korean food.
__label__4	Very good food that is scratch prepared. Always friendly service and the portions are generous without being excessive.
__label__4	Great food, service is a little slow but worth the wait. Bottomless mimosas are the best here!
__label__4	House of Stella is a refreshing breath of air for twenty-something shoppers in the Franklin/Brentwood area. This NastyGal inspired boutique offers several amazing brands that can be hard to find locally (HolyG, Voluspa, Fred Flare, Bluebird) and I believe is one of only two places to find Jeffrey Campbell shoes.  I recommend popping by this little gem to enjoy the scenery and shop the lot without breaking your buck!
__label__4	Wow - would give 4.5 stars if I could. This place was great. Staff was friendly and attentive, drinks were way cool and meal was excellent! Started with mussels which were super tasty but a bit too salty. The Brussel sprouts were awesome. Octopus app was perfectly done. The burger was phenomenal and I loved the idea of my child staple lebanon bologna being a part of that great taste. Finished up with half brownie/half chocolate chip cookie on a hot black skillet with scoop of vanilla ice cream on top - WOW
__label__4	"Very pretty salon.  The predicure chairs are a little difficult to get in and out of and I am 5'7"".  Someone shorter would need help.  The employees are polite.  A vast selection of polish.  Both my manicure and pedicure were well done and lasted longer than usual.  My one complaint - why do they dump the dry cuticle skin they have cut from my toes, wash their used tools, back into the water while my feet are still in there - gross !"
__label__4	Don't get it twisted this bike shop is dope super polite & super helpful. They're not snobby you just gotta speak up and be clear with what you want. They replaced handlebars for me and gave me great advice on maintenance. I've been to bike shops all over the country and I can understand it can be a bit intimidating but this place is very welcoming. 4 stars bruh.
__label__4	"A favorite watering hole of mine for almost a decade.  Cheap drinks, pool, bad karaoke, local bums, the ""Blue Mothafu*ka"" drink, and great bar food (I.e. Alligator po-Boy)"
__label__4	"As a big fan of downtown location I was excited for the opening. Finally, a patio in Carmel to hang out with adults and enjoy the evenings over drinks and adult food. Gorgeous setting, love the lights, and the atmosphere. 
I usually opt for the Sriracha Caeser, and snack burger. This visit was the Provencal but have tried several versions and no complaints on any version.  
Split the fries/onion rings as the orders are huge. My hubby can finish a regular size burger if starving but two adults can easily split with a few sides and leave full."
__label__4	Very delicious, unique food. Love savory breakfasts replete with onions and briney olives. Bacalao cakes are awesome, pierogis delicious. Yo Cuz - chicken and waffles sandwich also huge and tasty. Good value, good portions. Just wish they had more tables.
__label__4	Very awesome atmosphere for just getting started up!  I like the menu a lot, I ordered the veggie balls on a pretzel bun with white cheddar and garlic sauce.  It was absolutely delicious and priced well, but I was brought beef on accident at first.  I felt pretty sick all day from just one bite, which would make most vegetarians livid, but I wasn't too mad because I know they are a pretty new place.  They were very good about it too and I plan to return many times in the future!
__label__4	Not fine dining but much better then the usual arena fare.... Great view from all the seats in the restaurant.  Huge bar.  Friendly staff.
__label__4	"What do you want from a wine bar?  

Lots of selections by the glass:  check
Interesting light bites and small plates: check
A friendly, helpful bartender: check
An ambience that transports you out of downtown Philly: check

This place has a loooong bar, plenty of space and an interesting variety of wines.  I had a Torrontes, which you can't find everywhere.  The bartender was fun and offered a taste of the wine I selected, which I really appreciate.  I had the potato soup special, and it complimented the wine beautifully."
__label__4	Although the one just off Bourbon st was better, our po boys were really good and the gravy fries were good too, although we had a lot more meat at the other one! But still good though.
__label__4	"Great bright airy space with plenty of tables, some outlets but everyone seemed well behaved with no one fussing about low chatter. Love the pretty fresh flowers at every table and the comfy sofa where I was perched for a couple of hours.

My the iced tea was perfect...strong but not overwhelming. Since I went after work the dessert case was a bit picked over but others seem to enjoy the sweet bites they chose. 

Love the monkey art. Wish their menu was available online...but unfortunately their website (from their FB page) is no longer valid."
__label__4	I have left Whole Foods Market hopefully for good thanks to people like Dave in the cafe and Jason in produce who help me CONSISTENTLY without ever making me feel bothersome. I wish this was my closest location because almost everyone in Kimberton comes from a place of YES. May that attitude filter to ALL locations ;) Terry Brett picked up where John Mackey bailed out...please do not sell out like he did...and thank you for feeling less like a business than any other grocery store currently in existence!
__label__4	"This is an amazing place. A bar without alcohol. Open 24x7 and hidden away in an industrial park, you can only find it if someone tells you about it. 

They serve tea, tobacco and kratom but I'd be careful with that as it is mind and stomach altering. Don't overdo it. 

The ambience is very unique but everyone is friendly and there are no obnoxious drunks. 

Life is good with a 24x365 unique hangout spot."
__label__4	"Burgers are great! Have loved eating there. 

Wish their Yelp page was correct tho. Kuma's does NOT deliver, as their page indicates. You have to use a secondary service to get the food."
__label__4	Very small shop, but great idea!!  We got the box of a dozen traditional cookies and picked chocolate chunk, snickerdoodle, sugar, m&m, and oatmeal raisin.  The girls also got cookie ice cream sandwiches.  The cookies were warm and chewy, my favorite!!
__label__4	This place is pretty happening. It does get a lot of overflow from Frankford Hall but this place stands on it's own two feet. It's got a great ever changing beer selection, the food is pretty phenomenal and there's a live music scene. They're always playing some fantastic music on Vinyl, music snob or not if you've got any kind of ear for sound you're going to love it.
__label__4	"Had to try this place out since Tony C moved from Bayou over to here.  Since I'm a fan of the bayou then Cactus had to be great too.

There's food and drink specials every night.  We got a pitcher of margarita for $10, it was delicious and was plenty for 2 people.  The food was really good and I really have to go back for the lobster fajitas.  They're $8.95 on mondays!!! HELLO!!"
__label__4	"Tourist for the weekend? Trying to party, and get wild? Ybor City is one of the spots to go with restaurants, bars, and clubs this is a great spot to check out! 

Suggestions- Weekends get crazy so try and taxi into the area! 

Moose Out"
__label__4	Out of the six of us, 5 were very happy with their order. They ran into an issue when making the chocolate shake, so they just added a bunch of soft serve chocolate ice cream to it. This made it to thick to drink, but it tasted good with a spoon. Banana split was HUGE. Great spot for a treat.
__label__4	Loved this place.  Went here for breakfast two mornings with my grandparents while visiting Florida.  The service was super friendly and quick, food was very good, and the windows surrounding where we sat allowed to sit and enjoy the FL sun.  Highly recommend.
__label__4	Wife and I ate here on a Sat night. We were pleased with both the selections on the menu and the service. Yes we seated in a carnival tent which wasnt the greatest so hopefully they add on in the future. It is byob so bring a bottle of something, hang out and enjoy the tapas. We will return. Pretty casual and the vibe was fun in there.
__label__4	Again one of those neighborhood restaurants that stay consistent...even when they change the name. The proportions have gotten a bit smaller and there's been a bit of a price hike, but they have always stayed with the same good flavors. I personally love their Carnitas and Fish tacos. The chips are so good and the salsa is so yummy I could drink it by the glass.
__label__4	"Definitely worth checking out if your an out of towner. It is a nice central location in the French Quarter. The food is good, the atmosphere is probably what your looking for and they have live jazz! We went for brunch at there are a lot of options; Omelette station is the way to go, and the bread pudding and biscuits were notable. 

Overall,not your 5-star experience and a little pricey ( $30 a head) so make sure you have an appetite."
__label__4	"Pate's and porc-loving products which i discovered at the Rittenhouse Square Farmers market on Saturday AMs - but their main place is in RTM.

Pricey - but delicious.
If you don;t eat pork - try the lamb pate.  DIVINE!

Oh - and they sell pre-cooked/pre-seasoned carnitas.  Neat-o!"
__label__4	Cool local place, great selection of drinks, great service, great bartenders. And for those who are smokers, you can smoke inside.
__label__4	"Found this place on yelp. I love the easy to use online booking system. What could be better? The room is really cold. For me that makes it difficult to relax. It's a little place tucked away by The Common in Edmonton. At $60, it's comparable to the other places downtown where you can get a massage. I was able to book a massage for the next day. Got my shoulders and neck done and felt great!

The music was also really good. Acoustic guitar not the squawking birds that you hear elsewhere."
__label__4	Delicious pizza and huge slices! Really good cheese bread too. The only downside is that they never have any cheese bread ready. We always have to wait, and we always wait a lot longer than the time they give us.
__label__4	Great breakfast menu. I had the hash and eggs and my wife had egg benedict pizza.   We enjoyed the meal very much.  Friendly service as well.
__label__4	Do not forget to get the fries. Try the waffles with Nutella. The three sauces for the fries were amazing. The fig salad was also great! For a nice time people watching, sit upstairs on the porch.
__label__4	"One of my friends found this place and decided to invite a whole bunch of us. We ended up with fourteen people eating two hot pot bowls for about $80, which is really cheap even for Tucson.

I recommend getting the half and half broth, the mushroom platter, and the assorted meatballs. They serve for an army, so definitely bring a couple friends with you. The service is really nice, and the restaurant was empty except for us, so it was really quiet. 

I will be returning, probably with my sisters and parents in tow."
__label__4	We came here late night for seafood and it was really good. I had the the she crab soup, steamed mussels and one pound of the peel and eat shrimp hot. The she crab soup was rich and creamy. I couldn't eat too much but it was good. The star of the show were the mussels. They were fresh and the sauce was good. The shrimp were large and very fresh. They're cooked in a herbed type of broth. Would definitely go here again. It was a very casual beach bar with beach eats.
__label__4	Came here with my family a few weeks ago. This place is really small so if you decide to grab dinner here make sure to make reservations. For starters, we ordered a salad, roasted cauliflower and the Turkish dumplings. I personally think everything needed a bit more salt and more seasoning and I'm usually not one to have a palate for a lot of sodium. BUT I really enjoyed the pizza here! The margarita and spicy soppressata were both excellent! The crust was nice and thin with the perfect amount of chew and just perfect. Highly recommend coming here for the pizza!
__label__4	Love LOCO MOCO!!! breakfast stop after coaching mtg with the usual suspects!! Nice, bright, island themed location. This is my second time here and it definitely doesn't disappoint. I've had the loco moco both times and talked both my colleagues into trying it so no experience with the other food. I'm sure it's great though.
__label__4	We took our 2 year daughter for some play time while we were visiting Tucson. The location was a lot bigger than I expected with many different rooms for kids to learn and explore and play. It was a bit busy when we visited on a Sunday afternoon but we still had a great time. With the amount of visitors, a lot of the stations were a bit messy and I didn't see any staff cleaning up while I was there.
__label__4	In the Pat's vs. Geno's debate, I am always on the side of Pat's. Their meat is tender and the cheese whiz is melted just right and the bread is phenomenal. Perfect cheesesteak and I have yet to find a better one in Philly.
__label__4	Crab cakes are good, jambalaya is meh, fries were cold. But, Kitty was awesome!  Got us fresh fries, had a great visit, and I'd go back just to talk to her!
__label__4	"Round up from 3.5. Came here around 2pm and was told that there's no more pita. But wait, they somehow found 2 left after 10 seconds. Don't know what happened there but was able to enjoy tahini hummus with side salad and picked vegetables. Yummy and filling but was disappointed that the hummus wasn't warm like at Zahav. Reliable choice for something tasty. Hopefully the fad will be over soon and it won't sell out so quickly.

Also remember it serving alcohol as well."
__label__4	This place has the most amazing ribs that I have ever tasted.  The sweet potatoe fries are excellent and the pulled pork hit the spot (North Carolina kid so I had to have some vinegar based sauce - received per request).  If they had dessert and better brisket would have rated higher , but the ribs are a winner for sure.  Be sure to check them out if u are in St. Louis!
__label__4	Great lunch spot for jury duty. A block away. Good menu and food. Hard to believe the presentation. Almost took a pic of my stacked fries. You won't regret it.
__label__4	"I use K9 for my 18 month goldendoodle on a regular basis 
The place is immaculate and smells good and the staff is very professional.
My Chase loves it there, the only thing i would like changed is being able to see him during the day either via pictures or a web cam and i would be willing to pay for it.
We also left Chase for 4 days when we were away and he returned home happy and the only negative thing i have to say about their boarding is that there is no one on the premises after 7pm and i was told that the owners of the resort watch them on their camera from home"
__label__4	I love this place for all my fried cravings. The gumbo is inconsistent (one day it was lukewarm), but it is my favorite gumbo in New Orleans so far. The fried chicken is solid - probably some of the best I've ever had at a restaurant. Service is usually pretty good. This is the place to bring friends/family visiting New Orleans for their first time.
__label__4	This is definitely worth stopping in for a drink just to see the carousel.  Unfortunately the carousel bar was full when my boyfriend and I stopped in, but we still enjoyed the atmosphere from our chairs by the window.  Drinks were tasty, but not strong at all.
__label__4	Very nice people, friendly dogs, and over all amazing food and drinks. I think that the place is fun with games outside and in making it also fun for kids who were brought along. Would definitely recommend this as a place to eat and hang out and there drinks are amazing.
__label__4	"Good local Habachi Grill and Sushi - Like the atmosphere inside too with Bar and decor.
Would go back and perfect for B-days."
__label__4	Long story short- I tried to grow lavender from 3 different batches of seedlings and failed miserably each time. I really wanted lavender in my garden, and after searching ALL OVER the city for lavender plants, City Planter mentioned they had small herb sized plants in stock for $4. None of the big box stores had lavender plants in stock, and I was not going to try to grow a 4th batch from seed. With reasonable pricing, I visited the store and picked up two plants. I loved the layout of the store and the selection of planters as well. Will be back for sure.
__label__4	Great events at symphony on the prairie , nice learning center , but great views from the overlook room in the woodland center
__label__4	I could see myself becoming a regular at the Vollrath.  The staff is friendly, the beer is cold, and the music is about as eclectic as it gets.  I love the atmosphere and history of the place as well.  I do, however, agree with the other Yelper who suggested that they serve some kind of munchies.
__label__4	This McDonalds is so convenient and is the closest location to me. The line moves quickly and the drive-thru window employees are typically very considerate and sweet. Four stars only because they always use the folded/scrambled egg in breakfast sandwiches that are supposed to have the round egg. Kind of petty I know, but the round egg is the reason I get the Egg and Cheese McMuffin.
__label__4	There were 5 of us for dinner and the food and service was fantastic. Lumpia, steamed buns and crispy cheeks to start. Burger, shrimp and ramen for entree. The price point was great and if I lived in Indy, I would come here often. Great find!
__label__4	"Cute breakfast joint with exceptional food and great service. 

I went with the egg and lamb sausage sandwich served on a brioche bun with tomato confit, sautéed onions and feta. The egg was cooked just right and the sandwich was perfectly constructed, it held together the entire time without falling all over the plate as it had just the right amount of toppings. 

House-brewed coffee was very good, it was just the right strength. Our server was very nice and the prices are fantastic for the quality and innovativeness that you receive. If I lived here I'd be a regular."
__label__4	Don't judge a book by it's cover. The perfect you is located in what seems to be a converted apt complex and doesn't even have a sign outside to tell you where to go (besides a small one next to the door).  I was skeptical until I entered and the inside is cozy and clean. They have done a great job on the ambiance. Both people working there were very nice and the massage was lovely! I especially liked the use of heating pads and a scented eye mask. I would definitely go back again!
__label__4	"Food:
Mac and cheese: Amazing 
Fries: Ok 
Potato salad: Great
Ribs: Ok (I prefer the fall off the bone, covered in sauce type)
Brisket: Good 
Pecan Pie: AMAZING 

Service: All around great 

Probably won't be back before leaving Philly, but it was the correct choice for my Memorial Day BBQ substitution :)"
__label__4	It's mini doughnuts, what's not to love! Great combinations, I loved the snickers and peanut butter cup. The vanilla birthday cake was underwhelming. They are small enough to let you try them all! They didn't receive a full five stars because I wish they had additional coffee options (cappuccino, different milk options, etc...)
__label__4	Awesome way to start the day! Hearty breakfast served by friendly staff. Lots to choose from from the menu of breakfast classics.
__label__4	Wonderful drinks in rotation. I came here for a quick lunch with a friend. Our server was extremely helpful in recommending food and drinks.
__label__4	"Really really really good burger. Super friendly service from Tracy at the bar. The food was also really cheap. I had a burger with onion rings and it was only $8.30 put the door! That's with adding mushrooms on the burger. I came for lunch and the service was really fast. I will be coming back.

Only reason it is 4 stars instead of 5 is because you can smoke in the bar area. Not cool."
__label__4	Just finished running the 4-mile Thanksgiving run when we decided to use the coupon for buy one get one free offer from the run. Tried a Carmel Blended. It was alright albeit a bit too much sweetness and Carmel and not enough coffee taste. The vibe was cool but the normal prices are a bit steep.
__label__4	"This may be the cutest ice cream shop in Nashville. Or anywhere. The flavors are so creative and wonderful! I had the Movie Star (lemon and ginger custard) as well as the coffee/toffee ice cream flavor; sampled the rosewater, which was unique and interesting! The Movie Star was the big standout.

If you're going to go for a sugary treat, you might as well go somewhere as amazing as the Pied Piper. This is some special stuff."
__label__4	Cashier on duty was super vigilant about keeping masks on which could be viewed many ways.  Found the wine selection to be pretty limited, bit they did have a rarer Amarone della Valpolicella wine from Italy.  We eventually won the girl over at the end when my dad tipped her for keeping us COVID safe -- this location was semi #declawed on cold White Claw, but they did have plenty on the back wall.  One of the smallest BEVMO's I've ever visited.
__label__4	"It is very hard not to dry out turkey, so I was impressed when the turkey leg was juicy. The added herbs gave a great bite of flavor to the meat.
Also ordered a side of collard greens and cornbread. I wasn't a huge fan of the collard greens, but I loved the cornbread."
__label__4	"I found this place to be just fine, our server was nice and the food was really good.. I'm sure if you are going to an "" all you can eat "" sushi place you can expect a certain level of quality and this place met my expectations , I definitely will be going back"
__label__4	I've never been disappointed here.  Great farm fresh new american food in a relaxed cozy atmosphere, with mismatched furniture and lots of charm.
__label__4	Great service from our waitress! Nice gourmet thin crust. We were tempted to do a dish as well but she knew we were from Chicago and said it's great but not the same style. Thin crust was crisp wit cornmeal. Great choice.
__label__4	While on a mini-vacation we had lunch here at the recommendation of a friend who lives locally. The service was really great and the food was delicious. I ordered the King Burrito and my boyfriend got a combination plate. I was a little scared as I assumed by the name my meal would be the size of my head but happily it was a normal portion and so so good! If I'm ever back in Indy and craving Mexican I'll be sure to make another trip here!
__label__4	Neighborhood joint I've been to quite a few times. People swear by their wings, they are pretty good. Last night was the first night with outside dining since coronavirus held us hostage these past few months. Place was a bit crowded but the service was good. Me and my lady got a few beers and Cajun wings and mozzarella sticks. Both were good, beers were great! 8.1/10
__label__4	"Food was very good. Price was so-so.

I had the Tucson which was a good portion size. I like that the calories are much lower than other restaurants. Price was slightly higher than I would have liked which knocked off a star. They were also out of stuff to make fruit smoothies which was a bummer."
__label__4	"Karaoke dive bar in the Elliston Place/Vanderbilt area of Nashville.

This has been a staple I in Nashville for as long as I can remember....think Cheers in a College town. Regulars, bar tenders who know you by name, bar 
Games, food oh, and did I mention karokee and wonderful people-watching opportunities...

They have reasonable prices, adaquate seating...and did I mention Vandy students singing karaoke..."
__label__4	Service was great!! The waitress was very nice and very attentive even as it was very busy, she even gave me a sample of a drink i saw that look delicious. I ordered the hash and the million dollar bacon!! So good! The food was amazing and filling! I will be going back again. Just wish they had mimosas! But other than that great experience and food was delicious
__label__4	Great restaurant with plenty of vegan options! Love the roasted veggies
__label__4	Only have had breakfast here, but they get it right. French toast is perfectly cooked and the hash browns are homemade. A very solid place to come and get a simple well cooked breakfast. Service is good, and the wood paneling gives it a nice woodsy homey feel.
__label__4	Bring an umbrella! This beach is great, the distance from the tide to the top of the beach is shorter than on any other beach I've been on, which is different but kind of cool. There are kayak and paddle board rentals as well.
__label__4	Don't let the 'hole in the wall' storefront fool you. They have great pizza and I also love their house salad. They also deliver and it's always fast and friendly.
__label__4	Took my family to check this place out. Looking at the reviews I wanted to try everything. Be careful when heading there as you can miss it. If you don't want to look new automatically park across the street in the little lot. Now the food...so good! We had the cheese steak, chili cheeseburger, regular cheeseburger, a footlong with cheese and bacon, and chili cheese fries. Everything was GOOD...very filling so enjoy!
__label__4	"I live right next to this restaurant and it is one of my favorites in Tucson.  I would break down the rating of it like this:

Breakfast - 5 stars (amazing huevos rancheros and chorizo)
Dinner - 4 stars (great Mexican dishes but not my favorite in Tucson)
Salsa - 4 stars (just average salsa, a little on the hot side)
Tortillas - 5 stars (delicious and you get to see them being made. I often walk over here just to buy tortillas)
Seating - 5 stars (great view and cool designs on the table; plenty of room)
Service - 4 stars"
__label__4	Wonderful place!  A bit small but cozy.  Easy to talk to friends and enjoying good times.  The food is awesome!  Try the chicken pot pie - it's great.  We had that, the salmon and roast ribeye open faced sandwich.  Had cobbler for dessert and all were wonderful!  Wonderful experience with good friends.  We will be back often!
__label__4	"Classic restaurant down in the Quarter. 

We've only been there once but it was great.

Try the jazz bistro and enjoy live music while you eat. :)

And don't forget to get the Bananas Foster for dessert. 

Killer!"
__label__4	Best gumbo we found while we were in New Orleans. This was not a fancy place, just simple Poboys with fries and tots. The shrimp were deliciously cooked, and spicy just like the menu promised. Plenty of seating and a kick service.
__label__4	This place was a nice quiet place to stop in for a break from the hustle & bustle of the French Quarter.  We didn't try their beignets, but the breakfast croissant sandwiches were quite good. The gumbo was just so-so.  I particularly enjoyed the tuna fish with bacon & cheese croissant, however fattening it was.  The atmosphere is friendly & quaint, and there were small birds flying throughout the cafe picking up the stray beignet crumbs.
__label__4	Very friendly staff! They noticed we had our dog in the patio and offered to bring a bowl with water. Food tastes great and was prepared very fast!
__label__4	The food was delicious and the price decent. I thought it was way too loud however and the atmosphere and decor not all that. I would go back for the food. Brussels sprouts were ok. Calamari and dates were good. Kobe burger delic. Rice pudding so-so.
__label__4	"I LOVE this coffee shop! Very authentic New Orleans atmosphere which is to be expected from a shop that is affiliated with one of the cities oldest and most historic restaurants. Not your typical tourist-y place you would expect to find in the quarter. They also have an amazing little courtyard/patio. It's one of my favorite places to bring a book and hear  the street musicians on royal in the near distance. Very ""old"" New Orleans! Oh, great iced coffee, too!"
__label__4	Just some constructive criticism on the brisket sandwich. If I was to pay $12 for a BBQ sandwich it needs to be on point. The brisket itself was tender but it wasn't sliced or chopped but rather very large cubed pieces with some big chunks of fat hidden under the bun. I've eaten at many a BBQ joints and this was one of the few that served cubed brisket on a sandwich. Having said that, the service was quick and very polite. The building itself was cool and inviting. I'll try it again but I won't be ordering the brisket.
__label__4	Great prices! They really know how to do nails.  They just need just need to work on their customer service and it would be nice if you could schedule appointments because not everyone likes waiting. The place is very small.
__label__4	This is a good place to eat. They offer a lot of food for a very reasonable price. It is always crowed, especially during the winter months. There are always people standing outside waiting to get in. A little secret, if you call them as you are leaving, you might not need to stand on line!
__label__4	Great stop for some of the best seafood in town. The only reason that this place didn't get five stars is because it was so packed that the servers were overwhelmed and the service was quite slow. The raw oysters were great. The boiled crawfish was great and the boiled shrimp was great. The boiled shrimp was hard to peel though. My buddy got the shrimp and corn chowder. He said it was pretty amazing. I got a soft shell crab poboy and it was awesome as well!!!
__label__4	"The food here is great. It has a very European feel. They have a cool coffee bar and they have a selection of premade salads and deli foods as well as hot foods. They do a good breakfast as well. They also sell cute trinkets that would make great gifts. 

I marked off one start because I purchased some aged cheese here that was wayyyyy too aged. It was completely moldy (and it wasn't a moldy cheese)."
__label__4	"This place is pretty awesome. Why, then, am I only rating this place 4 stars?

The food? No, crepes are delicious and surprisingly large.
The drinks? No, breakfast cocktails are always a win.
The service? Nope, spot on.
The decor? Tasteful and cozy - the wife loves their coffee accompaniments.
The price? Yeah, we dropped over $300 for a group of 6 I think. Granted a lot of that was drinks while we were waiting for a table, but dear god."
__label__4	Love this place fresh sushi and full menu to choose from. Busy on weekends and have to wait for orders but worth the wait. Need more help at busy times like that. We always enjoy the freshness of everything. Hot towels are always a plus. Hidden gem in it's location I think. Most ppl don't know how good it is. Price is fair. Still amazingly fresh and great service. We are regulars here
__label__4	New to Ethiopian food?  Give it a shot. Try the meat combo if you're a carnivore. It gives you a great sampling of what the place has to offer.  You get a lot of food for a small cost. Plus, you eat with your hands here, which is fun.
__label__4	Pizza was delicious! Wish I could've gave it 4.5 stars instead. Only downside was that some of the specialty pizzas had a thicker crust then the plane pizzas. I prefer my buffalo chicken on a thinner, normal sized pie like a normal NY style pizza but still delicious nonetheless. Support your local business!
__label__4	"This store has everything you could need under one roof. It has great prices. The bakery isn't great. But its worth going just for the prices.If you see something on sale at another store and its cheaper then you can tell them what the price was and to price match it and they will.
Saveing a little money these days is a nice thing!!
There is a picture place, nail salon, glasses deparment, garden center and a tire center.
Gotta love saving time and getting things done all at one store"
__label__4	"We went here for our anniversary dinner. I had the special (butternut squash ravioli) and it was delicious! The brushetta they brought out before the meal was really good. My husband did order one meal but was brought a completely different one. He didn't alert the waiter because he doesn't like to cause issues. The meal they brought him he did enjoy. 
The bread they brought with dinner was just okay. We will definitely try it again!"
__label__4	So tasty! Great food and cold beer. Lovely little spot to meet friends or have a date night.
__label__4	This is our go-to pho place. First of all, if you haven't discovered pho yet, I suggest you give it a try. It's basically a big bowl of Vietnamese soup with your choice of meat, noodles, basil, and other seasonings. If you're looking for a cheap night out, it can't be beat. I also tried the iced drip coffee with sweetened evaporated milk while I was here. It was very strong and very good.
__label__4	"Recs: Brussel sprouts, potatoes bravo

Relatively easy to get into with a group

More stuffy than the rest of Nashville

Fair prices and good for sharing

Paella is good large takes awhile"
__label__4	Food was great. They messed up my husband's order by putting cheese on it but I ate his tacos too. Very authentic and flavorful Al Pastor Taco
__label__4	Sang Kee is our favorite restaurant in China Town. Their food is consistently excellent. The atmosphere and design of the main dining room is very nice. Three floors allows for anything from small groups to large parties. The duck is spectacular. Generally, folks split between Joe's Peking Duck house and Sang Kee as #1 - my vote is with Sang Kee.
__label__4	Picked up the Baleadas later that afternoon and they were FANTASTIC!!! The meat was seasoned and grilled to perfection. Next time I come, it'll be for dinner
__label__4	Excellent atmosphere and great food!!  Very low key.
__label__4	We had a great server.  She was very helpful and pleasant.  The menu is very large.  That always worries me.  The food came out just as advertised.  Very good taste and presentation.  The place is noisy
__label__4	My husband and I had a day off this week and stumbled upon Boca in RIVERVIEW during their happy hour. The food and drinks were really good and you can't beat the happy hour prices. We are looking forward to trying them for diner.
__label__4	First of all, St. Joseph's has a great venue around the Mass Ave area. Who wouldn't want to eat in an old church with gorgeous vaulted ceilings? I also appreciated that it was open late, as we were headed there right after a show. The food was a bit pricey but definitely worth it. I had the lamb burger and pickled veggies, and I could probably eat the pickled veggies all day without getting tired of them. St. Joseph's is a local gem.
__label__4	Great customer service! I didn't know my bra size in american and the lady took me in a fitting room and mesured me. She gave me a robe and asked me about my style and colour choice. She picked great bras.  personal experiance and top service! Only negative is that Thea did not have a ton of selection.
__label__4	"Everything I've tried here was delicious. The ""fo duck"" was so tender & delicious that I had no idea it wasn't even actual duck & it was made from tofu. The menu changes at times and a few of my favorite items have been removed, so for that I took a star away."
__label__4	Sauces are amazing, I do wish the pineapple was a tad spicier. Layout is more of a grab and go place, but everything was very trendy. Vegan + meat options. Perfect for lunch, I'd shy away for dinner.
__label__4	"I like Value Village and I usually find some pretty neat stuff. I usually come by a couple times a week to see if there is anything new brought in. However. . .

. . .As happy as I am to shop here, this particular Value Village makes me ill when I go inside. It's clean and very well organized but I start to feel nauseas and lightheaded once I'm inside. I'm not sure what is causing those symptoms but as soon as I quickly leave the store I feel better again."
__label__4	Found Marabella's by accident- just happened to walk by- and so glad that I did!  The staff was very friendly and the place was clean.  I ordered the veggie-balls traditional style.  The balls had a nice sweet flavor and the broccoli rabe was a delicious compliment.  The bread was perfectly toasted.   And the food came out in lightening speed.  Will definitely be going back.
__label__4	We use to order home delivery from Kabuki, its always good and very well done food. The rolls and the gyoza are fantastic. We love sushi and have eaten sushi all over the world and this is very good sushi for the low price!
__label__4	Went an a lark after we had heard this shop has been around since the 40's.  There was a line but staff and customers were friendly and it lends to atmosphere. Got a cuban to share with the hubby and deviled crab mini's for a football party.  Cuban was so big and meat stuffed we spilt it between 3 people and still had leftovers. Mini's were crab filled and gone in a flash! We will be back!
__label__4	We had a party of 8 visiting the area and they were able to schedule the pizza and entrees to come out very close together. Several of us thought the margarita pizza was great. We loved the house salad dressing and I had the tortellini Alfredo and thought it was excellent
__label__4	Came for the awesome food... Will come back for the sexy staff.
__label__4	"Rotisseur does chicken and they do it well.  I've walked and driven by  countless times and finally made it in.  I got to the try the chicken banh mi sandwich and the mac and cheese side.  Both were very tasty.  

The staff are friendly and the prices are very affordable.  I look forward to getting back here again and trying other things on the menu."
__label__4	So many flavors I couldn't even decide. But the free samples were yummy. We bought the cake and jalapeno ranch and they were a hit.
__label__4	Another great aquarium. All the exhibits were great. The kids loved the play area. We also went on the dolphin boat ride. The boat ride was great and lots of seats.
__label__4	This is the kind of local spot you want close to your house. Only open for breakfast and lunch, and there's not a thing on the menu that isn't really good. Brunchery is the place where everyone knows your name, and the waitresses know your order. Incredible omelettes and home fries, and lunch is just as good. They have my frequent flyer card.
__label__4	The wings (garlic-Parm) were just ok, but the Dr. Tan burger was amazing, one of the best burgers I've ever had. Looking forward to returning and trying some other items.
__label__4	Great food, good service. Beautiful indoor area and TV's for sports. Great bar with a tremendous selection of beer.
__label__4	"Very nice menu and presentation of entrees at Mistral Restaurant. Sure its expensive and I'm not sure it's worth the lofty prices but if you're looking for a high end restaurant locally this is a viable option.

The Lamb Chops entree from the specials list was beautifully done and the 4 chop portion, while somewhat small, really was just about right. Always solid."
__label__4	One of my favorites in St. Louis. Don't miss ordering the bruschetta for appetizers. All the dinner entrees are nice and offers good selection of wines.
__label__4	Love coming to place ever since I saw it on Diners, Drive-ins and dives. This time I came in specifically for the wings that I heard so much about and they definitely lived up to the hype. Although not advertised as spicy, I had to drink a good amount of water while eating them(I am a softy when it comes to spice). Wings were very tender and sauce is amazing. The waitress was also very attentive in making sure we had everything we needed. This location is easy to pass up when driving by as the location is kind of isolated but well worth the drive.
__label__4	DO NOT GET THE CRAB RANGOONS.  I've never had worse.  There is not filling and they are terribly dry.  And if you order egg rolls, make sure you ask for sauce because they apparently don't give it otherwise.  That said, the food was otherwise very good and the shrimp are huge.
__label__4	I really liked this place on my one visit there. The service was fine. I ordered chicken and vegetables in a coconut sauce and found it really satisfying. Price was only $12+ after the taxes. Granted, this review is only based on one visit so take it for what it's worth. But I intend to go back there.
__label__4	Excellent local eatery took Mom out for Mother's Day and everyone was satisfied. Gabie was performing which was enjoyable. I had chicken and steak enchiladas, mom had the bbq pork and wife had chicken Parmesan , everyone had leftovers.
__label__4	"Its a fun place to hang out, play some board games, etc. Yes, the bartenders have personalities. This is a good thing! It's a great bar for the area: a cool hangout for older college students and locals. Chill environment, cool hipsters, and a great change up to the typical bar/venue that most bars are in nola.

Only 4 stars because the Freret area has no to-go-cups and maintains a curfew. Next stop Snake and Jakes if it gets past midnight..."
__label__4	This store was understaffed on the day we came but after searching for 10 mins we were able to find Terry on the other side of the store to help us in the toy department. Terry looked busy but quickly detoured to help out. When we couldn't find an item he readily went to check in the back for us. Four stars for him!
__label__4	"- BYOR (bring your own rice). Like a few of the other Asian restaurants around Reno rice doesn't automatically come with entree. It is an up charge to get a small bowl of rice that should already be included with the entree. 

- good to great food 

- good service 

- parking could be tricky 

- fair prices"
__label__4	This is a great restaurant with something for everyone! I've been here several times over the last few years, sometimes with a group (it's a great place for a group) and never heard anyone complain. The drink menu is amazing too with a great beer and wine menu. I wouldn't suggest BJs for a date night, the big TVs by the bar can easily be a distraction for most men :-).
__label__4	The food was very good. We had chinese rice and sweet and sour chicken, it was great. There was a couple eating there and they told  us that they ordered mofongo and it was extremely good too. On the downside, the place is ugly and they dont even have ice for your drinks. I suggest you order take out
__label__4	Coffee is definitely so quality. The lattes on tap have become such a habit for me! Probably not the best place to do work, it's crowded and busy most of the time. Definitely a pit stop for like all of the city hall workers
__label__4	In terms of transportation hubs in the northeast, 30th Street Station has gotta be up there as one of the prettiest. Super high ceilings, great sculptures, relatively clean, tons of space, and well integrated with the infrastructure of the city. Definitely worth a quick Instagram. Note that if you're hopping on a cheap city-to-city bus, it'll probably stop outside a block or two away.
__label__4	Fun bar. Enjoyed the live music on the multiple levels. Great place to hang out and have a beer. Would go back again.
__label__4	My only criticism about this place is how freakin' long it tales to get your food if its busy. If you catch them on a dead night, its the best sushi you can get for the price (22.99$ all you can eat) anywhere on the Westbank.  They're pretty good at remembering you too if you're in often! Friendly smiles and what not :p
__label__4	This beautifully curated museum focuses on contemporary Southern art, with an impressive collection of local and regional artists. All mediums are represented including sculpture, pottery, paintings, drawings, photography, digital and more. There's something for everyone at this unique art museum. I LOVED the huge collection of Outsider Art, it was the highlight for me. Don't miss the huge rooftop deck with sweeping city views. A must-visit for art fans visiting New Orleans.
__label__4	Waitress was very patient as we tried to find out details on ingredients to avoid issues with my wife's food allergies. Food was decent, atmosphere was nice. We'd go again.
__label__4	While I have ate at other location this new location in Wesley Chapel is refreshing and offers a great casual atmosphere with friendly staff and a good crowd. Good is tasteful but basic. Hamburger have a great char and flavor. There is a fair selection of beers on draft and in bottles. There is outdoor and inside seating. Good place to hang out with friends or make new ones.
__label__4	Huge rooms with kitchen great happy hour with free food beer and wine
__label__4	I grew up coming here and have fond memories. Coming back as an adult I am glad it remains a great diner!
__label__4	I always walk by West Elm but typically keep walking because I am not in the market for home goods. I also had it in my head that everything at West Elm was super expensive. Today I walked in looking for a gift. While some of the things are extremely expensive, there are some very reasonable options. Additionally, there are many sales going on right now. The staff was friendly, and I ended up getting two unique wine glasses to go along with a bottle of wine I already bought for the gift. I'll definitely be back if I need another gift.
__label__4	Our first stop in Tucson. Everything was very good. I was a bit unsure of the neighborhood being new to the area but the food quickly overcame any doubts I had. Food was delicious.
__label__4	Love this place!  Food is always great and the service is always wonderful.  My favorite is the Greek chicken.  Always amazing and enough food for 2 or 3 meals!
__label__4	I enjoy their prepared foods section. Their gumbo is the closest I've had to homemade compared to any store-bought in the area. The prices for everything else is a wee too steep to make this my to-go store, but it's a great resource for hard-to-find items.
__label__4	We tried several things here..,Redfish, mustard greens, crab cakes, fried crawfish, creole, shrimp etoufee, and red beans and rice.  While it was all good, by far the stars of the meal were the mustard greens and red beans and rice.  They won't disappoint!
__label__4	"I've been to Birra quite a few times now with the wife and kids and I must say we had a great experience every time ! The waitress' are all very nice and extremely accommodating. My kid's get very restless in restaurants but not here because they bring out some pizza dough for them to play with.....Brilliant!! Now we(the adults) can enjoy our beer and food in peace! The food and beer selection were very good too!
Great spot....we'll be back!"
__label__4	"Grew up eating the Montecito one which is sadly now gone.  This is the closest approximation and seems to be same recipe, but the quality is all over the place.  The time before last I swore would never eat it again, then broke down and got it again subsequently and it was a damned masterpiece.  That last one had fresh garlic on it and I requested it well done or ""crispy"".  Anyway give it a shot.  Eat a piece in the car as you leave, you can almost hear your dad cursing at you."
__label__4	Had the three meat platter.  Brisket, ribs and sausage.  All were delicious..  I feel a bit pricey though..
__label__4	"Another Icon. 

If you are in Nashville, near Vanderbilt for a weekend, stop by for the quick and friendly service at the Pancake Pantry.  The food is served with hospitality in spades... and despite the impression of moving in a leisurely fashion, the line at the door (which is often quite long!) moves rather briskly.

Coffee with pancakes makes for a great morning treat to start the day.  Bacon, sausage, fruit flavoured syrups are all present and accounted for.

Bon Appetit!"
__label__4	Nice location, wonderful ambience and good service. Can't go wrong and the food seems fresh!
__label__4	the staff is friendly and accommodating.  everyone was attentive to me and you even get a complimentary back massage during your stay!
__label__4	If you are ever in New Orleans this is an absolute must. The beignets are wonderful and the coffee is pretty good to. Eat them there or you will have powdered sugar everywhere!
__label__4	Great tanning place! The girls who work there are super nice and helpful! They have great beds and always are offering specials and deals. The best part though? The heated versa spa tan booth. Spray tanning that doesn't turn you orange! They also have great hours! I'm a fan.
__label__4	A great home feel with friendly service and great pancakes. The sweet potato pancakes are packed with sweet potato and covered in cinnamon and powdered sugar. They are light, fluffy and cooked perfectly -- nothing worse than dense, over cooked pancakes. However, I am glad I went on a Friday morning with no line. I'm not sure I would have been as happy if I waited in the notorious long line on the weekends.
__label__4	The teriyaki wrap was sooooo good! I wish I had the recipe for that tofu!! I loved it! Wish I could eat it every single day! Would definitely recommend it to anyone who loves good food :) vegan or not!
__label__4	Great location. Perfect hotel for a business traveler. Good rates. Clean and a good staff.
__label__4	This place never disappoints! From the eggs to the burgers to the shakes to the fries ... this is where I go when I am in the mood for a guilty pleasure.
__label__4	"This place is a hidden gem in STL for breakfast/brunch. It's pretty small so probably not a good spot for large groups. I got the Barn House Slinger which was delicious, and I don't even like slingers (get it without chili). Typically it's a good welcome. They'll say things like ""welcome to the Barn"""
__label__4	Solid food. Dry rub on the ribs was fantastic. Brisket was done appropriately and mac and cheese hit home
__label__4	Had the chopped steak salad here and it was done real well with the perfect amount of dressing. What was impressive was the seared ahi salad that my cousin had, looked like a piece of art especially for the value. Just great salads at a bomb price..
__label__4	We go here 2xs/week. It doesn't get the full 5 stars bc the atmosphere is a little lacking (dark/rundown), and I can't vouch for anything but the fajitas. The service is always spectacular, the price is borderline cheap, and the portions are HUGE. They serve chips n salsa for free. Salsa has a good flavor....chips served warm-hot. I highly recommend chicken and/or beef fajitas.
__label__4	This place is completely underrated. Every time we go, we get great service.  The food comes out quick, hot, and perfect looking.  I have been there about 15 times and have not ever had a bad experience or had any mistakes made.  Also, I love the Thai iced tea.  Its a little weird at first, but once you try it, you will find yourself craving it a couple days later.
__label__4	Stopped in for a piece of cake for my birhtday, I had the black Forrest cake. It was perfect,  not too sweet and very fresh. The girls that were working helped me and wished me happy birthday. Cute place.
__label__4	Good place to see some comics. Food is good, not to pricey, and typically you walk away happy.
__label__4	"Love this place. Nice atmosphere for a casual or business lunch. I usually get a Chile Relleno special rice and beans are always good and hot. 
Free chips and salsa are always good and they refresh them for you quickly.  My kids like it too. Been there over a dozen times. Good go to place for quick clean and good Mexican food."
__label__4	My Chai tea is on point!! I added a pump of gingerbread to it this time. More than pleased. Doing the happy dance... Delicious!!
__label__4	I had the Philly cheese steak with peppers and it was really really good. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because of the price, I think they are over priced for what you get. If you don't care about the price, then it's a solid cheese steak.
__label__4	"Baru Bistro & Tapas is located on a part of Magazine that isn't overly traveled.  Free parking is available, outside seating is available (with a nice overhang that protects diners from the rain), indoor dining is charming, service is decent, food is pretty great, & prices are relatively reasonable considering the portions & quality of food.

This place is worth a re-visit."
__label__4	I've been a client of Harlow for about a year and a half and have always had a great experience. The staff is always warm and friendly and the stylist are customer focused and very talented!  I've had highlights, cuts, color and trims all done by Carly Rae and she has always made sure that I walk out satisfied and happy. It's nice when getting your roots done can be enjoyable and not a chore.
__label__4	Great soup and pork bun. Little bit pricy, but it's acceptable. I did both eat in and take out. Eat in of course better, but take out is not so bad too. It took them about 30 mins to delivery. I heated the soup up a couple mins. It was great! I'll do it again.
__label__4	Food is pretty decent here.  I go for the shrimp tacos normally. The smoothies are good here as well. I would recommend if you have any special instructions for them to call or they will most likely get ignored when ordering delivery. Staff is nice.
__label__4	"After several visits to Bittersweet, I felt it time to finally take a minute to review this gem of a coffee shop/bakery/sweet shop. The cinnamon rolls are amazing, the cupcakes are fantastic, and the coffee is great! Don't miss their packaged salted caramels & toffee. These are staples of any gift box I send to out-of-town friends and family.

The seating could be a bit more comfortable, but how much time do you really want to spend with so many sinfully, sweet temptations?"
__label__4	WingHouse is good and all but for me personally, I'll always be a Hooters girl at heart. However I was in a few weeks ago to watch a game and I happened to try a very special drink on the menu that completely won me over. Super delicious
__label__4	Tristan was very efficient in getting our papers noterized. We were in and out of the store in less than 5 . He helped us and other customers at the same time.
__label__4	"Ok, I admit it - Indian is low on my ethnic food totem pole.  Not completely at the bottom, that space is reserved for Ethiopian (too mushy for me - like eating a meal of different flavored baby food) but it's down there.  

HOWEVER, there are certain Indian dishes that I really really enjoy and India Palace does them the best.  In particular, the Chicken Tikka Masala is excellent, I think it has a really good balance of creamy and spicy.  

I've only come at lunch time - coworkers love to go to the buffet."
__label__4	A lively bar, a superb location and an unusual menu make this a fun dinner spot. Some of us gave our entrés an A, others a C+, but all were unique and well prepared. Not for everyone, but worth a try... You may love it. Lively on weekend nights. Nice newer addition to Clayton. Patio.
__label__4	"I love Southwest.  They are by far the best airline I've ever ridden.  I love the fact that they don't charge bag fees.  The flight attendants are friendly, and they usually try to make their customers enjoy their experience.  

I just wish they flew international.  I'm going away on my honeymoon, and I'm stuck flying another airline.  And, NO, I WILL NOT fly AirTran...they used to be ValuJet, and I'm mentally stuck on that."
__label__4	Butterscotch latte. Even with a butterscotch flavor add in and breve style the coffee still stands out and isn't watered down. Very happy to have found this place
__label__4	Ordered a shrimp PoBoy to go.  Attentive staff, clean place, good prices . However this time around my bread tasted old .  Almost like they took it out of the freezer and heated it in a microwave.
__label__4	Had a nice meal here tonight, the outside dining area is very nice with plenty of shade, we started we the calamari which was very good and plentiful.  My husband had the trout almondine, with salad and clam chowder. He liked all, but probably filled up to much on the bread basket, lol.  I had the halibut, with the clam chowder and spinach. Liked it all but the spinach, a little to oily. Service was great, would go back if in the area again.
__label__4	Nice elegant atmosphere. Open late, which was good for us looking for a very late dinner at 9:30pm. Good sushi and hot green tea. Fresh and was done fast. Green tea had a nutty taste to it on the finish that was really good...def better than home brew.
__label__4	"This place has a warm and welcoming feel. You will see big families and people in general dinning here. The place is a bit run down, but the food was a great value and decent size portions. I had one of the Sunday Specials 'Carne Asada' and the piece of beef was very large tasty and tender. Then I was asked to add two side dishes to the meal. I picked the fried plantains and chicken soup. I would pass on the soup next time, but everything was great overall. 

The bakery items on the way out looked very affordable and worthy of a look."
__label__4	We had a good meal here.  My only objection was that the courses were served too quickly.  It would have been better if we had more time to enjoy the tastes in between the courses.  Service, otherwise, was good.
__label__4	We came in with a group of 9 and the service from start to finish was excellent. The staff was attentive, patient, and made great recommendations (and were willing to joke around with us too). Both the seafood and steaks were delicious. I highly recommend the baked shrimp and the delmonico steak was also very well seasoned and flavorful. They have a good wine list too. Chophouse would be a good spot for both groups or a date. I highly recommend it and will be back the next time I am in New Orleans (which hopefully will be soon)!
__label__4	Their pumpernickel is the best! Also love the chocolate- cherry  bread. All their other breads seem to have a sourdough base, even challah, which I really don't care for. Had some good cakes by the slice, flourless chocolate, chocolate pound cake, and their cookies are terrific.Millet muffins are nice, if a bit tiny. Their prices are a kind high.
__label__4	Honestly, this place has become my favorite spots in my hometown. Whenever I go back home to Indy, I love a good, farm to table brunch spot and Rize has nailed it for me. It's the perfect light meal with a bright and airy ambiance. The service is always exceptional and the food is great! I hope they only get better from here so I will keep coming back!
__label__4	Really fresh delicious food. Service was wonderful. Everything was delicious. Interesting and beautiful interior.
__label__4	I did not have high expectations just seeing this place from the outside. I was very surprised at how nice the interior is and how good the food is. The atmosphere, food,and service all exceded my expectations.  A very nice addition to the list of places I love in mid-city.
__label__4	Make sure you get on the line as soon as you enter the stadium.  Line get longer as the games progresses. Cheese steaks are made to order and are excellent. They were very accommodating and got my order correct (as I had it without the roll). I'm looking forward to visiting again.
__label__4	"really good massages during the medi-pedi:) Highly recommend
worth $38 :)"
__label__4	Always Excellent Food & Service.  Raw Bar,  Hot Bar,  Peking Duck Station with Sushi.  If you're looking for the best Buffet in the area,  this is the Buffet where most of the Asian Community go to in the area.  Alway Fast, FRIENDLY service even at the busiest of times.
__label__4	Staff are nice, and accommodating. The decor is fun. The free chips and salsa are tasty. We love the fajitas there. This is my favorite restaurant for Mexican food in the area.
__label__4	First time in the area and a huge craft beer fan so I thought I would give this place a try with the family. Went in and got a sample of all their beers and some food. Cool brewery atmosphere, friendly staff, and good food. Overall a great experience and would go back for sure if I was from the area.
__label__4	"Read the comical menu and enjoy the fun with the staff.  Good burgers, hand battered onion rings, tater tots, country fried steak and eggs.  Couldn't have a shake because they were out of vanilla ice cream.  Nice old school diner feel with an open kitchen.
Bathroom is not the best."
__label__4	"This place is a little jewel.
Greeted at the door with a welcome smile!
Our server was delightful. So busy, but very efficient.
We went on a Sunday night.
Tried a speciality drink. Appetizers were fantastic! Great beer selection.
I was visiting my family from out of town, and had such a pleasant time.
Staff is spot on!
By the looks of this local place, the locals have found it. Keep up the good work!"
__label__4	okay, i had the best time at Wednesday night karaoke. I will FER SURE be back.
__label__4	Would have given 5 but slow service. The food was amazing. Recommend the fish BLT- great spice and crusty bread. Definitely would come back.
__label__4	"The atmosphere is still family friendly since it is a non-smoking restaurant but with the constant turnover of staff it isn't as friendly as it used to be.

We noticed there was not as many big parties there this year during Sunday football."
__label__4	"Great new burger restaurant on 124 street.
Fits in well amongst all the great eateries in the area. The restaurant is a perfect mix of fast but good food, with a great casual atmosphere. Great use of the space and I love the couches in the back of the restaurant! My family and I sampled a variety of burgers at their grand opening and really enjoyed all of them!"
__label__4	"Wow 
Nice for local barbecue 

I ordered brisket with potato salad and beans 
Delicious 

Bathrooms are unisex with one being a family room with a baby changing table and a trash can just for diapers 

Our order came out fast 
There are three different sauces at the table for your use   The one that is labeled hot isn't really that hot   At least not New Orleans hot. Spicy flavorful but it's not even Crawfish hot. So try a little or blend it with the other sauces and enjoy a nice kick 

Didn't stay too long basically ordered ate and left"
__label__4	I think petco is just okay. This one is fairly clean but often I find the isles cluttered with restock so I dropped a star for that. Having very little options to get the bulk litter our massive furry felines require, it is still a regular stop for us.
__label__4	The chicken Cobb salad tasted off. The manager replaced it The mushroom and Swiss burger was great. Hardly seen the server. The manager helped with just about everything. She deserves the tip.
__label__4	Crawfish is good and very nice employees .We did like the corn and sausage.
__label__4	Overall for this being in Marshall it is very nice and well organized. Door is releveled in the bottom give me some top Notch Clothing Center. So you're looking for a higher-end Marshalls or more as a middle-class Marshalls then you found your place
__label__4	Was at Orielly's and saw this place. Thought I'd give it a try since I was a bit hungry. Just got 2 slices of pepperoni. Was flavored well and had a crisp crust and it came with ranch. I'd stop here again to try the wings.
__label__4	"I go to Mud House very regularly and it's a great spot! The inside is super cute and cozy and when it's nice outside the patio is an awesome area to sit. The staff and patrons at Mud House are always very welcoming too which is a major plus.

I really like all of their food especially the goat sandwich and the tofu scramble thing they have. I also really enjoy that if you order tea it comes to you with a little bit of cookie to dunk in there. I would like to see their menu change up every now and then though; put a couple new things on the menu."
__label__4	The food was great and the ambiance is fun. Made for a fun date night out with my man. We did not get any ice cream but dinner and drinks were wonderful.
__label__4	Wow! Loving the new space. Took me a while to get by, it's beautiful!  Indy & Fountain Square needed this and I encourage you to go and enjoy.  Comfortable, classy, spacious.  A great selection of wines, and now beer/cocktails are available.  The food menu has expanded and looks tempting.  The hummus appetizer was perfect. I'll be back... often!
__label__4	"I have mixed feelings. I enjoy their food, their pizzas are interesting and the bruschetta is the best, their drinks are cheap and they also have great beers. The service is 50/50. Sometimes it is on point..sometimes it's like trying to bang your head up against the wall expecting a different result each time. (legends tap)
There is outdoor seating, a bar and a 'pizzeria' style seating area with a counter."
__label__4	The people here are always friendly and helpful to explain the menu if you have any questions. Samples are given to help you decide on what to order.  I've been here several times and the food is always good.  The atmosphere here is good day or evenings.
__label__4	Enjoyed our cheesesteaks and the grilled onion, peppers and mushrooms that came with it. Wonderful flavors and fun to watch them grilling them up in front of you. The bread is really good too. May be a bit of a line but we went on Sunday and lines weren't as bad as what we saw on Saturday.
__label__4	I don't usually write up chain supermarkets, but I wanted to write that this particular Publix has a very convenient bakery. I ordered a carrot cake with cream cheese frosting for my father-in-law's birthday. It was ready when I arrived, and it took only minutes to receive it and get back into my car. The cake itself was fine, moist, exactly as ordered. The cream cheese frosting was a tad sweet, but I find that's the case with most bakery frostings.
__label__4	"My friend and I were starving and need a snack to tide us over until our dinner reservations.  We passed this little bakery and were amazed!!  I'm from Erie, PA, and every year in July we have a huge Greek Festival filled with amazing Greek baked goods.  This brought me back to Greek Fest!  

My one rec: get the lady fingers!"
__label__4	Love their vegan skillet! Great local breakfast joint and reasonably priced! Be warned that they are packed weekend mornings so show up early if you don't want to wait!
__label__4	Excellent food! Many of the reviews all agree that the cheesesteak egg rolls are the best you'll ever have. The Ron Burgundy is amazing, and the fries are fresh, and hand cut. The only thing that took away from the experience was there was no air conditioning. It wasn't unbearable, but it was not super comfortable either. Not sure if it was on the blink or what, but I probably would have hung around and had more drinks if it were cooler in there.
__label__4	I haven't had a bad meal and service is quick. Great seafood. Fourth time and will be coming back.
__label__4	All three times I have visited I ordered a new dish and everytime I LOVED IT. Catfish ettouffe is to die for!!! Service is good.
__label__4	"The ambiance is 3 stars

Service is 5 stars

This is a tiny Hard Rock & the ambiance was average. The service I received from the bartender was outstanding! She was funny & very attentive. By far the best thing about this location."
__label__4	Visiting from California and wanted some good BBQ. We had the ribs, cornbread and mac & cheese. Tasty stuff.
__label__4	Holy shiitake!!! Pizza is always good and consistent. My fav of course is the holy shiitake but you can't go wrong with any of them. I've been here several times and the service is always great
__label__4	$2 Taco Tuesday = awesome gourmet tacos and $2 beers. That is all. . .
__label__4	This was our first and favorite stop for music.  We happened to go in the afternoon and there was a singer who was performing solo with a guitar and his voice and musical abilities were wonderful.
__label__4	First experience of New Orleans food and wasn't disappointed. The jambalaya was brilliant.
__label__4	I play on the rec league with my work, but Love playing softball here on Wednesday evenings. There is plenty of parking, and the fields are very well maintained. They always have a concession stand. The games go right at 1 hr and the umpires are pretty fair, and everyone just has a good time and knows each other. I look forward to meeting new people every time i go.
__label__4	The clam chowder was delicious.  The lobster roll was very good but not amazing.  Love the atmosphere and the bartenders were very friendly (but not fake) and attentive.
__label__4	Had their meat lovers Pizza and Margherita pizza.  Both were pretty good.  Leftovers of the meat lovers were good the next day, the other one, not as much
__label__4	"Thanks for the delicious sandwich's 
It's a little far from my folks but worth the trip"
__label__4	This place hit the spot after a day of sun and swimming,  Coming from New Jersey, this reminded me of a basic seafood spot at the Jersey shore.  We both had the broiled seafood platter.  It was good, although the haddock was a bit over-cooked.  I am very picky when it comes to the way my seafood is cooked however.  The scallops were cooked perfectly.  The place is nothing fancy but we were pleased.
__label__4	Big and clean!  They have stuff that I can't find at H-Mart so I visit here every so often.  We haven't tried the food court so I can't compare this one to H-Mart's.  Anyway, if you live in the area, this is a great place to go for Korean and Japanese groceries.
__label__4	A low key home, converted to a casual restaurant.  It gets busy, but the wait is worth it.  A sampler can cover 2 people unless you are very hungry.  The BYO is great!  Just grab some wine or whatever from nearby and enjoy!
__label__4	The atmosphere is great for a date or a girls night out, the music was trendy and loud but not to loud. Everything about this place was super cute, from the sleek bar and pretty bar tenders to the swings they had by the outdoor indoor bar at the back near the game room. Yes I said game room the have a fake room basket ball hoops air hockey etc.
__label__4	What a pleasant surprise! Great bar, great beer selection, friendly staff. Would someone please explain to me the rules of bumper pool? We had a comical time attempting a game. I believe that they have DJ's, Karaoke night, and live music. This bar is defiantly worth checking out!
__label__4	Stopped into this place for lunch while on a road trip.  Clearly popular with the locals, we were definitely not disappointed.  We ordered carne asada tacos, shrimp tacos and pork tamales...everything was fantastic. The chips were just okay, but made better by a delicious pico de gallo from the casual salsa bar.
__label__4	It was a nice place. The pub is clean and the staff was friendly. The food was good too. The staff also came by often to make sure we were happy. I would go back.
__label__4	"I love this spot. Having moved here from Seattle where Asian restaurants abound, I've had a hard time finding a spot in the Nashville area that I can come back to.

King Market has great prices, good, authentic food [their Phad Thai actually tastes like Phad Thai, unlike Smiling Elephant] and quick service.

I've even ordered here for work the morning of an event, and have been able to pick it up just a few hours later.

Hoping this place will stay a hidden gem just a little while longer."
__label__4	I have a love-hate relationship with this place. I love the food. Everything I've had (veg) has been really quite good. Buffet is great. I hate the service. I hate calling in an order, waiting the 45 minutes, coming in and waiting an additional HOUR for my food. Not much to look at, but that's kind of expected with authentic Indian food.
__label__4	I get a real diner vibe from this place. It's a coffee shop that feels just a little more personal the way they take care of you. I really appreciate that sense of community when so many other cafes in this town feel very sterile and cold. I've tried some of the food which was tasty (baked goods especially). Coffee is pretty standard, which is fine by me, especially with free mug refills. One thing to note is it gets a little crazy on the weekend and there isn't a ton of space to accommodate it. Definitely more of a weekday spot for me.
__label__4	"Very nice place. Packed at 11:30 in the morning on a Thursday. Nice atmosphere and pretty loud, making conversation a little difficult.
The ingredients are all very fresh and I could have made a meal of just their thick-sliced wheat bread toast!  You have to look hard to find any meat on the menu and I miss being able to get some crisp hash browns.
This was my first visit here but I think I would definitely go again."
__label__4	I really enjoy most of their appetizers (especially the tots)! Service has always been quick and friendly. Their late night bar menu is a little lacking but passible for a late dinner. My husband really loves the wings and cheesesteaks.
__label__4	"(4) ~ very good local chocolatier.  

OUR MENU:
** The Christopher 1 Pound Peanut Butter Cup = (4) very good
** Chocolate covered Potato Chips = (4) very good
** Carmallows = (4) very good
* Chocolate covered Marshmallows = (3.5) good
* Sea Salt Chocolate Caramels = (3.5) good
* Chocolate Peanut Butter Fudge = (3) ok"
__label__4	Voodoo has always creeped me out.  But if you are into the stuff, then this place is definitely for you.  They have a lot of things here that you arent supposed to touch without the assistance of someone else. They looked more like potions to me? I enjoyed the postcards, stickers, magnets, and other gifts they had there though. Definitely stuff you cant find anywhere else in the states.
__label__4	"Firestones has the best patio in Wilmington. It's a large area and covered - plenty of room for dancing. There is seating available at the outdoor bar or lounge seats closer to the water. The nightly music offerings are awesome - especially Wed nights when they have Hump Day with HyJinx.  Happy Hour on the riverfront makes this a popular spot for local office workers.

While the food isn't the greatest, the half price pizza night is helpful.  That is why I rated this under ""Nightlife"" as opposed to ""Restaurant""."
__label__4	Great comfort food including meatloaf, Shepard's pie, sliders and live music on the patio...just like a Midwestern local bar, but in Clearwater, Fl.  Great place to eat if you're going to Ruth Eckherd or Coachman Park events.
__label__4	They did an amazing job on my nails. The only problem is they take a very very long time. A refill (gel) took an hour with no waiting for a nail tech.
__label__4	"Hurricanes are amazing. Listening to two people on ""dueling pianos"" with hurricanes is even better. This place is awesome."
__label__4	Great lunch place. We will definitely return here. The Thai Chicken Currie soup was delicious. My wife ways that the Reuben Sandwich is the best in the Boise area!  My Mediterranean Sandwich was great too. Friendly service, and very nice setting. Like I said, it was a great lunch!
__label__4	Chicken tenders and sandwiches are always great. Hubby loves their milkshakes. Due to Covid-19, they got rid of their Heath shakes.
__label__4	Love the food! Black spaghetti is amazing! Been to this location four times now.  Friday nights they are super packed and the service needed improvement. I have been multiple times during happy hour and our waitress Sarah was amazing! She knows the all the dishes and will help with selections.  You can tell that she really loves working there because she describes the dishes perfectly!
__label__4	Awesome service and great location!! Ask to see if Angie is working and ask her about the best drink!!!
__label__4	We went there last night. We got the grilled and blackened red fish. Both were awesome and we'd go back for sure .
__label__4	I'm a local, and have been coming here for many years. So I guess that makes me a regular. Always pleased with the food quality and service. They have some great breakfast specials as well.
__label__4	Visited here a few months ago. I ordered the chicken parm sub, and it was pretty decent. The seitan was kinda chewy- so i thought that might have been overcooked. My boyfriend had the cheesesteak pizza, and that was actually amazing. I'd probably go back for that again soon.
__label__4	Great restaurant... The swordfish, sheepshead, and scallops were amazing. The drum fish was a little dry but still delicious. Lastly the ban-nilla was tasty but the creme brûlée was dynamite. Tasty wine list too Caymus or Chateauneuf-du-Pape are classics with any meal.
__label__4	"I like the lunch I like the chili verde Chimichanga's really good The Taste is excellent they are skimping on the pork in the Chimichanga's. I know because I go to the Midtown one and they have lots of pork cubes in the chimi.
I'm looking forward to going to happy hour getting a big giant margarita"
__label__4	Boscov's is truly the epitome of what an old fashion family built and owned business is what it's all about !!!! Every detail is not overlooked from the friendly, helpful, courteous staff to the  little extra special things like free gift wrapping!  The bottom line is Boscov's is everything Nordstrom is without the prices !!!
__label__4	This was our third and final stop last night on our Webster restaurant hop, dinner... I had the flank steak which came with sautéed potatoes, Chinese broccoli and pattypan squash with red wine reduction. Was cooked perfect, a touch too much salt for my taste, my husband loved it. He had a wild salmon over Parmesan dumplings with micro greens, perfection.
__label__4	Good food and friendly staff. Can't go wrong here for good barbeque. Don't feel shy about bringing the kids or some friends cause even though it's a small place, the seating is nice and comfortable.
__label__4	Unlike my experience at another location of this chain I went in again to give them an opportunity for redemption. I had a wonderful meal. Everything was well-cooked well-balanced the service was excellent and so was the comfort level. they feature the usual breakfast menu and also the usual lunch menu standard American fare done well.
__label__4	Went out to the Nora restaurant with the Devour Indy special to see what kind BBQ was to be had.   Had a sample of every meat in the house.   Only the brisket was a touch dry- still flavorful though.    In house sauces were all good as well.   Would recommend if in the mood for BBQ
__label__4	Great food, great service and great drinks.  I had a Pims drink and grilled red fish salad soup yum!
__label__4	I just cannot stop myself from coming here for HH!  You can't beat the cherry stones for a buck each!  I mean yes is crowded ... very crowded (always) but it's so worth it!  Hmmmm maybe I shouldn't advertise that .  They do have hot apps on special too during HH but I can never get past the raw bar!  I mean those cherrystones no one else offers them vs oysters which everyone else does! Plus they also have a very tasty bubbly that goes fabulously with my addiction ... I mean clams!
__label__4	"Gavas was my go to place for alterations. The ladies at the store are very friendly. 

I do not particularly enjoy their weird scheduling, but I'm alright with it given their service is usually good for the value."
__label__4	The food here was very good. The menu is full of great comfort foods paired with lighter salads. My only complaint is that our server was a bit 'cold' and markedly absent for longer periods of time. Otherwise it was great and I'd definitely visit again.
__label__4	"First visit: The burger was awesome. The fries were awesome. The server was friendly and attentive, if a bit of a low talker. 

Second visit: The roast beef wasn't great. The fries were awesome. The server was friendly but stretched thin."
__label__4	Ordered the broccoli beef and king pao chicken. The food was good but on the bland side. I see why they do it that way because people are so picky. So when you order, make sure you have the soy sauce or salt and pepper ready to go.
__label__4	It's a small place but we were sat down very quickly a lot of people here which is a good sign that the food is good. I had the chicken Parm which came with the salad and I have to say it was one the biggest portions I've ever gotten in my life also it was delicious. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants good Italian food
__label__4	We ordered pizza for delivery not knowing anything about Monty's, just that they were close to our hotel. We were super impressed, cheesy, meaty goodness! Quick delivery, I would definitely order from there next time we are in Edmonton!
__label__4	Delicious food, fantastic wines, great service, pleasant atmosphere!  Waitstaff always greet you with a smile.  They have different specials throughout the year.  One of my favorite restaurants.
__label__4	Katie's is awesome! I love their Insalata Mista and Fried Artichoke salad. Their Lemon Strozzpreti is the BEST!!! The pizza leaves a little something to be desired but salads and pasta are great!
__label__4	Have stopped a few times for lunch. Has high turn over which is usually a sign of poor management in some area. Place is clean with plenty of space to relax. Food has been great tasting with large portions. A bit pricey but not bad. They do charge a 20% gratuity automatically on your bill. Not sure if they get a lot of non tippers or it's their way to take tips from the wait staff. We tip cash as well but it make one wonder. All in all, a very nice experience every time. Worth a try.
__label__4	excellent but extremely Pricey!  Lunch for two with one appetizer and 2 blueberry infused vodkas for $75 plus tip.  Ouch!
__label__4	"Looking for a good cup of tea is oftentimes a futile effort... but not when one finds a cafe' such as this.  When I presented my request (Earl Grey Vanilla Latte') they didn't blink and presented me with a fantastic tea experience.

Yes, they may be small, but they know tea.

I also partook of a slice of their red velvet cake.

Just perfect.  :)

Alert to tea lovers like myself.  Skip any chain places.  This is where is REAL hot tea is to be found."
__label__4	Came here for the first time a few weeks and had a burger and fries with a drink. Both the burger and fries were good. Recently opened near in the heart of Broadway, near the Bridgestone Arena, Broadway and the National African American Music Museum. The service was nice and quick.
__label__4	My favorite Chinese resturant in town. Love the ma po tofu, pork with tofu and green peppers, and the dan dan sichuan spicy noodles. Best Sichuanese food I've found in Philly, and it's just a tad less spicy than the real stuff. I ordered it extra spicy once and it was overkill!
__label__4	I've always wanted to try this place. Got an order of pupusas, enchilada Mexicana and flautas to go. Delicious food but I was disappointed the flautas were very overdone.
__label__4	"This is a decent korean restaurant for a reasonable price. It does not have mama's korean house high quality of food, while eating a full meal at mama's will set you back $40 - 60. Bando makes up the quality with a reasonable all-you-can-eat price of $35! It is a steal!

This also a perfect place for college students and young adults to gather, eat great food, all the while not emptying their wallet."
__label__4	"I really like this place since the transition from the Tilted Kilt! I always sit on the porch! Spenser is always friendly and puts my Phillie games on every time! 

The Meazta pizza is delicious!

Miller lite and fireball on Happy hour...you can't go wrong!!!!!"
__label__4	Love their brunch on weekends and roast beef poboy sandwich, mimosas check, bloody mary check, good service check and the best part is that they're right around the corner where I live so I just have to walk. Yayyyy!
__label__4	Amazing Food. Horrible drinks and service, which would have been cause for three stars but the food was just absolutely delicious. No more pricey than other nice seafood spots on the beach.
__label__4	Relaxing, fast, quality job. New to the area and Steve gave me a few recommendations. I live nearby, couldn't be happier, I will definitely return and bring my roommate next time!
__label__4	"Melt in your mouth cheesesteaks!

Yummy!  I had mine with white american cheese as recommended by the girl at the counter as her favorite.  Wash it down with a local brew - a perfect lunch for a day of walking around olde city Philadelphia.  

Family owned and the whole family seems to work here - great food, fun atmosphere - loved it."
__label__4	"I've been back twice in March, and neglected to write my update before now.

Nothing really new here.  The pizza really has to be the best in town.  The crust is always perfect.  Ted the waiter is still impeccable.  The rest of the menu is always good.  When the check comes, it's always reasonable.

Where else in NPR could you possibly be getting a better pie?!"
__label__4	"It was nice to see a West Indian restaurant in a down town location.  I was only able to get the curry chicken due to arriving near closing time. I will say that the food is spot on with regards to taste and flavors.  The cabbage is made properly and their special sauce is excellent if you need a little kick. 

I plan to return and try the jerk chicken if they have any left. -_-"
__label__4	Friendly people. The crust is great.
__label__4	"Meet up with colleagues at the bar. Nice little place.

About the beer:
The had a great beer selection. Something for everyone.

About the service:
Nice server, knew the beers (this is not always the case at places with long beer menus).

Atmosphere:
It was a little loud since they had a singer and keyboard player performing. Nice decor. Comfortable. Great location next near the Arch."
__label__4	Had been there to check in surface headphones and was wowed by the stuff the staff knew and their willingness to help. The guy helping me was kind enough to set the surface headphone up for me and then let me be. Usually folks try to interfere and keep giving information, which I don't like. Pretty impressed.
__label__4	Super fun, lighter fare with lots of charcuterie boards, a myriad of bruschetta options, fun vibe and good service.  We will return.
__label__4	Love this place.  Great food, clean bathrooms, and good service.
__label__4	Went to Sunset Bistro on Labor Day for breakfast and enjoyed it. However the most notable thing was the excellent attitude of our server. We could tell she was the only one working so when she came to our table she apologized  for the delay and I asked if they were short today. She said we have 2 people just quit. Losing any employees is bad enough but on a holiday! She remained pleasant and so was the cook who came out so serve. We will return and I hope they find the right staff. Bravo!
__label__4	"The staff was friendly and helpful. It was easy to drop off the suit I needed dry cleaned, and I picked it up the same day. 

The only reason I am giving it one less star, was because I was going there for the drop off service. But they do not deliver downtown which is soo close! 

Otherwise great service, and price!"
__label__4	Never had a bad experience at this restaurant. Food is always great and service is phenomenal
__label__4	The surrounding neighborhood is really pretty. The park itself isn't often well-maintained in terms of grooming the plants and lawns. But I really love the lake and the swans and ducks that live there. The swans are friendly and will eat grass or bread out of your hand if you're patient.
__label__4	Solid diner food with nice prices w/fast service. Nice crispy potatoes & good feta for omelette.
__label__4	"Heard about this place from a local and had to give it a try. They did not disappoint, it was definitely the best pulled pork sandwich in town!!

Great patio to relax, have few beers and good food away from the tourist scene! 

Don't forget to get the fried pie! Yum!"
__label__4	A great little dive bar, good service and great tuna steak burgers!
__label__4	Ok sushi place, nice staff. I liked the butterfly and also the soft shell crab roll. The appetizers are good too. If stay away from the hibachi, they are cooked in the back and it's just ok. The sushi is priced well but the hibachi is not worth it. Since when did sushi have cream cheese in it? I hate cream cheese and so many of the sushi choices contain cream cheese! However there is plenty to choose from and there great. Again, good value and service.
__label__4	Great prices especially when you use the coupons that come in the mail or newspaper.  Clean and bright store with many enticing prices.  I had a gift card for $100 and I was able to buy 2 sets of jeans, 2 leather, well-made belts and with a few extra bucks of my own, a great food processor.  Very gracious checkers, friendly and cheerful and seemed happy to be there.  (December 30 at about 11:30am to 12:30pm). I'll definitely be back.
__label__4	We went back last week and everything was fantastic, changing this to 4 stars.
__label__4	I would recommend getting the Garlic Knockers & the Taco Pizza! Both were delicious! The food & drinks are a little expensive, but worth it. Also, I wanted to mention how the staff was super friendly and polite.
__label__4	It's very good but the service can be spotty and the wait is too long. I've rarely left this place in under 45 min.
__label__4	Food was ok. The four stars is for the takeout process. It was ready in just 10 mins which was great. Although I don't understand the limit of $50 for carry out orders. I had to place two separate orders which was annoying. If I'm paying for it all up front I don't see what the problem is with a bigger order.
__label__4	4 stars for the wonderful service and the amazing crab fingers.  My boyfriend ordered the crab cake as an appetizer and it was delicious and full of crab. My wedge salad was nothing special-I wouldn't order it again. The BBQ shrimp po boy was good but very rich. They have a huge selection of bourbon. I'd definitely return for the crab fingers.
__label__4	I stumbled upon this place for breakfast. I ordered a some buttermilk pancakes which were very tasty it came with a side of grits which was very tasty as well just not enough, serving size was too small. The service was great and the food didn't take long to come out. I will visit again.
__label__4	A bit pricey but the place has all the things a person needs to cook Asian foods. It's a one-shop must!
__label__4	The cupcake I got was pretty good! I wish the pricing was a tad cheaper though. But there were plenty of flavors to choose from! So I think I wll be going back very soon!! :D
__label__4	Best sushi place in Reno. That being said - unfortunately, Reno isn't  blessed with a lot of outstanding Sushi restaurants. Only annoying is the fact that they don't take reservations under 5 people & the wait is always at least 30-45 minutes if you don't arrive right when they open.
__label__4	"UPDATE: DMV contacted me about how we could resolve my issue through yelp. That definitely shows me they care, which makes me very happy :-) one of the main things that many businesses fail with is follow up. I love the idea of text while waiting and I understand that sometimes things don't launch perfectly the first time. Apparently, there is a computer glitch and you should NOT hit ""M"" for ""More Time"" because somehow 50 people trickle in front of you in line. Good to know and thank you for the information. Hope people read this and NOT TYPE ""M"""
__label__4	I love this place. I'm pretty picky with my burgers, and I've loved every single one that I've tried here. The best fries that I've had, ever. Staff is pretty hit or miss as I've had great and bad experiences with them here. All in all, it's a really fun place to eat with it's unique environment and decor. Would recommend anyone to try it, you'll love it!
__label__4	Perfect date night!  We called ahead so the pizza would be ready when we arrived and it was perfect.  We ordered the gluten free crust and it tasted just like real pizza with toppings piled high.  Staff was friendly and courteous.  Prices are reasonable.  Nice parking lot.  Only complaint is the 70s disco music was awful but we will be back.
__label__4	"Self service frozen yogurt bar with variety of toppings. The frozen yogurt was creamy & smooth. Their flavors change but they also have the staples like chocolate, vanilla & such. 
The fruits available as toppings were diverse. Although the strawberries were not very fresh, it may have to do with the season."
__label__4	Went for a late brunch. They served a small breakfast buffet and Cajun style foods. We had the breakfast buffet (eggs, bacon, sausage, biscuits, gravy, mini pancakes, and fruit) for 10$ and fancy iced espresso drinks (4$). The covered patio style dining was great and relaxing! There was a live jazz band that was awesome. Really enjoyed this little place before heading down the street to the market!
__label__4	Awesome, clean and straight up, bring cash and enjoy!
__label__4	Great service, cool and sportsbar-ish. Po-boys are awesome.
__label__4	They always have plenty of fresh pies to choose slices from, and they're cheesesteaks are great. Can't go wrong here...
__label__4	great food but I'm writing this 13 hours after eating the ghost pepper wings and I haven't left the bathroom. They closed and reopened the restaurant, and I'm still not finished. Somebody please send some help. Thank you. Consider yourself warned
__label__4	"My mom LOVES the Mocha Cake with cashew nuts so I got her it for her a 7"" one for birthday and although it took her a few days, she did finish it (which is VERY RARE!)

I also got my brother a Rocky Road Brownie that he liked."
__label__4	Awesome tacos! Delicious seafood! Would definitely go back for more and to try new dishes.
__label__4	"I LOVE a GOOD BURGER and you can definitely get one at Burger Monger.    This concept is similar to Five Guys.   I think Burger Monger has better atmosphere... less noise and great service.  

I split a 6 oz burger and the 1/2 lb portion of fries with a friend and it was just the right amount of food."
__label__4	Our team, Save a Horse Ride a Ragnar finished up our 2015 TN Ragnar having a celebratory dinner at Merchants.  Food was great, came out decently quick for their being such a large table to serve and it being a busy Saturday night.  Atmosphere where we sat was casual and an enjoyable place to eat where we could have decent conversation (although I believe upstairs in the restaurant it a little fancier).
__label__4	I've gotten a tattoo, and a tongue piercing here. Everything was done to my liking, and everything healed perfectly fine.
__label__4	"Hearing Ochatto have another restaurant, I knew I have to give it a try. So of course this is my first dinner back in Philly. 
Pros:
- Amazing decorated restaurants located in the heart of university city
- Friendly standard service brings a smile to my face 
- Menu offers more than just hot pot and well-known Szechuan dish 
- Spicy hot pot is very good and personalized to your liking
Cons:
- Could be a bit pricy, each topping is around $5-6"
__label__4	"the Columbus Inn I enjoy be here on Fridays!
Their Happy Hour is GREAT!
gets a little crowded, hard to find parking, a little loud, but food is very good, prices are very fair, service excellent.....matre'd or manager is exceptional
I bring my Ha Hr group here often, and EVERYONE enjoys coming to Columbus Inn for Ha Hr"
__label__4	"They do offer some great food and it is a great place to meet.

I will say, it does take some time to get food if very busy."
__label__4	Love the burgers and sweet potato fries.  I like the Mississippi Mud beer too. I always have had great service. It is a busy place so you may have to share a common table but they are roomy
__label__4	Definitely the best pizza in Nashville. There's often a really long wait for dinner (especially on weekends) but you can call ahead to pick up a pie or just grab a drink nearby while you wait for a table. There's also the slice window which is great. The South Brooklyn pizza is my favorite by far. They also have a good beer selection. I think this location has better food than the location on Charlotte.
__label__4	"Update:  I really wanted to like this place so we went back for dinner, this time had the BBQ fried oysters which were awesome and full of flavor.  Also had the Grilled Grouper which was excellent too.  Apparently I must've had a bad batch of the Jambalaya that might have been sitting around for a while.  

Anyways the place redeemed themselves and our waiter (Jason) was great.  I'd recommend this place, hopefully they'll keep up the great food."
__label__4	We've been coming to this venue for several years now with company Christmas parties..i have to say that over the past couple years, the food has gotten significantly better! Very delicious food. The venue is nice. I will give full 5 stars if they update the outdoor view. It looks really old and run down outside. Needs a little TLC! Great place thou, will keep coming back as long as they're serving delicious food!
__label__4	"Awesome place! 

You can miss it if you're not looking for it. It's on the east side of Campbell!

Great Coffee. Great Tea. Great side items. Great Staff!

If you're there with a friend, it just enhances your whole experience!"
__label__4	The atmosphere and food were both good. I had the sweet potato hash, and it was delicious. I wish the portion size had been a bit bigger but it was tasty nonetheless.
__label__4	So far so good for this traditional Iron Hill...it's pretty much just like the rest of them but that's a good thing.  Ardmore needed a larger venue like this for eating out and grabbing a drink.  Parking is a pain at this entire shopping center but just park next to the fire house to be safe!
__label__4	"There are some things this place knocks out of the park (shrimp kabob... shrimp cooked perfectly) and others that are kind of ""meh"" (chocolate chip waffle).

The outdoor seating is nice (albeit the tables are a little wobbly), but on a summer morning, the awnings remind me of a nice day at the pool.

We would highly recommend the kabobs, everything else is sort of a pass."
__label__4	"It's true that this place gets crazy busy during lunch... but it is worth the wait, in my opinion.

The stir fries are just out of this world. Normally I scoff at ordering stir fry in a restaurant since I make them all the time at home, but this was a whole other level: thin, chewy egg noodles doused in a silky garlic sauce with fresh vegetables, super tangy pickles and a sprinkling of fried onion bits. I also added shrimp to mine, so it filled my stomach perfectly without being too much food. 

I will definitely be back."
__label__4	"Fun atmosphere and quirky decorations made this a fun visit. We started with poutine, which was made from Tetris-shaped Mexifries. The cheese sauce with real bacon bits was good, but could have used more sauce on the fries. I didn't love the pretzel - it didn't have the right texture, but I appreciate the effort on the real cheese sauce.

The pizza was so-so. I think what struck me most was the sauce was sweet. Not my favorite.

The staff was friendly and helpful."
__label__4	Beautiful and educational. I really liked the experience we had here learning about the war. There were so many great exhibits and we went at a quiet time of the year so we didn't have to wait around to see what we wanted. We needed a break from drinking and if you like history and need a break from the Bourbon St/drinkfest like we did, come here!
__label__4	"I had the chips, mac & cheese, the white bean & shrimp and the pecan dessert and a glass of wine. Over $50!!!!!  I really like the food.  It was not typical fare.  Dared to be different, but $9 for mac & cheese.  Should be $7.  

The atmosphere was good; the food was good, but not sure if I will be a regular.  Bring down the prices to get repeat customers."
__label__4	"This store is a nice size and the employees are really enthusiastic in helping you but keeping the line moving. There is an area in the back with books for ideas and chairs that is kept pretty well.
I don't forget to look up coupons on their website!"
__label__4	"pork belly buns are good but they are so expensive! not worth 3 bucks a bun. 

The ramens are all consistently good, with good meats. The soup base isn't too salty, though I have a hard time distinguishing between them. A good place to go for a solid bowl of ramen. Better than several others in the city that I've tried."
__label__4	I needed someone quick to pick up some pizza and this was the first place that popped up on yelp. I gave it a try and I'm glad that I did. The price is reasonable and the pizza portion sizes are huge. Definitely worth a try if you're looking for a non-chain pizza place that tastes good.
__label__4	The pasta was fantastic. Tasted very fresh. The pizza could have been better. Ambience was nice.
__label__4	Very touristy but it's a cool place just to check out. The skating rink is worth going on just to say you did it. It's a roller rink in summer and they freeze it to make it an ice skating rink during winter. Very crowded but centrally located to many things..  Walking distance to South street and Dave and Buyer's along with the water taxis to Camden.  Highly recommended for anyone.
__label__4	"I picked up some shredded beef tacos,  they were delicious, The carne asada burrito I totally recommend, the only thing that was not as good was the guacamole and chips, the guacamole was tasty but chips were not crunchy. 
I can't wait to try their breakfast burritos."
__label__4	We really liked this place! Service was good, but all of the employees are pretty young so I guess you can't really expect exceptional service. We loved our room, modern decor and VERY clean. Oh and bed was super comfy! Nice water stations on every floor was a great touch. Beautiful restaurant on ground floor, but we didn't eat there. Fantastic location, recommend a walk along the river in the morning down to The Hub coffee shop! Overall a very nice addition to Reno, we will definitely be back!!!
__label__4	Authentic Mexican place. The owner is wonderful and welcoming. Definitely a neighborhood gem
__label__4	We were very happy with BurgerFuel! We went on a whim because we were in the area and loved pretty much everything. We really appreciate the care in quality ingredient sourcing and environmentally conscious packaging for their products. The staff was super helpful when we had questions or needed something extra. We loved the Bastard and pickle fries best! The house-made aiolis were amazing. We will definitely back next time we are in Bripp.
__label__4	Great little place. I took my Fenchies in for nail trimming. The shop was clean, neat and smelled good.
__label__4	I had a tasty Chipotle & Black Bean Burrito with BE Hive chipotle seitan, black beans, tomatoes, avocado, salsa Verde, spinach, rice, vegan sour cream and a side of chickpea salad!! YES!! It's great to be back!! The people were friendly and helpful with what was tasty to order.
__label__4	such a lovely find!  Most wines are under $16 and there is a nice selection of many varietals.  We did a wine tasting with them - $10 for 6 tastes - and I think the price goes down if you buy wines.  a really nice way to spend a few hours on a Saturday afternoon.  And check out their adorable patio if the weather is nice!
__label__4	Char grilled oysters are bomb. Crab cakes are awesome. Def a tourist attraction... line can be long, sometimes out the door. First timers - it's prob worth the wait
__label__4	My expectations were really low because I assumed that the food would be an afterthought considering it's at an airport. However, I was wrong. My friend had a yummy waffle, my wrap was really nice and my husband devoured his swordfish tacos. They were also super kid friendly and had no problem catering to a 3 year old. The views are pretty cool and it was fun to sit outside and watch the planes takeoff/land.
__label__4	Ordered through doordash. The Crab Rangoon's were really good - have never had them with broccoli mixed in with the cream cheese. Pad Thai with chicken was good - just needed a little more peanut sauce for my liking. Very good option for delivery.
__label__4	I went to the market for the second time. There are lots of places to eat and purchase fresh fruit and produce. It is crowded especially during the holiday seasons. overall, I like reading terminal market and will come back when I back to philly.
__label__4	"Again, I love Primo's hoagies. They are great but they ain't cheap. The Exton branch is a good location. Service is usually really good though they do get backed up around lunch time during the week so you may want to call ahead. I recommend anything on their ""Diablo"" menu."
__label__4	I recently moved to Gulfport from France and this has been my best meal in the area yet (This includes St Pete). Super evening out with delicious food and great service. Server was very friendly, funny and patient with my friend's energetic 4 year old, which was a bonus. We will be back and we definitely recommend Peg's!
__label__4	"I recently officiated a wedding at PPP and thought the venue was pretty cool. I've been to a lot of wedding venues in the area and this one is definitely different than the rest. If you're looking for an intimate smaller setting this would be a good option. 

Aside from weddings, this would be a great place to rent for an office Holliday party or a business event. It has a cool industrial/lounge kinda vibe to it. 

The staff I got to interact with was very friendly and quick to assist when needed. Definitely worth checking out if your looking for a unique event venue."
__label__4	I ate here the other day for lunch. I definitely will go back. I had 2 chicken tamales with chips and a drink. I will have to say-- these are the best tamales that I have had in Tucson. I am more of a fan of the Cuban style tamales of my youth-- but these are still super good for Sonoran style. They tasted super fresh and were wrapped in the traditional corn husks. I might try the veggie style next time. I will be back :)
__label__4	Check in was quick and easy. The customer service agent was polite,  courteous and efficient. However, when we arrived in the garage to pick up the van the manager in charge created a bit of chaos about the amount of people to seat belt ratio and insisted we change to a larger van. I very clearly told her I would not pay for a larger van so they would have to give it to me for the price I reserved so after some back and forth, she found a van and gave me the same price. The rest of the transaction as well as the return went smoothly.
__label__4	Really loud in here but super fun for after work happy hour. Music is fun and upbeat. Atmosphere is quintessential Irish Bar. We mostly drank beer but also ordered some nachos to share and they were amazing. Even though they were busy (night before the super bowl parade) our server was very attentive.
__label__4	I love coming here for the clam chowder. It has an awesome view if you choose to sit outside. The drinks are good and strong which you can't really complain about. They are generally always busy so the wait can sometimes be really long but what we usually do while we wait is walk down toward the beach and watch people jet ski or the boats that are out there and pretty much just enjoy the view.
__label__4	"I thought this place was decent! Not the best, but not terrible. 

If you're craving Indian food while downtown, I believe this is one of the few spots available. Service was great. I like that there were a few tables outside. The interior decor was nice. 

Food was good for the most part, however, it could have been a bit more flavorful I think. I enjoyed the tea that they served, it was a nice touch. 

Might return if I have a strong craving for Indian food downtown.

Will add that the garlic naan was delicious"
__label__4	"Nice clean store that is well stocked with just about everything you need. We use this location when we are in town vacationing and even get some ""basic grocery items"" when we first get into town. Usually our go to for our sunscreen and other things needed while on vacation"
__label__4	Good Indian food (punjabi) and reasonabe prices. the food was fresh, and not overly spicy. their vegetable korma dish is great!
__label__4	Pretty good pizza for thin crust. Get the seasonal salad with the sweet house dressing. It will fill you up.
__label__4	"Another dinner visit.......very nice despite rain.   Service seems more attentive, and food was delivered faster than ever.   Had great oysters, and will be back for more. Also the lobster prison has been removed, so PETA supporters can come have a nice salad.

Also construction on the Columbus Bridge is days from completion, and that will make getting there much easier by land........easy as always by boat, kayak or inner-tube."
__label__4	Went there on a Saturday night   It was busy. I would make reservations. We ended up eating in the bar area because the hostess said our table wasn't ready. It was a bit loud.  But in a lively way. The food was good. It's Tavern food.  No big surprises.  Service was good.  Had to send a dish back.  And there was no grief.  The cobbler dessert was a winner.
__label__4	Love this place. Al is great with my Berner Solomon.
__label__4	My toddlers had the BEST time! Such a cute thing they have going on with plenty of activities for everyone in the family. Food is WAY overpriced and not good. It also took us 50 minutes to get our freezer grade cheeseburgers!! That was absolutely ridiculous. Besides the food being a blow, we had a blast!
__label__4	Best veggie burger in the whole world, discovered when I was a vegetarian but continue to choose it over a regular burger now that I'm eating meat. Try it!  You also cannot go wrong with a ceasar salad and pomegranate martini
__label__4	Tasty Indian food and oh so affordable. I love how the menu distinguishes dishes from the North or South.
__label__4	I had they're chicken saag and garlic naan. It was reallyyy good! Bread tastes fresh and the mango smoothie is so thick and delicious. Must try.
__label__4	Good Tex Mex.  Probably not the most authentic, but they had good big stuffed quesadillas and carnitas platter.  The dink menu was limited and the margarita was made from a medium grade mix.  I prefer to pay a little more and get better quality drinks.  Service was friendly and fast.
__label__4	"I stopped in today and was surprised to find the store was rearranged since my last visit (probably a few years ago). I asked the cashier if she could help me and she quickly pointed out what I was looking for.

In my haste to be in and out, I grabbed an item of higher price and they swapped it out for a quick exchange (although it took a few tries on the technical end!)"
__label__4	Awesome pizza. The best Ive had in Tampa...and the closest you can get to authentic NY pizza
__label__4	One of the best persian restaurants in FL. family owned business and friendly environment. For lunch there is buffet with different kind of persian food which is so perfect. Kabob is tasty and juicy.
__label__4	Very lively environment and atmosphere. Staff is friendly and seated us quickly. We ordered the veggie pizza which came out in a timely manner. The pizza was very tasty, all the best and complementary flavors you can ask for in veggie pizza. The crust was absolutely perfect and crunchy, but not burnt. There was some live music which was a nice touch! I'll be coming back to try the beers on tap'
__label__4	Great hole in the wall place and the food is decent but not the best value for Ethiopian cuisine in the neighborhood. The drinks are great prices and the wait is a little on some nights but amazing live music is the best reason to come here
__label__4	Best ramen that we have had in Stl. Our group loved the make your own, especially the tofu. I had seafood ramen. Broth not salty. We will definitely return.
__label__4	"Great Chicago style stuffed pizza.
 (Please note that this is NOT the same as Chicago style deep dish pizza...you still need to drive to the Chicago area for that.

Very good appetizers as well."
__label__4	"LovePizza is great!  It's so clean and fresh, lots of light.
Pizza is soooooo good.  Love the crust.  Always has a fun, new special to try out... orrrrr if you're like me, I stick to the Plain Jane."
__label__4	I've never been here, well just  Forever 21 and Scheels. Hmmm gotta shop here more often. Ive been driving out to Summit...which is awesome, but it's nice to have some of the same stores in Sparks. It's clean and the variety of stores is great. My daughter loved the Sanrio store. We will be doing a lot more shopping here.
__label__4	Excellent breakfast!!! The home fries are unbelievable. Get there early as it fills up quickly. Service is just so so.
__label__4	The coffee is a five star by far. The food? A bit more hot and miss, and they could up the appeal factor a bunch by decluttering the counter and working on presentation. In a tiny hamlet next to Swarthmore College, though, they have a kind of captive audience and it's heavily patronized by students and faculty so it doesn't incentivize much need to up their game. A fine place to grab a cup of coffee on a cold day!
__label__4	I'm quickly becoming a regular here! Outside is a great place to hang with friends and meet new people. So much to do! Rent jet skis, pull up your boat, chill at the bar with live music or play sand volley ball! Oh or jump on the mechanical SHARK! Ahhhh! Yummy food too :) Try the blackened grouper sliders they will rock your world! Big fan!
__label__4	This was a pretty good meal. I really enjoyed the zucchini pancakes and the eggplant salsa surprised me when I realized it was cold, but I still liked it. My group liked it also.  My only issue was that there was no where to change my baby's diaper.
__label__4	This place wasn't bad. I was happy with my gel fill and pedicure. Although it took too long and she didn't shape one of my nails correctly.
__label__4	Always great place to go for tasty, healthy food in a nice clean restaurant to eat at. Definitely recommend this place for a meal solo or with the family or friends.
__label__4	"Oceana grill was a definite tourist spot.

In short, the food was pretty good but not spectacular. But customer service was amazing. The waiters and managers are so welcoming and caring it's not hard to love the place. 

My favorite dish had to be the blackened alligator bite Po Boy and their oysters. Have these for dinner and I know you won't be disappointed!"
__label__4	Let make why one star less statement first. Passing security control, what is necessary, unprofessional attitude of young gentleman lucking appropriate training set first impression of the venue. Otherwise, it's a very nice Arena. We like coming here and support  variety events.
__label__4	Beignets so yummy !!! I was glad about the convenience of the coffee shop. The personalities of the employees were friendly and the atmosphere was the same. Located in the Hilton riverside New Orleans(river walk outlet mall).
__label__4	Definitely a hidden gem. First they stayed open past 8 so we could get our pick up order. 2ndly the chicken tikka masala was great, we went with the mild which was perfect. I'm not used to so many veggies in it but if that's your preference you'll love it. The samosa was nice and spicy how we like it. For the 2 of us we got 2 orders oh naan Bc it's so good we knew we wouldn't want to share.
__label__4	"When you pay $60 for a cake they can't even write ""Happy Birthday"" on, only to have them make it a day later than you ordered it for and not refund you or even say sorry. Very disappointed to have loved this all vegan place to have it ruined by bad management.

Addendum: Glad to see this place has an awesome owner who called me to sort this out! Thank you!"
__label__4	Be prepared to wait, its a little slower than most fast food restaurant  but worth the wait,Very tasty hot subs.
__label__4	Love this place! The staff is amazing, the reader Charlie is on point! Definitely recommend coming here and grabbing a few gifts and getting a reading.
__label__4	Solid Vietnamese cafe style restaurant.  No bells and whistles.  Nice spring rolls, but the beef in the Pho was nothing to crow about.  Probably better earlier I'm lunch rush.  Generally a great addition to the area, ESP since the demise of green leaf.
__label__4	Nice people. Reasonably priced. Reminded me of my cousin's shop back east. If you are looking for a nice basic shop for maintenance this is the place. Thanks guys!
__label__4	I visited White Sage before when owner Greer was there. She was awesome. I visited yesterday and had a different esthetician. Very pleasant and relaxing facial. My skin looked great. Sugaring on brows and lip done excellently. I think during facial esthetician should provide more feedback on products being used. Also I had to tell her my concerns. I think a very nice and capable young woman, perhaps just needs to communicate more with the client to provide a more customized experience as opposed to just getting you in and out. Still recommend.
__label__4	"We booked this trip as luxury getaway with my mother and my wife.  We used VRBO.com to book the stay and picked 11 North as our destination.  The property is very nice, but the surrounding area is industrial.  When we arrived we where disappointed because of the area.  When we contacted Stay Alfred they where very helpful and helped move us to a better area.  While I am not a big fan of 11 North, I am a big fan of Stay Alfred.
Thanks"
__label__4	My old silver beetle limped in the other morning with no apt.  They checked it out almost immediately and called me back with an estimate.  Although I decided to not go ahead and fix and opting for a new car, I just wanted to say Thank You for the care and concern I got here.  I will be taking my new car there for servicing!! Very helpful and friendly service.
__label__4	"Updated my rating from 5 stars to 4 because my nail dip did not last very long. Within 4 days there were visible cracks and by the end of 1 week I had to soak off the dip powder because they started chipping off 
Rosie did a wonderful nail dipping powder on my nails and a very nice polish change on my toes. The spa is very clean and they pay attention to"
__label__4	Always good for a good meal. Their portion sizes are huge and can easily be split between two people so you can save a bit of room for dessert. Their Ghiradelli chocolate cheesecake and pumpkin cheesecake (seasonal) are my favorite.
__label__4	"So excited that there is a decent seafood place in Hermitage.

We've been there a couple times and love it. It's a little pricey for the area, but not for what you are getting. We usually spend about $30-$40 per person.

It's messy, but that's part of the experience. Reminds me of clam bakes and digging into whole lobsters in Boston. 

I've never had an issue with the service, but we tend to go at weird times outside standard rush hours."
__label__4	"Coming from CA, where nothing has yet to top Porto's Cuban bakery, Tatas proved itself to me.  The food is awesome and authentic. I had a chicken dish (can't remember the name but it has chicken, onions, and peppers) that was SO flavorful. I found it a bit salty, but I was definitely looking for more when I finished.  

I do think they're a bit pricey, but I find that to be the case with most Indy ethnic food restaurants. I would definitely reccomend it for some good Cuban cuisine"
__label__4	"This place is great in comparison to other local Thai places. We are regulars here and the service is great.
Been going here a while and they know what we order and start right when we walk in the door.
A fave for sure."
__label__4	"My husband and I had drinks with dear friends at the bar/lounge over the Thanksgiving Holiday. They were visiting the area from the South and were staying in the hotel. Very nice! While they were out of stock of the original bottle of champagne we ordered, we settled on another. We had great laughs and enjoyed catching up while warming up next to the fire place! Hopefully I will get to check out the guest rooms in the near future on a Philly ""stay-cation""!"
__label__4	3.5 stars. I had the chicken and waffles and they were solid but not as good or as flavorful as other places I have been in the US. That may not be their main dish, though. I will be going back to try something else on the menu. I also had their deep-fried brownie sundae which was really rich and tasted great overall. You can taste the calories in each bite but it's worth it.
__label__4	"My kids love Red Robin and why shouldn't they? They offer a large variety of kids meals. They even offer endless Mac and cheese. Talk about a good deal for those Mac and cheese lovers. 

Let's talk about the burgers because after all, this is a burger place. Their burgers  are quite tasty! I have tried quite a few of them. The new Tavern Burger with their famous camp fire sauce is delicious! 

My only complaint is the balloon  pump. It is so loud and we sat one table next to it. They should consider moving it."
__label__4	"My wife and I went to Foundation Room for dinner last night. 

The service was great. Our server Brandi was very attentive to us. 

The food came out in a good amount of time and cooked well. We did not feel rushed at all. 

The atmosphere of the restaurant was really cool. It's connected to House of Blue but more upscale than you would imagine for HoB. 

I would highly recommend this restaurant and would go back on future trips to NOLA."
__label__4	Good place to drink all day and they have roadies. Nice space, comfortable bar. Staff is good no problems. Go and get your drink on.
__label__4	Cute little place with great views of broadway. Very clean and great service. Cocktails were delicious and I was impressed with their wine selection as well. For food, get those dang tater tots. They are unbelievable! Skip the fried green tomatoes, honestly... those were the worst my husband and I have ever had. We are from the south, so we eat a lot of fried green tomatoes. We split the chili for our entree, which was very good!
__label__4	Nice spot with a mixed age group. We were there for the Halloween party with a DJ & lots of great costumes.. we had a great time. A little more over priced then some of the other bars in the area but you're paying for the atmosphere as well.
__label__4	This is a very nice establishment. The rooms are spacious with updated amenities.  The beds are comfortable and  well kept. The staff at the concierge desk was very friendly. The gym and pool areas were also very clean. They even have courtesy headstones in the gym for guest in the gym incase you forgot yours which is a nice added touch. The breakfast in the morning was very good with a wide selection of items to chose from some of which are made to order. I will defiantly consider staying here again.
__label__4	My mom had come to Maridadi before so I decided to go when I needed a bridesmaid dress altered -- I was seen right away without an appointment on a Saturday morning to get fitted. I was in and out in about 25 minutes. I got a 10% discount also because my bride went there which was nice. It is a tad pricey for alterations, but they did an awesome job and the dress fit me perfectly when I came to pick it up 3 weeks later. I will definitely be back for future alterations!
__label__4	Pretty spacious bar.  They have an awesome $1.50 lunch special with a decent selection.  You can play pool, use the jukebox, play arcade games, and enjoy a good beer.  They offer some craft beers on top of the usual American fare.  Right next to Westbrook bowling alley, so on Monday you can enjoy beers and food then go play dollar bowling!
__label__4	"Generally, always pleased with the service here. Always incredibly friendly. 

Careful, though, don't over salt my Salted Caramel Mocha frappucino. Too much makes it sink to the bottom and can get overwhelming. 

I wish this were a larger Starbuck's but they are clearly doing something right as this place is ALWAYS packed."
__label__4	It was good, it wasn't expensive, the portions were good value and the place was nice and cool. far enough away from the strip to make enjoyable but not a haul away. right by the Ryman auditorium. If you go to the mother church then you should go to Pucketts. Place scores an extra star for having a cheerful helpful server. Lyndsey I think. Next time I'm down there i will for sure return
__label__4	Started off with a selection of fresh bread and olive tapenade- delicious.  Ordered a Caesar salad to share - nice spice and great dressing.  Shared the chicken Marsala with my daughter - served on mashed potatoes with mushrooms in a delicate Marsala sauce.  Took a chocolate cannoli to go!
__label__4	The customs service isn't the greatest but the salt and pepper baked wings are super popular. I also love the beef chow fun with gravy sauce.
__label__4	"Typical Chinese buffet with the normal selections but the taste is better compare to the ones around the area. Food is always served warm and/or hot. Sushi selections are limited but fresh and changes just about daily so it's not the same old same old. Place is kept clean and spacious. Services is friendly and quick. 

Only negatives will be the crazy people that comes for the crab legs, you even think about walking by or glancing at the crab legs and you'll get trampled over."
__label__4	It's a pretty good skewer place! The flavors are good and the lamb skewers are especially flavorful. We made a mistake and made everything medium spicy, which over the course of 10+ skewers became quite hot. We thankfully ordered a jar of soy milk which was made in house and refreshing. Definitely recommend the lamb skewers, the bun and the cauliflower. The only thing I would not recommend is the potato as it was soggy, not crisp.  I would go back!
__label__4	Really cool way to make ice cream-mesh up the toppings into the liquid, roll it out until it solidifies, then roll them.  Had a great time watching.  Got the chocolate and banana pudding. Ice cream was ok but experience overall was really great.
__label__4	Great cocktail spot. Go here to be thoroughly impressed by their mixologists. After a few days of crappy too-sweet drinks, this place is a hidden gem among the less-than-stellar establishments on Boubon Street.
__label__4	This little hole in the wall is perfect for a solid breakfast sandwich or burrito. I got the breakfast burger with veggie sausage and spicy mustard. It was so yummy! Was stoked that they had a vegetarian option.  The random Star Wars decor randomly placed on top of framed paintings was a nice light hearted touch and a reminder to never take yourself too serious;) I got an iced chai and liked it but would recommend getting the chai warm instead. Ps they do have lunch items as well but I didn't check out that side of the menu.
__label__4	Great food with vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free options however; needs to be indicated on the menu. The soups are amazing! Awesome atmosphere too. The staff could use some help. They also own Thai Samuri in Trinity, FL. Hoping they update that location.
__label__4	I came across this mall driving around the NOLA area so i decided to check this mall out. This mall was packed and so was parking lots. Anyways the inside of the mall has a great variety of stores like the apple store, forever 21, aldo, gap, etc. I will defenitley return.
__label__4	Mojitos were nice, it's closed on Wednesday night super sad. Loving this place so accommodating all the stools have upholstery's and petty floral patterns. No bourbon but on bourbon st. Staff was nice,  good lighting red but not too red, good shade too. They also play Judge Judy if you need a little tv time, no drama. It also smells refreshing the further you get from the bar towards the left. Crisp clean refreshing Miller light, doesn't taste fruity like good friends. The have cost hangers too which v convenient.
__label__4	The deluxe burger was so good! Between the bacon marmalade and the generously sized patty, it was worth every penny. The draft beer section is fantastic as well! There were a lot of reputable breweries on the list making this location a must.
__label__4	Discovered this place for lunch today. Very good tasting food. If you're looking for good Indian food, look no further.
__label__4	"Came here for some fried chicken and we got some really good fried chicken. 

My friends I got here before 12 on a Sunday and there was no wait. We were seated right away in what looked like a side room. 

The deep fried chicken is crispy and flavorful. But towards the end my friends and I found it a bit salty. In addition to the chicken we got corn bread and mac and cheese. Corn bread is solid, mac and cheese was average. 

Service is friendly and attentive!"
__label__4	Love this place. Had a big dinner for my husbands birthday party and drinks and meals were really good. Service was great too.
__label__4	A week later with my pink and white nails,  there is no lifting on the edges and they are still in good shape.  but I go tanning everyday and the nails have taken on a yellow twinge i may go in to see if they can rebuff  them see if that will take away the yellow
__label__4	Great pizza, great design, really great place that is making Santa Barbara really on point.
__label__4	Great food, especially the French fries. Good beer selection for dine in or take out. Excellent service.
__label__4	Cocktails were awesome. Guacamole was a little bit on the smaller size, but still good regardless. I was loving the ambiance of the restaurant. Definitely somewhere I would go more often if I lived here in Indy.
__label__4	Everything was delish!  The caramelized pear salad was the best.  I prefer when Mac & cheese is thicker but it was ok and the collard greens with bacon were yummy.  The pulled pork sliders were really good.  If I lived closer I'd return.
__label__4	Got a half cheese & half pepperoni large (huge) and garlic parm wings. Service was quick and friendly. The pizza was excellent, not greasy, perfect ratio of cheese & sauce. The wings were fantastic, surprisingly super crispy!  We live close by and plan to make this a go to pizza spot. Only complaint, they don't deliver.
__label__4	We went for lunch last week and were pleased with the service, ambiance and food.  We tried the sashimi box and the tempura/chicken box.  While service was a little slow considering the number of customers, we enjoyed this pace.  We will go for dinner next time and hopefully this will be our new 'Go To' japanese restaurant.  Maybe we can give them a 5th star.
__label__4	Always enjoyable, clean and quick service. Good portions as well chicken katsu and coconut shrimp is great, and love their rice and mac salad!! Feel as if the prices are fair and is in a  great location.
__label__4	"Nice hot masala dosa filled w/ spicy potato & spices. A curry and a coconut sauce to dunk. Didnt even miss meat when the flavors are this vibrant. Surprisingly filling too for $8

Id get again. Took me a while to try this spot out and i will say the pics are understating. Its good."
__label__4	"This used to be Chong's Garden Chinese restaurant for years 7 years - so for nostalgia alone, I am glad to see a nice, new coffee spot (actually it's been here for a while).  I was a ""Bucks County Coffee"" and appears to be a Saxby's now.  

Anyhow - decent coffee drinks and a great central d-town location."
__label__4	Great food.  Cold beer. Brain freeze margaritas. Steaks so much better then Outback. Peanuts to consume and shells on their floor. Wednesday gem is 2 for 1 fajitas. Wait staff busy but attentive. Large parking area in a shopping center.
__label__4	New favorite taco place! Fresh, simple, and delicious! Make sure if you go to sit down you're ready for a wait on weekends... not much room to stand if you are waiting.
__label__4	"I've been in and out of here more than half a dozen times.

Service has always been helpful, clerks friendly and knowledgeable, checkout a breeze.

And you can join the Pals Rewards Club. This early in the game, I'm not quite sure what that gives me, but I signed up nonetheless.

I've never NOT found something I needed: food, toys, collars, nametags.

And if I'm every wandering around looking lost, somebody always offers to help me . . . and then, actually CAN help me."
__label__4	If you're craving for some good home Indian curry check out this place. I had the buffet there. Got some good selections . By far the best butter chicken around the area. Overall, they had 5 different curry and naan to go along with it. Definitely will be back. Don't forget to try the mango lassi drink.
__label__4	Food was good, we ate outside in the heat because the inside was freezing. Overall I would say you're paying for the atmosphere over the quality of the food. Service was sub par, probably makes for a better bar than restaurant.
__label__4	Have the chipotle shrimp salad and stop by the salsa bar to add mango salsa! One of the few chain restaurants that I frequent in Tucson. Crowded at lunch time and parking is ridiculously tight, but worth it.
__label__4	This place is great! Centrally located to the grocery store and liquor store yet very close to the airport.  4 stars only because of no shuttle to the beaches. Publix is across the street and Panera is right next door.  The hotel does offer shuttles to local businesses that are close by, and you have to arrange it in advance.
__label__4	I enjoyed how my eyebrows came out. Dee was very friendly and the whole thing was quick and painless. Convenient and plenty of parking. It was $15 for brows.
__label__4	Went for lunch before a Saints game and was seated quickly. We had great service. The menu was easy to navigate and had plenty of choices for our large party. I would definitely recommend the Fried Green Tomatoe BLT
__label__4	Great family shop and they specialize in vintage cars and late models. Service is excellent and prices are very reasonable. You should see some oldies but goodies parked in front of the shop.
__label__4	Most people are like oh it's just another cupcake spot but if you've never tried them then you wont understand that they offer flavors that most places dont carry. Sweet Potato which is my personal favorite, red velvet and coconut to name a few... these cupcakes are full of flavor and so moist PLUS its not icing overload....This place is reeking havoc on my healthy lifestyle but its ok, I'll enjoy them in moderation and at 3.00 each, I'm not breaking the bank.
__label__4	What a great idea! My girlfriend and I came here the other morning for breakfast before taking a trip to Ventura and we were left dazzled! delicious in a unique way, healthy and filling might I add!  We even got the kid size(The smallest option). Without a doubt we will be returning!
__label__4	I really enjoyed the food and the service. It took about a half an hour to get a table not too bad for a Saturday night
__label__4	I consider this neighborhood to be Glendale more than Broad Ripple. Anyhoo, stumbled upon Menchie's after shopping next door at Macy's. It was a pleasant surprise. Since this was our first time, the staff was great in explaining how the DIY process worked. The selection of fro yo and toppings were a nice variety.  The shop was bright and clean. Nice treat after shopping.
__label__4	First time at top golf and it was quiet the experience! Was visiting from buffalo with a group of friends and it was down pouring so we decided to come to top golf. It was so much fun! You don't have to be a pro to be good at the golf games they have too. We ordered drinks and food and they were amazing!!! Staff was also supper friendly and very helpful and wait time for food wasn't bad either. Can't wait to come back!
__label__4	"Finley's is a classic pub eatery. It's very spacious and accommodating. I eat here with my coworkers one Tuesday a month because they have inexpensive meal items with a great quality. The average meal is 12$

My Italian sub was fresh tasting and full. I should've taken a side angle profile because it could barely fit into my mouth. Everyone at my table enjoyed their food and we try to eat something different every time. 

They have a good selection of beer and specials daily. The restaurant is clean and offers outdoor seating."
__label__4	Prompt service, good food, reasonable prices, attentive workers...for my first experience I was quite pleased.
__label__4	Have been going for years. Family is fourth generation starting on the railroad in good old Sparks.  Last year was the first year we got a table in the vip section. So worth the money, it is usually very hot so the tables with umbrellas are nice. Also we went the very last day at the end. It is pretty empty and the food is still great!
__label__4	A good, quick lunch. We had soup and half sandwich. It was nice to be able to sit with our dog on the patio. The patio and restaurant/bar area did smell of old alcohol/beer. Not something you want to smell while you are eating.
__label__4	Did a weekend get away with my family here. Had a great time. All the folks we met were great with good food in the restaurants and making up of our room. No complaints.
__label__4	I've been to Fat Dan's a few times and they never seem to disappoint! This past weekend I tried the their wings!! Omg super yum. My husband loves the ghost burger. The tater tots are amazballs. I love good bar food and Fat Dan's is yum!
__label__4	"This was the first of 2 Hampton inns we stayed at during a weekend trip to Indy. This one we liked very much. 

Check in staff was very friendly and helpful. Even let me swap out the complimentary swedish fish for M&Ms. 

Room was very good size. Plenty of extra room to move around. And a beautiful view of a big lake and open field. 

Bed was very comfortable, and the shower was up to date and working 100%. 

A great stay and will stay there again with no issue."
__label__4	"This place was great!!! I love how they offer baked falafel. However, their pitas were definitely not homemade like they claimed to be. It's a good alternative if you can't make it to Mama's (hell, the cashier even said the owner goes to Mama's!!).
All in all, good falafel."
__label__4	Lots of craft beers to choose from in The Hill.  They also have a good happy hour deals which is when I generally stop in.
__label__4	Probably the best take out place in Phoenixville. But that is not to say the dine in experience isn't pleasant as well. Your typical go to Thai dishes (pad Thai, drunken noodles, is pad se ew) are always good and quick to order (usually ready in 15 minutes from call) and the small ~45 seat dining area is comfortable and charmingly decorated. They also have the friendliest staff I ever met.
__label__4	I like thé Rice bowl there, having ordered Una Don .  lunch set is a good deal. It would be bette if both miso soup and green salad are included in the meal set!
__label__4	Interesting menu. Was in Nashville for our anniversary and this place was recommended to us by a friend. We were not disappointed. Our server was amazing. The roasted cauliflowers were amazing and highlight of our meal.i ordered the cobia and my husband got the steak. Both were very well prepared and flavorful. Servers are professional and accommodating.  Very nice decor.
__label__4	Wait was ok, can park in the parkade without issue. Service was good and the food tasted fine, breakfast was what we were there for.
__label__4	"Garlic knots are amazing. The 18"" inch pizza was enough to feed a at least 5 people. The dave's pizza was simple, yet tasty. Great beer selection as well."
__label__4	A must when visiting NOLA, it is where locals go for great food. Must try the onion rings, huge, any of the parmesan dishes, chicken is great, trout almondin is terrific on the menu forever,  all fried seafood is perfect. Ice cold beer. You will get a kick out of the true local staff.
__label__4	Three words. Dan Dan noodles. I'm so glad this place finally made its way into south Jersey. Very clean, friendly staff, amazing food. What more do you need?  The wonton soup is also one of the best I've had and if you're into it definitely try the pork belly appetizer.
__label__4	"Ordered dbl cheese burger, chocolate shake and French fried cauliflower. Good choice!  The carhop said 'you can get fries anywhere, so try the cauliflower '. Glad I did. 
Burger was good. Moist bug not greasy. A bit much on the onion, but big whoop.

Ya gotta try it. Worth the trip."
__label__4	Good brewery!  The Belgian beers are outstanding.  The lagers are ok.  This is a fairly large brewery so I missed the atmosphere of many microbreweries.  But it was fun, and I look forward to returning.
__label__4	Just a great little place. Traveling and didn't realize the time change. Called about 10 minutes after they closed but I thought I had 50 minutes till then. Phone rang and rang then an Asian gentleman answered. I asked about take out and he took my order. Could have turned me away but didn't. Little did I know it was the owner. He was there all by himself waiting on me. My new fav in Boise. Yelpers said the house noodles was bomb. I agree. I can't wait till my next visit and check in and get my free homemade egg roll.
__label__4	The cosmos?! Ah-mazing. Food was fantastic, service was a little slow - would love to go back again when I have more time to enjoy!
__label__4	It's been a while since I've been to a Waffle House and was pleasantly surprised. It was clean, quiet and just comfortable. My waitress was attentive and courteous. The cook stopped to ask if my food prepared to my liking and taste. I think I'll be back.
__label__4	1pm $5 guided tour. Small place, stuffy with all the people. Horrific medical history told in an interesting way with bits of humor to tone down the macab. During our tour, guide was fair and aware of explaing sone culture context IN history WITHOUT politics. He tells you ALOT in about an hour. Some of it actually stuck. Great contrast to some of the other NOLA guides stuttering or making up stories on their walks. One of the best tours I've had at any price point. Don't forget to take a look upstairs.
__label__4	Great breakfast for a good price. I'll try the chicken fried next time.  Ham Steak and eggs was great. Maybe Mexican breakfast tomorrow.
__label__4	Great guava & cream cheese pastry!  Cafe Con Leche was good if you're in the mood for a sweet coffee.  The service was prompt and very nice.
__label__4	"Yummm! Best little lunch shop just down the street from our home, the pretzels and McZwick Sandwich are our go to lunch. The Pea and Dill Potatoe salad are the perfect little side. And the craft sodas are the cherry on top! 

It's very tiny and quaint so not much seating or places to snack, which would be itthe only downfall."
__label__4	They have really improved their menu and have sone really good dishes. It has been a great place to get Togo food during quarantine
__label__4	I'm so glad this place is in Metairie and not in the city... or else I'd weigh more then I do already! Everytime I stop by, I want everything. Everything is sooooo delish, you can't go wrong.
__label__4	"A small bar and restaurant with a bit of a local/dive bar type feel, but the servers/bartender and guests were super-welcoming and in a very short period of time we felt like we belonged and (if we only lived here) this would become a regular spot. There was a brief moment of hilarity when my girlfriend was caught peeking at some art in the bathroom and this only added to our sense of belonging.  

If the thought of a small local joint is a turn on rather than a turn off, I highly recommend checking out Pete & Shorty's."
__label__4	I love this place! Delicious food, friendly staff, and speedy delivery-what else could you ask for?!
__label__4	I had a couple of friends in town visiting and they are pretty picky eaters but from what I've heard about the place, I had no problem bringing them there so we could try it out.  I loved the selection, not the typical bar and grill menu.  Great drink specials as well.  I will definitely visit this establishment again.
__label__4	Voglia di Cupcakes ? Assolutamente Gigi's Cupcakes. I cupcakes sono buonossimi, anche se tirarli fuori dalla scatola puo affermarsi un po' complicato se non hai intenzione di sporcarti le mani di glassa, e il prezzo è un po' alto, per 6 cupcakes ho speso 25$. Ma nel resto è fantastico, da provare assolutamente lo stuffed cake, è incredibile.
__label__4	I've been here a few times, always on someone else's dime. There is a nice, wide selection of beers, ciders, and mixed drinks. I believe the drink menu is updated daily. In the summertime, there is a pleasant patio that has seats. The food is rather gourmet, although at ever party I've attended there, they have been a bit too sparing with it. (Maybe, my hosts simply didn't order enough, but it has been a consistent issue.) Always a pleasant place to be, and usually not too loud.
__label__4	"Love the ice cream but everyone I know hates the food and I'm not brave enough to try it. 

Back to the ice cream, don't come in here looking for typical flavors because you'll disappoint yourself into not trying anything. My favorite is the Maria cookie, the rose is strange at first but very delightful. Among others you'll find avocado, pineapple, mango, strawberry cheesecake, bubble gum, marzipan, abuelitas hot chocolate."
__label__4	"I can't believe I have never reviewed this place!

No trip to mid city is complete without a trip to Parkway.  In my opinion, they make some of the most perfect po boys in the city.  Whenever I go, I usually get a shrimp po boy, fully dressed.

I usually eat at the bar, when I go, because I find the service to be faster.  Or, I will order at the bar and take my food outside when I get it.

Also a great place to get a good poboy, a beer, and watch the game."
__label__4	My family and I went here for lunch today. The food was pretty good but nothing special. We had sushi and the beef with peppers lunch special. It took awhile for the food to come out and there seemed to be a lot of confusion about which sushi roles we ordered. I did however like that each lunch came with a spring role and clear soup. It was a nice added touch. I've definitely had better sushi but I think it was overall a good deal for what you were spending.
__label__4	You want fast Mexican? Look no further. These guys and gals are always on it, taking orders quickly and getting out even faster. They keep the chips and salsa flowing and are a fun group. I've never been disappointed with an experience and love stopping in for a quick, delicious meal.
__label__4	The pizza is on point.  Probably my favorite in the area.  Avoid the white chicken chili.  $8 for a bowl of bland mush.  Service can be hit or miss.  You can carry out if you don't have the time for a sit down.  I don't drink much beer but the mister is always happy with their microbrews.
__label__4	The Dog of Nashville has the best Chicago Hot Dogs i've had anywhere in Nashville.
__label__4	This place is amazing.  I've been here 2 Sundays in a row.  They recently just changed the menu.  Everything here is good.  Everyone I bring lives it.  I've had the buffalo shrimp tacos and the fish (mahi mahi) tacos.  My sons had the chicken tenders and fries this time.  Last visit he had the california burger, both times his plate was empty.  The fish and chips are good as well.  They serve it with a spicy tartar sauce.  The lemonade is fresh and has free refills.  You got to try it at least once.
__label__4	Love, love this restaurant. Good thai food and quick service. Had the thai basil fried rice lunch special, medium spice level, and it was so yummy. The soup that comes with the lunch special is good, too.
__label__4	I have been to and ridden up the Arch several times, but wife had never been so while in the area I took her there. Directly around the Arch is under major construction currently and isn't expected to be done until mid 2018. The Arch is cool to see, definitely a touristy must see while in St.Louis. My wife is glad she can mark it off of her list of things to see.
__label__4	"Tried this spot for the first time today.
I was a little worried walking up to a window for BBQ at a train station.
I didnt see a smoker, couldnt smell a smoker, the allure of BBQ was no where to be found.
I ordered online and picked up since thats the new normal.
The Brisket sandwich was full of smoked flavor, the fries were seasoned well and stayed crispy during the ride home.
I will be trying this place again its nice to see a small truck finding a way to survive."
__label__4	I was under the impression this place was mainly a coffee shop. But I had a pretty tasty soup and sandwich dinner here tonight!
__label__4	"Food: very good
Atmosphere: very nice
Menu: good variety 

Service: slow, especially when we were only one of 2 tables seated in the entire restaurant.

Overall: I'd go again, but it's a solid ""meh"" for the experience."
__label__4	Stopped in with friends mid afternoon and enjoyed great service without anyone hovering around.  We talked and laughed, got refills often and easily - even the super cook came out to talk to us!  Onion soup was terrific!  We will go back again to linger and chat, and not worry about being rushed out...
__label__4	"AWESOME breakfast/brunch place.
SUPER busy...better to waitlist and come back. The food is worth the wait. Any of their Egg Benedict is DELISH !!!
Took one star away because of the wait time. It is a very popular spot."
__label__4	my girls bark with glee when we enter the park.  so excited to see their friends and play.    great place to network as well.     love this place.    you can bathe your dog, you can play ball, sit on the benches, walk the track, they can play in the pools, the sand, or the grass.   lots of shade, and very enjoyable
__label__4	Excellent food. Some portions were a little small but it was reasonably priced. Scallops with risotto were done to perfection. BYOB, which I always like. Creme brulee was delicious.
__label__4	I definitely want to get a really good bike from here one day but for now this location has my no sugar electrolytes. I don't know who else sells my sugar-free electrolytes. This discovery is amazing because I get dehydrated during my runs and Powerade which was my runners drink of choice still was loaded with sugar.
__label__4	Quick service. Excellent fried fish. Had both the grouper nuggets and fish and chips. They came out fast and tasty.
__label__4	We ate here with my kids and it was surprisingly good! The food was tasty, it was served hot and we didn't have to wait to be seated. I liked the food, but their drinks were small and very expensive for what you received. The location is good and I'd recommend this place, but I'd recommend going elsewhere for drinks.
__label__4	I go here frequently for gel manicures and pedicures! The service is friendly, and they do a good job for the price.  The chairs are comfy and the salon is clean.
__label__4	"Excellent bikes but unfortunately no one was there when we came in, so we used a place next door.

-The owner noticed my first review and replied....that earns a star in my book. I can't wait to give this company a spin."
__label__4	Big Gay Ice Cream is such a cute place in Philly and I would definitely recommend. A lot of creative sundaes and reasonably priced. My absolute favorite is the Bea Arthur, it's absolutely wonderful!
__label__4	I like the black and blue salad. I like the salmon on cedar plank as well.
__label__4	"I ate here for breakfast and had B&G, sausage, eggs and home-fries. Their breakfast is a great cure for a hangover. They made the home-fries crispy just the way I like them. The home-fries were a cross between hash-browns and whole potatoes. Its hard to find a place that serve breakfast potatoes like that. 

This place is a great 1950s greasy spoon diner with a gorgeous looking wait staff.  Don't expect anything but classic greasy spoon and big portions. This is your locals only family establishment."
__label__4	Please delete accidentally posted review under wrong business.
__label__4	Four stars for the excellent service!! Honestly ice cream was okay. The base was solid but the cookie part reminded me of a quest bar like texture. I would probs try again but maybe for their scoops versus a sandwich
__label__4	You know this place is probably good because any nice summer night there is a line, but it moves pretty quickly usually.  Its priced decently and the serving size is good.  They have a variety of items, which was nice.  They had good service. The only reason I couldn't give it a 5 is because they don't have any seating.
__label__4	"Had the lunch buffet- probably the best one in St Louis
Great variety of dishes  Very tasty spicy and not the usual choices I could not  eat all the different ones   need to go back Food was fresh tasting and at hot temperature There was also fresh fruit and salad  I would have liked  better labels for the dishes  since I couldn't always recognize them  and I wish they had Kheer for dessert But definitely  a  very good restaurant  Will be back"
__label__4	"Friday night dinner with friends.  
This was my first time eating here. 
This place has a very nice laid back atmosphere.  
The clam chowder is some of the best I have ever had.  The fried catfish sandwich was nice and HUGE!  They had to kick us out as they close at 9:30 on Fridays.  I would definitely go back."
__label__4	I have been eating at this place since I was a kid! It consistently hits the mark and satisfies my cheese fries and cheese steak cravings.
__label__4	Maiden visit to Bistos. Great decor inside. We dined in at the bar and were greeted by a charming bartender named Heather. Heather was very personable and knowledgeable about the menu..and she mixes a great Margarita. We ordered enchiladas mixtape and the chili relleno. Both were scrumptious. Reasonably priced and will definitely return.
__label__4	"After a year of living in Philly I promised to break my Vegetarian fast only to eat at Genos Steaks because of the fame, and notoriety from the Boyz II Men MowtownPhilly video in the 1990's.  The service was kind, and the steak sandwich tasted like a steak sandwich.  It had Cheese, Steak, Beef and bread the end.

I felt good having gone to 9th street and Passyunk on a nice day.
The worker even let me take a photo of him after I asked."
__label__4	Clean and open.. bright.. helpful crew,  shelves are never bare.... never a line when i would go .. so that is a plus.. always some kind of deal.... good stuff there buddy
__label__4	"Superb margaritas, excellent food and very good service add up to make Rancho Rustico a place to come back to again and again.

The food is consistent and very good, portions are perfect, not overwhelming and never leaving you wanting more quantity.

Sometimes it can be a bit chilly inside, so bring a sweater.

My favorites are the Al Pastor Pork, the Carne Asada, and the Patron Margaritas. If you get there early, their Micheladas are fantastico.

The service is great too."
__label__4	Looking for a beautiful restaurant to impress your date?  Keep looking...  but if you're looking for authentic, fresh delicious Vietnamese food in a cozy local venue at an affordable place, check out Pho Cyclo Cafe.  An absolute mom and pop effort, service can be a bit on and off, but only because they are doing everything from taking orders and checks to preparing the food.  This area [below hipster East Passyunk] needs more venues like this.
__label__4	The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because this is my first time here and I'm only trying breakfast. I have to say that the corned beef hash is the best I've ever eaten. Also, the grits are perfect. The server was very nice. Great experience!
__label__4	"Bottomless wine on Tuesdays. 

Food is so good! Omg the cheese bread appetizer was hot and cheesy! It comes with marinara sauce and I could eat it all by myself! 

I tried the chicken and cheese sandwich on multigrain bread! Mouthwatering!!! Please try it! You will not be disappointed! The food was so good, and I was so hungry, so I don't have pictures of anything... womp"
__label__4	The veggie dog was wonderful. The openness was great. The Crawfish Etouffe' Fries were awesome. The team members were very friendly. My son said his turducken dog was delicious. And his wife enjoyed her beef dog. I will go back with for sure and bring friends with me. Welcome to your uptown home Dat Dog....
__label__4	Delicious bagels! We ate them so fast we couldn't get a picture. Bacon egg and cheese on an everything was delicious! My boyfriend got the pork roll egg and cheese that he loved too. We will be back to try out a bagel with cream cheese!
__label__4	"2 for breakfast. Good reasonably priced food. $3.99 special until 10 am. Waitress
Was busy but attentive. First visit, no complaints."
__label__4	We used to order from Mayflower all the time when we lived closer - now they don't deliver to our area and it is a big disappointment! Always fast and friendly delivery and the food was great - nothing better or worse than you expect. I have no complaints about Mayflower and love that you can order online.
__label__4	Tried the restaurant  last night . No one ate in the restaurant  only in the patio . Trued four of their salsa.  Mostly tasty but not hot . Guacamole  was plentiful.  Tried shrimp tacos . It was deep fried with mango salsa . Large portions  . Beef was tough.  Service was. Food average
__label__4	"Best seafood, and Cantonese cooking in town. I am usually a picky eater, but whenever I come here they always satisfy my taste buds.

Love the lobster scallion, the Peking duck, the garlic snails, the fresh boiled shrimp, the variety of seafood soup to choose from. Although the menu is mainly in Chinese, there is an American menu. If you want to try something different, just ask, they will recommend their best.

The main chef is awesome and I have been coming here for a very long time. Services are always friendly even if the language barrier is there."
__label__4	I am veganish and m boyfriend and I ate at the Wild Cow while we were driving through Nashville on a roadtrip. We shared the Banana-Peanut Butter smoothie. SO GOOD. He had the tacos and I had the Tempeh Veggie bowl over quinoa. The portions were generous and the tempeh was prepared perfectly. It was a cute little place and you could tell the owners and staff are truly environmentally conscious and run their business that way. I would go back for the smoothie alone.
__label__4	Dined in for brunch, on a Sunday morning. The service was solid. It's a nice space with bar and outdoor seating. The portobello sandwich was tasty. FYI, the fries are coated with flour to make them crispy.
__label__4	Always a solid time here. Prefer when the upstairs is open, but I'm sure they have their reasons. We stop here every time we visit and will continue to do so.
__label__4	We have eaten here several times before a show and always a group of six or more with a reservation.  It's not as fancy as some other steakhouses, but very comfortable even for a large group. In a way, that's part of it's charm! We are always greeted warmly and seated promptly and the service is always friendly and attentive. Add that to good food at a great price and you can't go wrong at this place!  Highly recommend.
__label__4	"Got a groupon for 5 classes from here--I like how they load all the classes onto a key chain card and all you have to remember is to bring your keys!  Very convenient.

I've been to Zumba twice now--I've definitely enjoyed it.  Can't wait to try their other classes!"
__label__4	Standing at the corner of Front & Girard, my friends made fun of me for yelping about Trax. I love my friends.
__label__4	I have always heard great things about HC Tavern and finally got to try  it for myself! I had the Killer Robots Black Acre beer which was refreshing for the summer and tried the smoked fried chicken entree. It was very delicious and juicy. I can't wait to go back to try more!
__label__4	Great experience on my first visit to this place. It is a very popular spot, very busy and very loud, and their reputation is well deserved. I had their flagship dish: Louisiana Cochon (suckling pig) and it was wonderful. Very tender and tasty meat, and the vegetables and apples that are part of the sauce make this dish a real winner. I'm looking forward to coming back and trying some of their other specialties.
__label__4	"Tons of breakfast and adult beverage offering on the menu.  Everything was good and came out quickly.

Shack-Offee $9 - Very adult, served with a stale glazed donut hole.
Why The French Hate Us $12 - Crispy hash brown on the side of this sandwich.
Merica $10 - Can't go wrong with these fluffy French toast topped with honey glaze mascarpone, strawberries and blueberries.

__label__4	I took a tour of Tower Place during an open house event. This was the first time I'd been in the building and didn't know what to expect since it was a state government office before being converted over to apartments. From the exterior, your eye is immediately drawn to the square windows that are spread far apart. But surprisingly, the windows are quite large and the apartments get plenty of natural light. The building also offers a great number of amenities and communal areas.
__label__4	"We have anxiously been awaiting the opening of Growlers.  The full menu will not roll out until next weekend, but they have a menu of small plates for the week.  I had the smoked salmon, and despite being a ""small plate"" found that it was quite enough for dinner.  The beer list is off to a good start, and I can see this place doing well.  Will need to come back for the full menu"
__label__4	"Etoufee fries? YES!

Drunk or not, these fries are BOMB! I crave this from time to time. Try their dogs or their fries or both! You can't go wrong. Plus, they have a bar and a super colorful interior. :)"
__label__4	A perfect spot to go to and enjoy lunch & drinks outside under the umbrella on a nice warm day :)
__label__4	Great tavern like atmosphere on South street. Sat near the bar and imbibed from the hefty beer list. Ordered the chorizo nachos and watched some basketball. Good spot to start off the night and get your mind in a jovial center.
__label__4	The food was ok. Had better vegan food. It did satisfy me enough to fill me up but wasn't drooling over my food like I do other vegan spots.
__label__4	Great as always but a large party came in, completely underdressed, loud and sat right behind us. I would think Sperrys would have some type of dress code???
__label__4	Came to Indy for work. Had one of my employees suggest this place. Food was in point. Rolls were fresh and delicious. Plenty of top shelf option with alcohol. Place was empty for lunch but have heard it get moving at night. Being from NYC I am always skeptical because my standards are high with sushi but they didn't disappoint at all. Definitely coming back on my next stop inside of Indy.
__label__4	I'll try an keep it short here. The staff was friendly and helpful with questions. The ambiance is modern and chic. The food was not only delicious and wholesome but also innovative. Try the nachos with the cashew queso, and the eggplant po boy. The tofu po boy and southern nuggets need some attention before I'll order them again. Over all the menu is modern and refreshing. Seed. Pure vegan. Pure goodness.
__label__4	As a first time person going there, I was new to the process. This certainly won't be my last time going. while there are some movies I would prefer seeing in IMAX, for your everyday regualr movie there is no better spot
__label__4	After last nights disappointing experience at Libertine this was a welcome surprise.   The Branzino really impressed me and I'm not a fish guy.   Also the atmosphere while a bit old school works now and will work forever.  Finally the price was just right.
__label__4	Food was okayyy, service was spectacular. The ambience really was calming. It's definitely a nice place and decent prices. The restaurant is gorgeous. Parking is hard to find, but overall nice place.
__label__4	Good food.   Noisy despite the attempt at adding sound dampening to the ceiling.
__label__4	We went for the specials. They were great I had the triple dipper. The kid had the chicken tenders kid meal and my friend had the 3 for $10. I hadn't been in a couple of years and I was very impressed. They have so many different specials. The food was tasty. Our server was nice and on point with checking on us. I will definitely be returning.
__label__4	This place doesn't disappoint, always service with a smile! The food is always amazing.
__label__4	Considering how few theatres there are in Center City, this one would be the obvious choice to go to. I would definitely not go here for a regular viewing ($12) but it was worth it for matinee ($9). It is one of the few that is reachable by subway so just that alone makes me give them 4 stars. :) I don't really care for a glitzy theatre so going to matinee was just the perfect low key movie experience. The seats were also quite comfy!
__label__4	"Surprisingly, for a place named ""Daddy Dawgs"", id have to say the hot dog (pretzel dog) was my least favorite. Very basic. The burger however was very good, they let you add up to 10 toppings which was pretty nice. All and all for a low cost fast food place not bad at all. 4 stars, would definitely try it out for lunch again sometime."
__label__4	really delicious traditional yemeni food! haneed was a bit different that what i'm used too but still delicious! lamb chops were cooked well but lacked seasoning. saltah and fahsah were great with the bread and the hilba adds nice flavor and health benefits!
__label__4	Usually find what I am looking for at a great price. Good clearance items and most of the time a good selection. :-)
__label__4	Hidden gem! We've come to Santa Claus Lane numerous times but never spotted the Garden Market. After looking online for a place to grab a healthy lunch on a Sunday, we stopped in for a salad. To our surprise, the food was fresh and tasty and the back garden was the perfect setting for a warm, sunny January afternoon.
__label__4	"An absolute Tampa hot spot. Super cool aesthetic, lively, and fun! Great for groups or date night, but expect to pay for the experience. I've ordered from a few of the vendors, including a 6-oz glass of $8 chardonnay (eeekkk), sweet and spicy sushi, and avocado toast. Lots of options for all! Free parking located in lots and on the street near the river. Looking forward to ""checking in"" again soon!"
__label__4	This is one of our favorite places to go for banh mi and for iced Vietnamese coffee. Prices are reasonable and the decor is inviting.  However, don't get the pad thai. For some odd reason they load it up with paprika, which doesn't belong in the dish. Everyone at our table agreed the pad thai was really bad. But oh, the banh mi!  served with the bread freshly toasted, still warm and crispy on the outside, the banh mi's the bomb!
__label__4	I've been going to Think Pink for quite  a while. All the nail technicians are very nice, the owner on the other hand is a different story. On more than one occasion including today, he has yelled at one of his employees  in front of customers in Chinese. Then when Thu left he was still mad. We were all just sitting there looking at him. I love my nail lady, but I don't know if I'm going back.  I should be there to relax not wait for him to go off.
__label__4	Great pizza. Even my picky eating daughter loved the pizza margarita. The truffle pizza is also excellent. We also had the Brussel sprouts for an appetizer. They were  delicious and enough to feed the entire table. No domestics but had really cold IPAs.
__label__4	Good work on shirts, jackets, and pants. A little pricy for basic services, but usually done quickly.
__label__4	Pretty good fusion cuisine.  I liked their beer selection the best though. They had Chimay Rouge a great Trappist Ale.  Valet parking. Nice artwork on wall. Great place for a date or business dinner.
__label__4	"Big Sky has something for everyone.  They have wonderful, fresh food and a great wine selection.

We took my parents to Big Sky and they really enjoyed it.  It is a great place to make a meal out of salads, appetizers or entrees.  Some people enjoy smaller portions and they are not pushy with ordering entrees.  Their menu is composed of classic dishes, as well as some little twists but nothing that will scare the older folks off.

I highly recommend this place for the quality of the food and service."
__label__4	"Found parking fast. 
No seating inside and just several seats outside. Outside = on the cold/rain in a slightly creepy street. We decided to eat in the car. Hey, we already paid for parking, right?

Sweetgreen does something to make salads taste so good. Happens every time.   Even when my salad is being prepared by a trainee who keeps asking for guidance. I go with either the kale Caesar or the lemon avocado something, adding kale. 

Good salad, worth the 20 minute drive, need more locations!"
__label__4	Fried yellowtail was great, black drum was tasty and good.  Ravioli had a metal after taste. Drinks were ok, average.
__label__4	"I've always passed this little place and wanted to try.  It did not disappoint -- large light crispy-edged Crepes were excellent. Service was also perfect.

Crepes for breakfast after our Christmas party were perfect.  Wife had strawberries and creme fraiche and I had onion, lamb sausage and cheese (Swiss I think).  

My wife's cappuccino was good but my coffee was a little weak. Would love to have had a nice French press, but didn't see that option."
__label__4	Always consistent, food is excellent, lots of choice, and the service is great. I really can't believe how inexpensive it is for what you get. There are a lot more items on the menu but the deep fried chicken tenders are the best I've had anywhere. They are moist and juicy on the inside and perfectly light and crispy outside, goes excellent with the house honey mustard dipping sauce.
__label__4	This place is awesome and it has an excellent playground for the kids.  I stopped by here for their BEST hot fudge sundae!  In my opinion, it's better than Dairy Queen.... Because of their hot fudge tastes better I think?!?!?
__label__4	Fantastic pizza for DE.  Wings are very good as well.  This is our go-to place for family pizza night!  They got Sarcone's bread for catering gigs as well which is a definite plus!
__label__4	"You get a free hug when you walk in the door. 
Organic food, lots of vegetarian, vegan and glutten free options.
Had the Vegan Falafel Wrap, it was huge and I had trouble finishing it before I got full.
Still managed to force myself to try a few desserts which were AWESOME. I don't believe they were truly vegan, they were too good.
Closed on Mondays."
__label__4	Cool Philly landmark. Def go see the actual bakery and not just the stand at Reading Terminal Market. It's fun to pick out pastries and definitely go for a cupcake. They're delicious. And the cakes are great too! Bought one for my Dad's birthday. It traveled great and tasted fantastic three days later!
__label__4	My family has been going to Cuneto House of Pasta for years.  WE are never disappointed in service or the delicious food.  They now are open on Sundays at 4 p.m.  So often we have wanted good Italian food on Sunday.  Now it is available.  Thanks Cunetto.
__label__4	The Bode is an older hotel been remade.  The younger crowd will like it a lot. There is no concierge. You get texted a code for your room and the doors have key pads.  The room was clean and simple.  Nothing super fancy but comfortable enough.  There is a gated courtyard and a bar/coffee shop on the premises and lots of space for hanging out and socializing.  The staff at the bar/cafe were very friendly.  I would stay again
__label__4	What a dive, but what a beer list!  Had lots of fun trying out some new beers on a super hot summer beer.  Atmosphere is awful, but after a couple of Belgian beers, you'll hardly notice.
__label__4	"Hush puppies were delicious, especially with a small side of honey to dip them in...

Catfish itself was acceptable, just slightly overcooked.  Service was a tad slow due to the after-church crowd...  Overall decent food and reasonable prices.  

Got the three piece fried catfish dinner and it was enough food."
__label__4	The waitstaff is amazing here.  I love taking my daughter here.  We always have a great experience.
__label__4	Great food ,great view, great service me and the wife had the oyster , mussels and the fish and shrimp tacos and all were very good jose our server was very attentive and helpfull if you wanat to be taken care of ask for JOSE. Great experience over all.
__label__4	Old school diner feel with awesome sandwiches.  It's easy to miss as you're driving by, but it's worth keeping an eye out for.
__label__4	I Really liked this place.The woman who cut my hair was wonderful.She had high energy and a bubbly positive personality.She could make the worst fowl mood turn into a good time.I liked my cut and so yes go ahead and book your next cut here.
__label__4	Seeing as it is the only Old Navy in the area it is my favorite! Old Navy puts on some great deals and you can often find cute work clothes. I love getting their leather sandals during the summer. They are just like the J.Crew ones but half the cost. They typically have quite a bit in stock which is great because you can order online and do an instore pick up. I usually prefer this since their lines can get reallllly long! Check them out!
__label__4	I have been here a few times and every time the wait is ridiculous.  The food is great though.  I know most people come here for the char grilled oysters but my favorite dish is the fried catfish.
__label__4	First off - this place is LOUD. It's pretty difficult to have a conversation here without yelling so brace yourself for that. Also, despite having a reservation we still waited another 15-20 minutes before we were seated. The staff was really kind though and took the time to check up on us and keep us updated on our table while we waited. They also brought us some free dessert! As for the food - I got the rigatoni which was really flavorful and also supplied my lunch the next day too!
__label__4	As a native, I know many great places downtown/FQ, but had lunch here for the first time. Great hole in the wall place for lunch if your downtown.  Definitely recommend and will be back to try their breakfast. Shrimp and merliton special was right on.
__label__4	Our first time here and all 4 of us enjoyed our meals. Their salsa/chips and homemade Guacamole was excellent.   I had Hawaiian fajita. My husband had beef tacos. My son had large burrito. His girlfriend had chicken fajitas. Everyone of us thought our meals were great. My passion margarita was strong but tasty. The service was fine. Everything came out accordingly.  We will definitely be back.
__label__4	"Customer service was excellent!  I ordered the chicken tenders; one mild, one medium, one hot and one extra hot. The cashier thankfully advised me against the XX hot:)
I love spicy food and the medium was hot enough to bring on the sweats.  
The flavors were bold and delicious."
__label__4	Cute little place to eat.  The margaritas are good. The food is good.  Expect to pay more than you're use to.  Prices are about $5 higher than other Mexican places. And the chips and salsa are NOT free .  I'll be back just because I like Mexican food and this was not bad.
__label__4	"Food was incredible, I especially loved the soup dumplings. Very cool atmosphere and vibe.
Knocking one star off (otherwise it would be a 5) due to the fact that we called and asked if we needed a reservation, and were told no because it was not busy. When we arrived 10 minutes later, we were told that there was a 45 minute wait. The hostess seemed annoyed to be dealing with us. But, the rest of the staff (including our server) were awesome and helpful."
__label__4	Delightful. Everything was quite good.  I would go back but live in Michigan.  Had the special pork belly Benedict.  The flavors melded together perfectly.  We were a party of nine.  Great service.  I can definitely recommend this location.   Everyone enjoyed their selection.
__label__4	Let's say you need to stay way under your per diem for a day for some odd reason.  And let's say that you are *done* with being away from home.  And you're staying in the French Quarter.  Where do you fill up on relatively inexpensive, hearty, home-style food?  This is a good choice.  Best basic red beans & rice I've had so far in New Orleans, and the serving is enough for two.  I didn't have problems with the people there, but I wasn't exactly in the mood for conversation anyways.
__label__4	First time having a poboys! And I'm very pleased at this establishment  got the fried shrimp poboy and I loved it! Went out to get one more sandwich before my flight. Told a lot of my friends about it, and hopefully will go again when I visit New Orleans.
__label__4	Hadn't been for years and had forgotten about it. A friend and I had the hot dogs, he with Chili which he loved, I with sauerkraut which was good, not great. Our other friends had a salmon salad and a Burger which were also very good.
__label__4	I visited Percy Street with a work event awhile back and I was impressed. The service was great and the food was very yummy. On top of that, I felt like the portions were super fair for the price and location of the restaurant. I would definitely go back!
__label__4	I'm from San Diego. If you know anything about San Diego you know about Filippi's pizza. Hands down the best pizza ever. Since we've moved to Arizona we have been looking for comparable pizza to no avail. Until now. Kudos Magpies Gourmet Pizza! So good. I would have given 5 stars, but the place is too small. Not really a good eat in restaurant.
__label__4	I love their crepes! I have only tried the ones with matcha green tea flavoring, but it's darn good. A little pricey to me, but it's very nice treat made by people who are pro's at making these crepes. I also like that they provide free iced water at the corner!
__label__4	Menu is a bit pricey, but affordable. Everything on the menu is worth the price in my opinion to eat once in awhile and a perfect place to celebrate a special occasion. I sat outside and it's such an amazing view. The ambiance of this place is incredible and on a real ship. I ordered the Philly roll and it was phenomenal. I had swordfish and it was so juicy, but the texture is different.
__label__4	Lavender Inn by the Sea is a cute boutique like hotel. The champagne on arrival is great and very festive. The wine, cheese and cookies were great snacks. The hotel is located walking distance to the beach or State Street so it was great to park and not move the car till we left. We didn't get a chance to take advantage of the bike rentals but next time. The only gripe Id say is the outdated walls paper, and the walls seem thin, we could hear the neighbors arguing through the wall but maybe that was bad luck. Otherwise everyone was friendly and we'd stay there again.
__label__4	Great chips and salsa. ..margaritas where great. ..Would highly recommend fuzzy's Taco shop
__label__4	My best friend took me here because he know's that I appreciate good and great food..... & man, he was right ! This is an hidden gem !  Some great comfort food ;  )
__label__4	"This place used to be a little bit better. I really miss shrimp and I would love to see some avocado. 

The place looked a little bit messy but overall I can't complain. My gf and I left this place full after spending $30. Little pricey but I will come back someday."
__label__4	Discovered Bagels Plus through a friend. Now its the ONLY place in the Metro Tampa Bay area that I will buy bagels and cream cheese. These bagel are very well prepared and some almost too big for a typical Bagel cutter. The other deli items are always fresh and great tasting. Love the latest creation of cream cheese -Honey Walnut-perfect for when you crave something sweet but not so sweet that your teeth ache.
__label__4	Go for the breakfast buffet or the ice cream sunday buffet.  We used to go on group dates here back in high school for a fun ice cream eating competition.  Always had a blast.  They don't like large groups however.  Breakfast buffet is the best in the valley.  After years of being away I tried it again and must say, it hasn't lost a step.  It's awesome.  Full selection of almost everything you could imagine and they even include juices for you.  You'll love it.
__label__4	A long line for coffee, but I see why. They have a great variety of hot and cold beverages. We got a chocolate croissant, but was given a cream filled. They quickly made right though. They have a nice outdoor area where you can sit and people watch the beach. Good spot for coffee for sure!
__label__4	"As a German, I can vouche - this is a traditional German restaurant. 

Great beer, authentic food and good vibe. Once a year I visit with the family as a Christmas get together. 

My go to is Kässespätzle and s a side of cucumber salad, yum! For meat eaters you know Schmitz has got it all.

Keep it up - lest go Germans ;-),
Pete"
__label__4	Good seafood restaurant.  Not as many choices as I expected, but the fish and chips made from fluke was light and very tasty.
__label__4	One of our favorite breakfast spots near our house. My husband loves their breakfast burrito and I'm a huge fan of the B&G's. The staff is always so welcoming, friendly and quick! Love that it is family owned and operated. The only complaint we have ever have is that it's freezing inside during the winter. It's pretty small and there isn't a waiting area so people will stand in the doorway with the door open. We just go when the weather is nice!
__label__4	I been here a couple times and always come for the crab legs. They are so good with the perfect spices. Good atmosphere but the service could be better. We normally have to wait close to 45 minutes for our food. The house margarita is very good and strong.
__label__4	Currently sitting at the bar and enjoying our drinks. The bartender Chris is really nice and knowledgable about the drinks they have. The restaurant is very clean and has a cool atmosphere as well.
__label__4	I was in the area so i wanted to give them a try. They make their own dough which was really good and they also use boars head deli meat. My sandwhich was filling and tasted great. Next time i need to try their pizza. I also had their iced coffee with alot of vanilla syrup and i still added alot of milk and classic syrup to add more of a milky taste. I guess I'm not a true coffee drinker lol.
__label__4	A great place to see music, have a drink and get some food.  The menu has a limited number of items.  I recommend the catfish and grits and the broccoli fritters. The beer selection was very good, including a good number of non-alcoholic brews (I was designated driver.).
__label__4	The pizza comes taste amazing but they're a little too expensive for how small they are. Cool concept and super friendly people, they were also featured in the news. I'd recommend to try it out, especially if you like trying new things
__label__4	The employees set this Starbucks apart. They are always very friendly and keep the establishment in top notch condition, which says a lot given all the traffic that passes through here.
__label__4	"Good pizza, good beer with some micro-brewery selections.  Meat and cheese plate was great too.  We had ""The Good Pie"" pizza, which was delicious.  It's not your typical pizza dripping in cheese, instead it's slices of Mozarella, a great sauce, on some awesome bread.  So it's slightly different, but very good and fresh."
__label__4	This is one of my favorite spots in Reno.  It's a classic old style steakhouse where they focus on the service and food rather than the latest interior decorating trends.  The waiters are first class and provide the kind of service you only find at a place where waiters work for years not months.  Ours personally checked the wine cellar when we discovered our wine vintage was off one year and even had a card to call him if we had trouble with valet.  They also include the traditional complimentary palette cleanser and chocolates to finish the meal.
__label__4	My son really enjoyed it here. The prices were reasonable and we went before the afternoon peak. My only minor complaint is that there are teenagers working the play areas and they just stand there. I found myself having to tell kids not to gather at the top of the large slides and not to climb up the slides the opposite way. The young lady was just standing there on her phone. I was uncomfortable because you never know how parents may respond when you're telling there kids what to do; right or wrong. Other than that, it's great place for indoor fun.
__label__4	Great food and alright service. We had the crab cake appetizer and Mardi Gras pasta, both were tasty. Waiter was friendly but didn't refill drinks in a timely manner. We were initially seated inside but asked to be re-seated in the back courtyard, which they were glad to do. Overall, we'd come back.
__label__4	Love Schnucks for their wide selection of flowers and gifts.  Great to pick up something for last minute gifts.  The flowers always look great and within anyones budget.  Great location and a cornerstone of the community.
__label__4	This is one of my fav pizza places.  I stopped ordering for awhile due to cold delivery or incorrect orders.  I decided to give them a try tonight and found that not only was my order early, it was hot and had a generous amount of toppings.  King Arthur Supreme is a gourmet meat lovers pizza with wonderful flavors.  The delivery lady was sweet and professional.  I will order from here again.
__label__4	I found out about this salon through yelp and I also requested Jack to do my haircut. What I like the most in here is that it is not pricey, plus they'll provide you a high quality service. I showed him a picture of the look that I wanna get and he totally did it to my hair -- he nailed it!
__label__4	Their soft drink selection is lacking but the food is out of this world phenomenal. Chicken Manchurian Bezul, omg.
__label__4	"My favorite dining experience other than home.
Best fried chicken, great southern food. You get as much food as you want. Wish there were some healthier options instead of all southern. 
Clean, fun, friendly, different. Loved meeting new people if I wanted and not having to meet them if I didn't. 
Great service. 
A bit pricy but I only get there when company comes in to town. 
Desserts could be way better."
__label__4	"The restaurant opened in Fenton about 9 months ago. This is the first time we've been in...

Highly recommend.
I got the pork steak---tender and falling off the bone. 
DH got the pulled pork--lovely!
DD got the barrel baked potato--the best!

The cole slaw is creamy and divine.
The fries are absolutely scrummy
Potato casserole was de-lish

Garlic bread--average"
__label__4	Tried this place on a Friday night. When we first arrived it was pretty busy but it died out pretty fast. To the point where we even asked what time they were closing because it seemed really empty for a Friday night. I had their red ale and it was quite delicious. I didn't try a flight because I was happy with my red. But my husband enjoyed trying a few different ones in a flight. It will be an excellent addition to the other breweries in the area even though it is a bit further away from the others.
__label__4	Amazing gelato! Lines out the door. My only complaint is that it's too small for the volume they constantly acquire. So you might have to just accept that you'll be eating and walking with your wondrous gelato. Which is fine, plus, there's always other locations that are larger than this!
__label__4	"Pro:  A quaint little caffeine sanctuary!  I ventured to this place after a visit to the Italian Market for a quick pick-me-up.  The ample selection of beverages is what you'd expect from most coffee shops.  However, this establishment's ambiance is the perfect mix of casual conversations, students buried in their laptops, coffee junkies like me. 

Con:  Just a tad bit small. 

Bottom Line:  I can go for a warm cup of happiness. Join me!"
__label__4	Food was fresh, high quality and very good. Prices aligned pretty well for quality of food. Drinks are a little on the pricey side, even for a higher end restaurant.
__label__4	They make guacamole table side and it's so fresh and delicious. The margaritas are some of the best around!
__label__4	Delicious food. Large shrimp in the shrimp fried rice. Excellent portions.  Great ap to order online. Absolutely order from there again.
__label__4	Straight legit chicken spot. I had the chicken tenders with fries and a side of red beans and rice! So yummy. Late night bar food or quick afternoon snack or lunch.  Highly recommend...chicken tenders are better than Popeyes. Just my opinion!
__label__4	BOMB.com. This place certainly lived up to our expectations. Willies has moved up to our #1 best fried chicken joint. If you're in New Orleans, it's definitely worth checking out. Fried chicken, mac n cheese, peas and corn bread were all super tasty. Juicy, flavorful chicken with the perfect crisp, melt in your mouth cornbread and super delicious Mac! I don't normally enjoy peas but these were great!
__label__4	"Only had cocktails at the bar but the food smelled very nice. I noticed empty plates at occupied tables and others in groups laughing, enjoying themselves. It was a nice atmosphere. Oftentimes airport restaurants/bars can appear quite sterile with travelers absorbed in their own spacial worlds. It's understandable of course. 
The climate here was busy, upbeat within attentive employees. Drinks, well as usual, they're a bit pricy and not free pours like you might see in airports such as New Orleans."
__label__4	Good pizza, Pricey pizza but good pizza. Nice crust and 3 different temps of hot wings. I'd eat there again, you get what you pay for.
__label__4	Great spot for a quick breakfast bite! Friendly servers (though that was the norm throughout NOLA!) and good variety for a small place. My friends all raved about their eggs, and I personally think their salads are some of the best I had in the city. If you're looking for a more extensive or upscale brunch spot, this might not be for you - but for a quality breakfast / lunch, it's ideal.
__label__4	"Glad to have tried this place. The enchalades were great. Hubby loved the lengua sopas. Loved the rice. Green salsa needed salt but was otherwise good. Everything that came out of the kitchen looked great. I want to try everything! 

And for the bonus. THEY DELIVER! I can't tell you how many times Ive said I wish we could get tacos delivered."
__label__4	All the food is really good, especially the spring salad. The chicken wrap was a little bland.
__label__4	Great food/ mostly small Tapas style plates with a nice selection of cocktails. Service was great as well. Hope to come back soon.
__label__4	Stayed in a hotel downtown for a night and walked around downtown on a beautiful Saturday morning. Great little coffee shop and a nice atmosphere.
__label__4	"My boyfriend and I went last night, (Monday)
a first time for both of us. Although it was not busy, the service was a little slow and the waitress/server seemed to be a little flighty but she was just as nice as she could be.  We had a good time, and will most likely visit again."
__label__4	Fun, hip spot to get lunch or dinner. Big on attitude and hot sauce variety! The wait staff were very focused on helping us, but the food was a bit on the ordinary side. Nonetheless, prices were quite reasonable be and we enjoyed ourselves. The tostada was fine and a large portion.
__label__4	We love Rosatis! The thin crust is our favorite. I think they need a bit more organization and zeal but their food is good!
__label__4	The only thing I did not like was the cold bread that was served that tasted like it had been there for days or more. Everything else was good. I got the sea bass dinner. For appetizer I got the crab cake. It was very good but I'm used to more crab in my crab cakes. For dessert I got the creme brûlée. My husband got steak, mashed potatoes, Mac n cheese. For dessert he got the Oreo key lime pie. He enjoyed everything he ate but felt he's had better steak from places like Ruth's Chris and Trulucks.
__label__4	We decided to try this restaurant because we were staying in the area and wanted to see the fish tank. Food was delicious. Everything we had was really good. Overall service wasn't bad but the one item that seems to keep me from giving 5 stars are the kids meals. $11.50 for chicken fingers and French fries or a grilled cheese sandwich is just so ridiculous to me! Even more then we have paid at Disney! Other than that, it was a good experience.
__label__4	"Chef came out personally to announce that there were no more tater tots. :( He offered cheesy fries or gravy fries, instead. When my homies asked for both, he not only obliged, there was da-bris roast beef on top! 

Chef went off-menu; gave me the best fries I've ever had!"
__label__4	Absolutely delicious!  Try the coconut soup (I am sure there is a longer fancier name, but it is fabulous !)
__label__4	We dined at Buddy's while visiting family in Tucson. We're from Houston, a total foodie city, and were very impressed with the food and service. The appetizers were fresh and flavorful and a few local beers were available on draft. My husband ordered the pot pie and loved it! My favorite thing was that you could tell things were made in-house...chicken strips, burger patties, dressings etc. no frozen/pre-made shortcuts here! We enjoyed our dinner with family and definitely recommend trying this place out!
__label__4	Out of a big chain they are pretty good carwash. Even if you get the $20 ultimate it's a good deal. They ah e recently installed new bug sprays before you get to the main wash. This place is always busy. I think my only complaint is they are starting to get too big for themselves and customer service has fallen.
__label__4	"Great service, great ambiance, great food.  The maiz de la rueda appetizer was delicious.  My husband had the carnicera and I had the seared tuna special.  The ""sandwiches"" are filled with meat and other ingredients.  I just didn't care for the spread on the tuna.  One of the herbs in it had a very strong and overpowering flavor.  For dessert we had the flan and it was excellent.  We definitely will return because there are many interesting menu items."
__label__4	"The food was very good , I usually go to 
Philli but I figure I try it and it was great and 
thats good coming from a true Korean ...
There a little too modern but it's a new era ."
__label__4	"Very good food and an ever better weekend breakfast. The wait staff is always excellent and the prices are very reasonable.

My only complaint is that the place gets loud when there is a large crowd present."
__label__4	This place man.  We went here to grab some food before a Cardinals game.  We sat outside and the atmosphere was electric.  Everyone was there to have a good time.  Anyway, the food.  The food was fantastic.  I got half a muffaleta, my husband got the jambalaya and we split an order of fried alligator.  Everything was amazing.  My husband's jambalaya was a little too spicy for me, but he loved it.  Everything was pretty cheap and we got out of there in plenty of time to walk to the stadium for the game.  We will definitely be going back.
__label__4	Went on vacation a few months back and a friend recommended this place. Had to say I loved the smoky pizza and was very please with the service I received from our waitress Sarah. Will definitely come back when I get the chance to come back to Boise.
__label__4	Excellent service had sliders very juicy and tasty.  Only down side my friend ordered a glass of wine and it fell over and broke. She hit it with her hand. They chargerd her for another glass. How strange is that. She onlky had one sip befir spilling. I thought they should have replaced it free.
__label__4	Great service, pad Thai, and drinks. The only two things I'm not a fan of are the mandatory valet parking and fried wonton appetizer.
__label__4	Cafe Latte is a nice little stop in the mall.  We tried a freezucino (frappe) and now we have to stop by every time we are in the mall.  They blow everyone else's away.  I have personally triede the caramel and the drizzle and they are both wonderful :)
__label__4	"I love Bernie's. Great food, ambiance is chill, I love the outdoor seating when the weather allows it. Never had a bad experience. The menu is fairly big so for a creature of habit like myself, I always get the same thing so I'm not going to sit here and claim ""everything is good"". It's worth a try, especially if you're in the area(Cheltenham/Abington). Nice steady crowd and plenty of tvs to enjoy sports. Niceee long beer list too"
__label__4	Great tacos!! Only thing was that they were a tad more greasy than normal street tacos, but overall very delicious and would go again!!
__label__4	Had an early dinner after work. Both my husband and I very much enjoyed our pasta, along with a 1/2L bottle of wine. There were only 2 other occupied tables at the time, but because it is small I would suggest reservations on the weekend or, like us, get there early :)
__label__4	"We travel with a pack who have a wide range of allergy issues, gluten, lactose, no spicy to name a few, lol. The cafe was more than happy to cater to all of them. The service was friendly and fast. Bonus points to being dog friendly,  as one of my girlfriends has her device gog with her.  

And last but not least... those biscuits? Yesss!"
__label__4	"Went for lunch at 11:30.  It wasn't too crowded and we were seated immediately.
The house salad was awesome, as usual.
The Chicken Stasili was excellent.
Service was also very good.

This has been my experience every time we've been to Bella Milano.  We've been there  a handful of times and have always enjoyed it."
__label__4	This place is good. A bit pricey, would imagine it's because they have a chef. But very nice atomosphere. Lovely staff
__label__4	"Surprisingly good!!

Their sushi was actually pretty excellent. We were quite surprised! They had one roll with lemon slices on top. You would think that would be good, but it was delicious. Tart and excellent. The ingredients were super fresh. The tuna was some of the best I've tasted!

Service was AWESOME. Not enough good things to say about that. 

The prices were high, which we knew going into it, and the seafood chowder was just okay.

There are better sushi places in the area, but this place hit the spot, and the location is cool."
__label__4	I was here for Phillies Spring Training. Never been to a Mellow Mushroom before and left pleasantly satisfied. A little bit of a wait, but that's why it's good to have a bar. If you're in the mood for pizza and you've never been here, there's enough choices to make you happy. Go for it.
__label__4	"Food and the service is great. Been living in SB for a while and never noticed this place because of its ""hidden"" location next to Casablanca. My wife and I agreed that our favorite part of our experience was the service. Servers were very kind and attentive. The restaurant was also very clean and had a great vibe.

We will definitely visit again!"
__label__4	The stroganoff was really tasty and the chicken pot pie looked amazing too! And the dessert was excellent-flourless chocolate cake with toasted marshmallow  topped with a scoop of peanut butter Capt. Crunch gelato! Friendly staff and loved the decor too! A bit pricy but we will be back!
__label__4	Maybe it's been a long time since I've seen a movie in theaters but wow..12 bucks to see a movie?  It seemed kinda steep to me.  Oh well, I really wanted to see this movie.  The chairs were comfy and rocked!  Maybe this concept isn't that new either...and I'm just old for the movie theater scene, but I thought that was pretty cool.  I'll probably come here again for a movie.  Luckily for me, I didn't see a movie that would attract most obnoxious teens.
__label__4	"11/23/2019...After a successful first experience, we hired Let's Get Moving for another move. This was a very large move with an excessive amount of boxes. It took Matt and a 6 man crew 7 hours. Every employee was polite, asked where things went and never complained (only after going up 23 stairs for the 100th time ).  Their pricing is competitive...you get what you pay for. I will pay a little more to keep my belongings in one piece. 

Thank you to Matt and his wonderful crew!!! May we never have to move again!!! Lol"
__label__4	Excellent service. The creaminest grits ever. I recommend the pork belly and fried green tomato sandwich the daily doughnuts, the beef hash and the pecan pie.
__label__4	I mostly buy the frozen tamales, and love how many vegan and vegetarian options there are, and that they are available in markets downtown!
__label__4	I've dealt with this company at the store, and there mobile trucks. One multiple occasions they've exceeded my expectations. Always professional and timely. Just a all around positive experience. Weather it's a windshield repair or replacement windshield. You can count in these guys every time. I would recommend these guys and know they'd live up to your expectations
__label__4	The first time I was there. My brother in-law said that he was there before and it was OK .the two of us had the turkey breast dinner. While both of the girls had a a salad one was good. The other hand the other had wilted lettuce on . the service was so so with few people in the place. Had to ask numerous times for refills. Try it if no other choice
__label__4	Hidden Gem on Davis Island. Sushi and Mediterranean Food is very good. No longer has the brunch buffet but was pleasantly surprised.
__label__4	Love Jessie's great food and friendly service.  The lines can be brutal but that's because it's so good.
__label__4	I love going here especially getting closer to the holidays. When I entered the doors I was greated and offered a sample of famous Lindor chocolate. They have tons of selection for different types decadent chocolates! there's even some special flavors for Halloween. They sometimes have a great Groupon worth getting before going. Easy to get chocolate gifts here and even a treat for yourself! My favorite is a dark chocolate infused with strawberries but the salted caramel milk chocolate is a close second!
__label__4	"Our comped room was beautiful.  I totally wasn't expecting it to be nice, but I was pleasantly surprised.

They had cookies waiting for us in the evening and set out a few nice pieces of chocolate.  The bathroom was nice and big and the water pressure STRONG!

Our drain in the bathtub was really slow, so I called housekeeping and they fixed it right away. 

The casino is huge and, even on a busy weekend, there were plenty of tables open and slots to be had."
__label__4	My group of friends really enjoyed the pub crawl with Linley. Took us to three fun pubs, we had good deals and she told fun stories.
__label__4	First time here. Won't be the last. Meals are family style.  The #1 included 12 snow crab legs, 17 shrimp, 2 sausage, 2 corn. 2 eggs and a whole lot of potatoes and butter. All good. Fed two of us with enough in a go box for two lunches. $39.99.
__label__4	"Nice selection of food 
Skip the hibachi and feast on the sushi"
__label__4	The place has the ambience of a submarine. However the price is great, staff excellent, hours superb, and the food is good. The burgers are to die for and the same price as a quarter pounder with twice the taste and value. The donair and shawarma are also not bad. Portions are designed to fill a redneck stomach. They have the prayer music running in the background which I find really nice.
__label__4	We went on a Friday night and got the budget buster meal. Chicken was tender and a good taste. Baked beans and corn ok. We love their rewards program got free donut holes. Service was excellent
__label__4	"We went for the Sunday brunch and the caprinhna cocktail tastes like lime lemonade.  The mango smoothie version is smooth and creamy. Both don't taste like there's any alcohol.
 
My favorite dishes are the rock cod, salad w/ ranch dressing, papaya salad, and cheeses w/ guava jelly.  The rock cod fish was cooked perfectly in the stew sauce. The salad w/ ranch dressing is good because it doesn't gave a strong ranch taste.  Definitely would comeback for those dishes."
__label__4	BJ's is not a fancy eatery, but a simple buffet that also offers meat-and-2 veggies, as well as take out.  They have the crispest chicken and banana pudding that is closer to homemade than anything around, and also have good cornbread hoecakes.  The price is very cheap at $7.95 per person for all you can eat, including dessert.  The gals who work there are very friendly.  Try it - you'll like it.
__label__4	Our first time having brunch in Philadelphia, we were looking for something close to the hotel that didn't require a reservation. Called beforehand and the hostess was very polite. Parking is tricky in the area, so be prepared. We sat upstairs and the ambiance of the restaurant was great; it can be loud but wasn't a problem for us. I love the seating arrangements  and overall decor. Our food and drinks were great, enjoyed everything except the server took a long time in between getting water, ordering food and drinks.
__label__4	"Nice location.  Took my food to-go, and had lunch on the beach.  Food was pretty good.  I can't remember what i ordered.  but i do remember the dessert of the day was deliciously chocolatey.

Food: 4 stars
Service: na 
Ambiance:  3 stars (sorta feels like a old people home)
Overall:  4 star"
__label__4	"4.5 stars here

When I am down south I don't usually do chains unless its Sonny's. Always great service and great food.

Service was excellent. Salad bar was clean with many options. I got one of those combo plates and couldn't have been any more pleased. The portions are generous and the cornbread is awesome.

Great work guys!"
__label__4	As a Quarterite I've been going here for 20 years.  Atmosphere is wonderful even when it's crowded.  Not a chain, in fact they supply many other coffee shops with pastries daily.
__label__4	The seafood burger was flavorful and juicy. It didn't need any additional condiments and the fries were really good too. I'm not crazy over fries so I was pleasantly surprised and I also know that the seafood fries must be amazing, I'm trying that next!
__label__4	"One thing I love about New Orleans: diverse cultural uniqueness at every corner. While walking around looking for a place to eat, we stumbled across this cute little boutique. Their window display caught our attention....cork-like merchandise?! 

The friendly lady behind the counter greeted us warmly as we looked around. They had purses, hats, bracelets and shoes I thought were so cute! The material is soft to touch. The fedora hats were definitely my favorite. If you're looking for a unique gift to give, this is a great place to stop by."
__label__4	Nadeen's was amazing, there is a long wait because the food and music is really good.We sat at the bar and enjoyed it.The parking is limited but we got a space. The food was really good, The owner was super friendly,very nice and accommodating. I would suggest trying this out if your in the area.
__label__4	My lady says this place has a old Key West bed and breakfast feel. I thought it was a great price for the one night stay we were looking for. The manager was friendly. It's a quaint place with a grandmas house feeling. So close to all the great spots in St. Pete. Continental breakfast was served. Very quite spot. The only complaint is the parking situation. We couldn't park at the hotel, because the church next door needed the lot.
__label__4	"I stopped coming here for a bit bc I had a few times of awful service. But thank goodness that seems to have been resolved-great bar food, great spot.
Go for Linda the bartender bc shes one of the BEST."
__label__4	First time going to any Emeril's Restaurant and it was pretty good.  The prices weren't too bad.  I would definitely go back again if I was in New Orleans again
__label__4	I was introduced to Portillo's a couple of years ago.  I was in the area and wanted some chili.  I order a bowl of chili and the Maxwell Street Polish dog.  No disappointments here! Excellent.  And don't forget the chocolate cake mile shake!
__label__4	Ok, let me start by saying I was shocked by the prices here!  Next I was shocked by how much I loved the cupcakes!  I would not spend $3.00 for a cupcake more than once a week or so, but this is a treat you need to do.  I was going to be cheap, but then decided to make the plunge.  Purchased the Red Velvet, Devils Food and a chocolate vegan cup cake.  All three were very good.  Do your self a favor and go here and splurge!  WOW all the bad reviews must have eaten something I didn't?
__label__4	The food is good and the staff is really nice. The views our stunning! I recommend this to everyone!
__label__4	I was a little nervous about dining here after reading some of the reviews. But, I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. The wait staff was pleasant and the owner was very cordial. The steak and salmon we had was cooked to perfection. I would definitely come back here again.
__label__4	Sonnys is a great place to hang out with friends or meet up after work. You're bound to catch live music, trivia on weekdays, and there's games as well in the outside lawn area. For private parties, there's cabanas for your group to sit and drink/ eat. We had a sample of the tacos and all were bland or meat/ fish were overcooked. Overall, I would come back for the atmosphere but not the food.
__label__4	Solid food, great accommodations, friendly way to staff, and quick service make this one a decent stop. Cheesesteak was fresh and large portion, soup was good, burgers were great, and quesadilla was also very good. Clean restrooms always a plus. And the coffee was spectacular.
__label__4	Great brunch. Burger was solid. Lump crab and tomato toast was very flavorful. Nice soulful music. Clean. Waiter was pleasant
__label__4	What a lovely place to sit and have a meal. Brunch is tasty. Sweet potato fries and the sangria are my two favorite menu items. The desserts are to die for! Ross with his cute apron is a wonderful waiter who works hard to get your order out in a timely fashion and is friendly. Eddie is the best expo I've ever seen.
__label__4	"I love the old feel of this place. The burgers are great and the fries are superb.  Right down the street from work and will be going there when I ""forget"" my lunch."
__label__4	Typical Sam's Club. They had some samples available, but not as much as some of the other stores. Store was clean and wasn't all that busy. They had everything I needed, so no complaints!
__label__4	They have perfected hot, delicious, fresh made pizza by the slice! Great salads and a fantastic bar. We enjoy this location lot!
__label__4	Food was fabulous.  Visiting from out of town with a group of 4.  Everyone enjoyed their selections.
__label__4	This place is a great spot for wraps and flatbreads! I personally loved the flavor of the wrap but found it hard to give 5 full stars because it was lacking protein. The wrap was full of greens and would have been better if it had a bigger serving of protein. The flatbread was great and full of flavor and packed with toppings! Super cool place inside with a sauce bar! Try the honey hot it was great for dipping the flatbread! Definitely will be going back to try other things on the menu!
__label__4	Our first time with family. Great atmosphere, laid back beach vibe. Food and drinks were good and our waitress, Emilie was great! We will be back!
__label__4	I have been to my fair share of tap rooms and microbreweries and this place has the best food ever (for a tap room). The IPA was excellent, but the German-style beers weren't quite as good. Mussels in traditional white wine garlic sauce are the perfect compliment to a Belgian-style brew. And they have a full bar, so the non beer drinker (lunatic) can enjoy a cocktail .
__label__4	Giovanni has been manning the grill and talk yelling since 1979.  I am glad it was a very good cheesesteak.  The neighborhood has seen better days.  I tried to get Ms Pacman into the photo.
__label__4	Love to check the spot out whenever I'm in Wilmington. They have incredibly friendly service and the best Thai wings and all of the East Coast. I've had their noodle dishes as well as their salt and pepper chicken. All have been delicious and enjoyable. Will return again for the pho!
__label__4	This bakery has a lot of variety of baked goods.  I bought a buttercream cake with buttercream filling.   The cake was moist and fresh but the almond flavor was a bit too strong and I thought the frosting was too sweet.  My sweet tooth was satisfied after 1 piece. Couldn't have eaten another if I wanted.  I'd go back for other bake goods which looked great.
__label__4	Tried this place for the first time yesterday for lunch. I got the fried shrimp sandwich as well as the rice and beans for a side. The sandwich was pretty good I really liked the batter for the shrimp. The rice and beans were also really good. For a po boy sandwich in Indianapolis I was pretty impressed. To say the least I was satisfied and def will try more of their menu.
__label__4	The fried chicken was everything it was hyped up to be.  The Mac n cheese was amazing except a bit too hot for everyone at the table one could not eat it at all. The bread pudding was delicious.
__label__4	"Ordered a large pie last night and loved it! 

half pepperoni, half federico.

Pepperoni was amazing, perfectly hot and cheesy with lots of pepperoni

But the federico was eh. There was a lot of shredded chicken, not enough flavors though. It needed a lot more sauce, either salsa verde or maybe it needed some type of creamy sauce because the chicken really dried the pizza out, it felt like i was eating just shredded chicken and dough.

But all in all, service was quick and pizza was good! I need to try different toppings next time"
__label__4	Look forward to this place every time I visit Boise. I always get the all you can eat, I just wish I had more room in my stomach. The sushi tastes very fresh. The appetizers are even included in the dinner AYCE. If you're in the area definitely give this place a try. I'm pretty sure you'll be back.
__label__4	"I used to live in the area and had been here a couple of times throughout before they revamped the store. I've visited more recently, and wow, they did a lot! The store is a lot nicer than it used to be, and it has that nice look to add to the experience, unlike the older style that it had before.

I'm a big fan of Aldi, especially now that they're doing more to compete on a bigger scale with bigger grocery chains. Lots of good produce and snacks, and all at great prices!"
__label__4	"Decent vegetarian Indian food at reasonable prices.  The lunch buffet, while not necessarily the most ""formal"" of buffets, is the cleanest, freshest buffet I have found in South Jersey.  Some of the food does tend to be hot, but I am OK with hot.  The owner is friendly, and the dining area is very clean.   While not the best Indian food I've ever had, it is good enough for me to want to want to have lunch there often."
__label__4	We stopped here when they first opened and had the Old Forge pizza. it was just okay.  It seemed a little like frozen or something.  We stopped in again and picked up an Xlarge margarita and Xlarge pepperoni on Sunday night. The crust was nice, think and crispy!  The pizza tasted fresh.  We will definitely be back. Based on the reviews I think a cheese steak will be next on my list!  Some say they went downhill but I will still give it a shot!
__label__4	"When you want Asian food around the Creve Coeur area, you have a lot of choices.  OK, so Stir Crazy is a very Americanized version of Asian food, but it's pretty darned tasty and offers patrons a choice of ordering from the menu or building an entree Mongolian BBQ style.  Yum.

Atmosphere is friendly - great lunch place.  Only thing that keeps it from  being a 5 is that it's a bit on the loud side when at full capacity.

Of course, it's smoke free.  And that's the best part.

hln"
__label__4	"I met my friends here on a Friday morning. The selection of drinks and unique flavors were great. I had the rock n roll iced drink and it was awesome! Totally satisfied my craving for something sweet.

There were a good amount of seats but a few minutes after we got there most were taken. It's a cozy relaxed place with very comfortable couches and nice decor. A good place to chill by yourself or with friends."
__label__4	So good! Love all their flavors and what they have to offer. I wish they had blenders down south!
__label__4	Went there to dance and it was great but it totally depended on the DJ. They never advertise when he will be there as he gets a huge crowd. What's wrong with these new businesses never advertising?
__label__4	Yummy food. Don't be frightened Pinellas! Banh mi are great. Pho is tasty. Inexpensive and a good value for your money.
__label__4	This was our first stop into NOLA.  After the 7 hour drive we arrived very hungry and these po boys were just what we needed!  We tried the shrimp and the smoked sausage and both were excellent.  The flavors of the 2 different sandwiches actually complimented each other really well.  This was a great start to our trip and we will definitely go back next time we're in the area.
__label__4	I eat here quite often.  Never had a bad meal.  It's always clean, and food is very good.  Staff are friendly.  That's all I need for a go-to lunch or dinner.
__label__4	Good coffee and food but tight set up, have to order up front then they bring your food.  It was just ok.
__label__4	Really liked this bustling restaurant.  The food was very good.  I highly recommend the sriracha deviled eggs.  To many choices and will go back during my visit.  The only disappointment was my Manhattan.  It was horrible.  Don't know who trained the bartender, but he/she definitely needs to get some remedial training.
__label__4	Cool and quiet ambiance. My husband had the pimento burger and I had the grouper. Service was a little slow. Not authentic French but was good.
__label__4	I'm addicted to their Bun Mam (an aromatic noodle soup). I daydream about eating this on a cold day when the weather is too hot to bear. I miss it when I haven't had it for a couple weeks. It's one of my favorite things to eat. I eat it when I'm sad and everything that is bad in my life seems to be not so bad again.
__label__4	Pretty good for a fast Mexican meal. It was extremely crowded so get there early if you can. Also, this is not a sit down restaurant. You order at the window and find a table. Mole sauce was some of the best I've had. Food was fresh and salsa bar was nice.
__label__4	"No long waiting times, friendly and  professional and great location.  Definitely would go back if ever needed.
Rob H."
__label__4	I was here with my bf last Sat to grab something quick after my hair appointment. I had the vege club. 1 of the 4 sandwiches on my plate had a strand of hair on it which threw me off. I'm a lil antsy when it comes to hygiene and presentation. I went up to the manager and he asked no questions. Refunded my entire bill and gave me 2 free vouchers for my next visit. I understand mistakes such as this happens here and there, appreciated the fact they owned up to it and fixed the situation.
__label__4	Stayed here in August with family in two of the hotel rooms/suites.  Really enjoyed our visit.  Were visiting grandparents who live  locally with our young children. We are not RV people but really enjoyed all this park had to offer.  Our kids loved the pool, horse shoe pit and community it room.  It's not  the fanciest place but the rooms were clean and comfortable breakfast was included which was lovely and the staff could not have been nicer to us.  Will stay again when we visit next year.
__label__4	This restaurant was a life saver when we were desperately looking for a place to eat one night when on vacation. The food and service were both fabulous and the waiter even offered us plastic cups to take our unfinished drinks to go. Yes, there are a lot of tourists here, but the quality of the food and the essence of NOLA flavor is not compromised. Food tasted as it should and prices were reasonable, considering the location.
__label__4	"Like the decor inside! Sushi was good, and at very fair price! 

The only negative to the experience was there was no music or background noise, so you could easily overhear the staff talking and other customers conversations. 

The staff was not rude, but definitely not the most friendly. No greeting when entering or exiting. Kind of a ""get in, eat, and get out"" feel."
__label__4	"Red velvet ice cream cake is the most amazing ice cream cake ever! My husband's two favorite things are red velvet and oreos. They made his cake with both! He was so surprised with his cake and it was the talk of his office for a week. Maggie Moos is hands down better than Cold Stone. I was so sad when a few of their locations closed. I started coming all the way from Scott AFB to the Fenton location because seeing that silly cow on the box always set the bar high on what we were getting. 

By the way this location sucks during traffic."
__label__4	"Hangout spot if there's nothing else going on or the first stop of the night. The food is really great..i usually get something from the shareables section: the mozzarella sticks & quesadilla's are really good. 
I also love watching UFC fights as well as other sporting events here..always brings out a good crowd."
__label__4	I think it's overrated but my boyfriend loved it! Their specialty coffee is like a regular cafe con leche in Miami (I'm a Miami native). I went so I could check it off my bucket list lol but other friends also thought it wasn't out of this world.
__label__4	"Big portions, good food. We started with stuffed mushrooms and mozzarella.
I asked for more bread ad some butter (just oil on the table)  I had ask another server and then it was ""all good""

My mother and niece really enjoined  their 
Chicken parmigiana. (That's whats spell- check was correct) :-). My husband had something delicious.  The short ribs were
Outstanding."
__label__4	出品不錯 服務也OK 會再次惠顧 chop chop is my favorite 每週有四款菜式有特別優惠 週末人比較多 最好提前訂位
__label__4	Cool place right in the middle of downtown Tampa conveniently located across from our hotel. We dropped by for a quick beer and a snack. Extensive beer selection including IPA's. Friendly service. Good menu. I would say unique for a bar. We had the blackened shrimp and avocado toast. Really light and good. Prime rib looked delish. Would definitely recommend for just a beer or more.
__label__4	My wife and I have gotten food here a few times since moving to this area. They give a lot of food for a decent price. The customer service has always been good and the food is good.
__label__4	Probably one of the healthiest places I've been to in Edmonton. I ordered the marinated mushrooms with avocado toast, and I will say it tasted a bit odd at first , but you slowly start to like it. My friends ordered the açai bowl and Thai salad, both tasted great. Service was amazing , atmosphere was amazing , and the pricing was decent , depending on what you ordered. Parking is definitely a slight issue as it is downtown.
__label__4	Kimmel is sort of a staple for those of us that line our fine arts.  I just always find their staff to be pretty miserable.  I get that after a performance you guys wanna go home, but we paid a lot of money for our tickets so let us hang out for a little while and take in the beauty, okay?
__label__4	We ended up not needing to wait the 45 minutes for a table by sitting at the bar. So many people did that though that I had people sharing a stool next to me while I ate - bumping hands and elbows. The tuna salad was fabulous though. And eventually we were able to move down a chair and I could eat properly. My companion had the Thai salad. Also tasty and ample. Bar staff was on point.
__label__4	"Absolutely delicious! So happy to have found Brigantessa. Every single thing on the menu is so flavorful and makes you want more. A huge bonus is they let you do half portions to try more than one dish at a time. The service was incredible and the ambiance was a lot nicer than the typical south philly Italian restaurant. Ever since I went here, I've been recommending it to everyone! 

The one thing keeping from 5 stars is there's a $40 corking fee!! Not cool for philly at all."
__label__4	"This place kinda reminds me of Hong Kong (I know they are Japanese!)...a little dingy but awesome food! The sushi signs are hand written on paper and hung on the wall...love that.

Had the Chef Special roll (awesome)
and the ole standard Cali Roll (also excellent)

Its the ONLY sushi place I will go to in Pasco (not thrilled will food selection in pasco for sure..)"
__label__4	It's a cute, local place. The food is fresh and original. We loved the Brussels sprouts appetizer. The decor isn't my style and could use an update, but our meal and service was really good.
__label__4	We went around Christmas for some stocking stuffers. Every single register was open. Crew was actively restocking throughout the night. Hell, some of them were even laughing and joking with customers. This is the best dollar store I've ever been to, and I'm po' so I go to them a lot!
__label__4	The octopus was wonderful!  I loved  the new decor, service was  great.  We had the sea bass and lobster- good but did not stand up to octopus.  I will definitely come back.
__label__4	I currently live at the Bardmoor Villa. The friendly people at Phillip Scott Management are professional and prompt with maintenance repairs and all issues regarding the property. You have gained a long time tenant. Keep up the great work!
__label__4	"Good service and clean. Just do not understand why an American ""Irish"" pub does not carry pints of Guinness. 

Other than that great welcoming place."
__label__4	Great spot for just about any meal in Nashville! I would recommend making a reservation (they take them for breakfast, lunch and dinner) as it does get very crowded very quickly! All six of us were pleased with our meal but one member of our group got rubbery chicken. Waitstaff was quick to fix it and manager stopped by to let us know they would take it off the ticket. Customer service alone makes it worth coming back!
__label__4	Excellent in terms of variety. Very large place, wear comfy shoes. We usually walk around for 1-2 hours and see something different each visit. Recommended.
__label__4	The restaurant is a seat yourself style but we were lucky enough to spot a few empty tables when we arrived. The beer menu is pretty extensive and the waitress was a great resource. The cocktail menu was nice, with some interesting and appealing choices. The menu isn't large but there were more than enough options. The cuban sandwich and honey truffle flatbread were our choices and both were excellent. The atmosphere was a bit chilly - open and bright with lots of windows, which I'm certain will be more appealing when the weather warms up. We will definitely return.
__label__4	Love going to this car wash. The owner/mgr Tom is always on site ...which means the staff is quick and thorough.   It's a common site to see HIM with a towel wiping down a dashboard or drying off a mini-van to make the line move quicker.   It's the best place to go for a fast clean and you're on your way.   I live near there and take advantage of his 10 ticket program.  Worth the money up front.....for the convenience on the back end.  His details are outstanding too.
__label__4	Food is good. They serve delicious beers. Its an active atmosphere so do not expect a quiet meal. The service could be a little better, but its in the heart of downtown. Totally understand it gets busy, maybe management could offer some help to the young ladies or hire another food and drink runner? I give it a 4/5 because the atmosphere is nice, its a fun place to go with friends! Ps- The deep fried oreos are to die for. The burgers are great and the sweet potato fries are awesome. Try a different burger every time you visit.
__label__4	"Pizza @ Napolese is the bombdiggity! The use of fresh local ingredients is a plus. Cured Meat appetizer is delish. All salads are fantastic & bountiful with great/creative ingredients. The pizza made in the oven direct from Italy is the real deal. Chewy charred crust is the way it should be.  

Each Napolese location has a slightly different feel, yet they are all busy & energetic-no quiet romantic dinners here- as noise level is pretty intense."
__label__4	Love the outdoor concept and the courtyard is so relaxing and pretty. It could definitely use more variety in the selection of stores, but it's a nice place to get a cop of coffee and walk around on a sunny afternoon.
__label__4	"Yes, it's a chain, but yes, it's quite good.

The vibe is great, loud but not noisy, family setting in a Tex Mex environment.  I got chicken Boom Boom enchiladas, spicy, which were delicious in the sauce n beans they served with it.  12$.  

Service was fast and they had a viewable booth with the rotating tabletop cooking the corn tortillas which was cool.

I'd go back"
__label__4	Love this place; every favor is an unforgettable adventure in your mouth!  Hats off to the amazing ice cream chef and staff that provides both a smile and excellent service :)
__label__4	I'd given up on eating Mexican food ever since I stopped eating meat and dairy a few months ago. I always end up with a bare bones taco once I ask for no sour cream and cheese. Some Mexican restaurants don't even have fish or shrimp as options. But Xtreme taco has the best tacos with tasty shrimp and enough dairy free toppings to make it a complete and filling meal. I ordered the shrimp burrito for my husband and it was HUGE. Very tasty food, priced well and friendly staff.
__label__4	We really enjoyed our breakfast sandwich and fig, walnut, and arugula croissant sandwich. The coffee was good, but oddly they don't offer fresh milk or half and half. There are only those non refrigerated creamers. I will not use those and think it's odd that they offer those with their better quality coffee.
__label__4	The service was amazing. We were in and out in under an hour. Didn't feel rushed but didn't have to wait for the check. The burger was average, not the best but worth the $$. The ice cream was amazing. The vanilla tasted homemade, like something from a fair. Very good experience.
__label__4	City Winery has a great atmosphere. One of the most unique one in the city of Nashville. They have a fully stocked bar that stock themselves. The venue is small so there's a close knit atmosphere. The food while slightly overpriced was good and well seasoned. The waiters were attentive as well. The music was nice. MoonChild was a good group. They had the venue staying on there feet for them. It was a great concert experience.
__label__4	"Hurricanes, excellent.

A really calm place late on a sunday night, it was cold on the outside dining area near a fountain with a huge flame coming out of it but there were also heaters about the tables to keep warm too.  

Suprisingly the food I ordered was really good, the chicken wings were excellent, and the short ribs was almost the best I've ever had.  Noisy and crowded, typical of New Orleans I'd assume.  

A touch too crowded for my taste though, 4.5"
__label__4	This place is good. Good service. Good food. Heavy-duty chairs - seriously you've got to see this things. The location is good, too. Santa Barbara probably has better Italian but for tourists this place is pretty good. Definitely worth a visit.
__label__4	Charbroiled oysters, Crabcakes, & Seafood Platter = YUM!
__label__4	We enjoy sitting outside since the restaurant is on the second floor. I liked the veggie burger (it's vegetarian but not vegan). During happy hour it's buy one get one free drinks. I ordered margaritas and they were yummy, but be careful because they are strong (you get your money's worth!).
__label__4	The food is pretty good, but not spectacular. It's a mix of Italian and American (pasta, pizza, sandwiches, burgers, etc.). That said, I've always been happy with what I've ordered and the service has always been excellent. I love all the random stuff on the walls, it really adds to atmosphere and keeps the restaurant from being plain and sterile. I'll definitely return, but if I'm looking for something spectacular, unusual, or gourmet..I'll go elsewhere.
__label__4	Good pizza, better spinach rolls.  The Canolis are mediocre. This is the better of the 2 fishawk pizza places.
__label__4	"Conveniently located, cute, clean, friendly little shop! 

The menu is a little confusing with quite a few options that are nearly identical except one ingredient, but it's a little hard to identify what that is right away. Regardless, the smoothies are tasty and quickly made to order! 

Can't go wrong with strawberry banana, even the ""small"" is a generous portion!"
__label__4	Standard IHOP. Sometimes the service is great and other times it's not so good. Today I didn't have any silverware and did t realize until after they served breakfast. The guy didn't check back so we grabbed some from another table.
__label__4	I love this place. Love the Dan Dan noodles, the scallion pancake, the three cup chicken, and all the dumplings. It's delicious, the service is good, and the food is not as agonisingly spicy as some reviews say. It reminds me of all the old Szechuan places on Spadina in Toronto, except marginally better and more upscale. Good, interesting cocktails too.
__label__4	Very nice spot. We ordered our food to-go through the web and requested it to be ready at 12:45. It was ready when we arrived at 12:50 still hot still DELICIOUS. I ordered the crawfish etouffee on grits. We also ordered chicken and waffles. Everything was great.
__label__4	Sports bar in Clearwater Beach, went there to watch football and eat. Great happy hour with $1.75 domestic drafts. Had dinner. The portions were large, the food was good. Only drawback is parking, but that's a drawback just about everywhere in Clearwater Beach.
__label__4	A great spot offering an abundant lunch special! I honestly prefer the taste of the food from the original owners however they still deliver a good meal. I visited recently for my birthday lunch, ordering Pad thai, a few curries and fried rice. In my opinion, the Pad Thai tasted unnatural and overly sweet. The curry was delicious, we ordered a Panang and Massaman with an extra side of rice. The fried rice was also a hit!
__label__4	Pretty solid BBQ.  Having just stopped through, was pleasantly surprised that they have a BBQ joint down in Gulfport.  Had the pulled pork and the ribs, and both were good.
__label__4	The wife and I love this place.  Food is always interesting and well prepared and the service is great.  Open kitchen is very cool.  It would be 5 stars if it wasn't such tight quarters.  Go early......
__label__4	Great food and outdoor deck! I love the view to the south. Beer is really cold! I stop every time I visit Tucson! My Dad's favorite place...visits several times a week.
__label__4	Had to order out due to this Messed Up Predicament We all have had to go thru since This Epidemic Started. However, even though ordering out in my opinion has never been as good as actually dining  in . But the food was spectacular. The Flavor was delicious. My only Complaint would be the two dinners that I ordered was supposed to come with corn on the cob and potatoes with my Shrimp and shellfish but both bags were without potato's and my husband didn't receive a cob. Price was actually not as bad considering what usual places would charge for Sea Food.
__label__4	Stopped in for the first time with our Friday morning breakfast club, happy to say all enjoyed their meal. The food was excellent and the portions were more then adequate, the service was also outstanding no waiting for refills on the coffee of for anything that was requested.  Grumpy's will become one our regular spot to enjoy breakfast
__label__4	Had the oxtails (rich and delicious) and the rice and peas (well seasoned and tasty) and the Mac and cheese (just ok). Place is new and i hope it does well.. happy to have these Mom and pop places open up in the burbs .. will definitely be back to try the beef patties and jerk chicken .
__label__4	"I think I can see both sides of the Bookman argument.  While they do have a potentially high trash-to-treasure ratio, it seems that I always, and I mean ALWAYS, seem to find some unexpected treasure in here.  

Although never intrigued by the books they set outside in an apparent attempt to lure you in, I have enjoyed the looking around I have done once I enter."
__label__4	Great little spot, friendly staff & a killer cold brew. I went strong and added two double shots to my brew and it was fantastic. Kids loved the bagels so not much more you could ask for.
__label__4	"I've had cheesesteaks and hoggies (hoagies) from here and have not been disappointed.  They put a lot of meat on them.  But I always order delivery and have never set foot inside the shop.  The fries usually arrive soggy, so I've stopped ordering them.  The delivery is very fast.

I order from here during my weak moments.  Obviously since I am the Duchess, I have more weak moments than I care to admit....

That is all."
__label__4	Great day on some great courses! Staff is very friendly and able to offer assistance whenever needed! Courses for any skill level
__label__4	It's pretty good. Has great food, a very extensive menu and the wait staff is friendly and efficient. My only real complaint about this place is its LOUD! It's a big place with a lot of people, loud music & tv's. If you are looking for a romantic dinner for 2, this is not the place.
__label__4	"The ribs are great... but I will never eat there again. 

I had the most intense food allergic reaction to their ribs. Have you ever seen Hitch? The part where Will Smith eats shellfish and his face blows up? Ya that was me after eating Pappy's.....

......but it was totally worth it!"
__label__4	If you are looking for a good haircut at a fair price and don't want the hassles of a salon or some fancy hair cutting place. Then come here my friend. Kelly is professional, quick and chatty. Just as a real barber shop should be.
__label__4	We were looking for a place to grab a bite that wasn't filled with tourists, so we stopped in to Snug Harbor, which is a couple blocks off Bourbon Street. It's an older place with that 70s Naugahide restaurant/bar vibe.  My friends and I were all satisfied with our meals. The fried chicken was tender and juicy,  but needed a bit more salt and pepper for my taste.  My friend said her gumbo was delicious.  The waitstaff was attentive and friendly,  too.
__label__4	Great place for duck, roasted pork and wonton soup. This is the only place I like for wonton soup.
__label__4	Giving it 4 stars for the mushrooms and boneless chicken. Both were exceptional. Husband ordered the Monster Chicken sandwich but they ran out of chicken breast. He went with the Monster Burger instead. My boneless chicken was so good; he was really disappointed in the burger. The burger lacked favor and seasoning. He'd wished he'd have gone with the chunks instead. Waitress said they should have more chicken breast tomorrow, but tonight is our last night in town. So, it is what it is.
__label__4	Tasty and well priced food.  Ordered chicken breast with chorizo on top.  It was excellent.  I wasn't crazy about the rice but the refried beans were good.  Service was efficient.  A great yelp find!
__label__4	Chili's has refreshed their menu and for the same price as Qdoba or Subway you can get delicious food and great service. Their margarita menu is also fantastic.
__label__4	Went for Dinner at 6pm on a Friday and expect it to be packed, luckily for us, it wasn't. The staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is straight out of Magnolia Journal. The food was pretty dang good and drinks are too. The only reason I left off a star was the fact it took a little while to get our cocktails and our appetizer came at the same time as our food. But, they're new and I've been in hospitality before, so I get it!
__label__4	Food is good. My only complaint is, the wait to aways a little long and it could have more room inside
__label__4	Such a beautiful venue, inside and out! The owner was pretty laid back guy who's into music and has a band so he's super busy outside of Open Space and also pretty hard to get ahold of! His assistant Martian is a character and such an amazing human being, we loved his personality and customer service! Martian promised us a beautiful, clean space and that's exactly what he delivered! Highly recommend and would definitely use this space again in the future!
__label__4	"Cozy place. Good food. Lovely staff. 
Baked clams are the best."
__label__4	Pizza is really good! The chicken parmesan sandwich is okay. It was pretty tiny and didn't fill my husband up. Good thing we ordered pizza too! Overall, I would definitely order the pizza again!  Only downside- they don't deliver!
__label__4	This is the place to go if you want a well poured drinks, for good price.  The atmosphere here is good,  friendly folks,  but the drinks will keep you coming back.  Nothing spectacular,  just your run of the mill dive bar...  If you get a chance,  and you're low on cash,  this is the place...
__label__4	Went for a wash, cut, and blow dry for the first time as a walk-in and I didn't even have to wait. I have very long hair and both Molly and Sophia took very good care of me. Price is affordable. Their attention to detail is like no other I've experienced before.
__label__4	Looks like a dive , but take a plunge into their deliciousness! Huge sandwiches; we shared a tender juicy roast beef with lettuce. The bread was light and oooooh so right. We got a small side of the beans and rice which was spiced really nice.
__label__4	LOVED the seafood pizza. Great drinks, made me a fan of NOLA again. :)
__label__4	"I'm really sad that Saviour's recently caused.  The hubs and I were just saying we looked forward to returning here for their Vegetarian Platter and outstanding coffee. 

:-("
__label__4	I ate dinner here for the first time last night. I got the wine pack and then went outside and ordered barbecue from the food truck out front. I really enjoy the atmosphere of this establishment. They have live music by a gentleman that has been inducted into the blues Hall of Fame named Chip. I'll just say the wine was good the food was very good the music was amazing. I love being in the south and this place just personifies good friends good food good times. I will be back.
__label__4	Went for the Sushi/Sashimi instead of teppanyaki.  Since it was Friday the choice was only all you can eat.  You choose from set items off the menu depending on what you choose but you can eat as much as you can.  My advice if you want to try to sample more of the menu is to ask for half orders.  Food was great and service was as well.  With the teppanyaki set ups in the restaurant it makes for a lively vibe.
__label__4	Heard about this new place and was excited to try good pizza ( which is rare in South Jersey). We did order out the rustica pizza and an order of bruschetta. Upon entering the two waitresses were inattentive however the pizza maker greeted me. The pizza was great the ingredients were fresh and tasty. I probably will dine in next time as the crust was a touch soggy once home. And it's BYOB so may be our Friday pizza night spot.
__label__4	"Good for brunch! Prices are reasonable for the portions given and the staff is kind. 

Great atmosphere and clean, would recommend to anyone looking for a relaxed time."
__label__4	"yummy ice cream. gadzooks blanc was yummy! sweet heaven.  the guatemala riffles was delicious with coffee flavor! yummm

get some ice cream!!!!"
__label__4	My favorite Pizza Place in Tampa if you're trying to avoid obnoxious crowds. Beer selection is always good. The Pizza is great not the best but pretty high up there. Would go to Lee's over Cappy's any day.
__label__4	"Brave New Worlds is a great comic shop with great great staff and many offerings from Comics to Gaming. They usually have a nice mix of independent comics too, and will order anything your looking for. They also have great sales from time to time, and the staff is pretty awesome. 

You really can't go wrong here, although my only criticism is that there could be more independents on the shelf. I haven't found a shop that carried many Indies these days so it's hard to fault them on that... 

The staff is super cool so stop in and get your fix!!!"
__label__4	Decent spot. Definitely have good drink specials. Typical bar food, good sandwiches, pizzas, n quesadillas. Food a tab over priced but constant with the neighborhoods dubious self worth. I would definitely go back. The outdoor porch is nice.
__label__4	Great buffet with a pretty decent selection. I enjoyed everything I tried...which was a little of everything on the buffet! My dinner companion and I agreed that it was better than most of the buffets we have been to in Philly. Service was also excellent.
__label__4	Had the crab and corn bisque and it was DELICIOUS!!! My friends got the seafood platter and they loved it as well.
__label__4	"Had to try this place out. Ok lines are long I recommend coming during the week, was not that bad So I got the Jambalaya( love this) , two roast beef PO boys , hush puppies and steamers. 
THe roast beef was so tender like butter and the Au  Ju they use is amazing Everything was delicious and fresh. Probably one of the best places to get your Cajun on !"
__label__4	If you like coffee and books, this is the place for you. Doubling as a second hand book store, Mandolin serves great coffee. There's no kitchen here but they do offer a small selection of sweet and savory items to choose from. The breakfast wrap I had was very good, much to my surprise given that it wasn't made fresh in house. Give yourself some extra time to peruse the books, they have a great selection. Mandolin is definitely worth a stop, as long as your not looking for a meal.
__label__4	Amazing brunch options in the French quarter. We arrived at 11.30, right before the rush. Coffee is offered with condensed milk, delicious. We shared the duck confit hash with a perfectly poached duck egg. The truffle grits were delicious and earthy. Wishing this restaurant was in San Francisco so I could eat brunch there every weekend.
__label__4	"Overall the food was great a little heavy on seasonings but I recommend this for family's or not 
It's cozy and warm not overwhelming at all."
__label__4	Great barbecue! Brisket and chicken was Smokee! Loved the restaurant environment- nice owner! Good bbq sauce! And the deserts were tasty!
__label__4	The food, service and views were amazing. If the wine list was better they would've received 5 stars from me. So- if wine's not your thing then this place ticks all the boxes.
__label__4	"I have been here several times and love it. The food is very well made and fresh. It is all you can eat, but you order small portions in batches from the waitress. Expect everyone at the table to get your food at different times. 

They have other dishes besides sushi if there is someone in your group who isn't a fan. The udon noodles, tempura vegetables, and miso are great.

It can get very busy so reservations on weekends are recommended. The place is pretty small."
__label__4	Had the 2 for 22 deal burgers were great came with cheese sticks was great except for marinara it was awful tasted like that 99 cent stuff at dollar store Liz waited on us ill go back just to see her but food was good and fair prices
__label__4	"As always this is the one chain that doesn't disappoint. Stoli Doli to start. crock of onion soup was enormous , filet oscar I don't even know where to begin, cooked to perfection. 

My friend had the porter house which was 22oz of goodness. A little pricy but worth it. Service is outstanding as well..

Stuff to share.. French beans and tomatoes, Lobster Mac and cheese enough said.."
__label__4	"Bagels are good.
The place is always uncomfortably cold.
I've asked management about it but they cannot control the thermostat. 
Perhaps we'll have to go somewhere else to find a comfortable place to eat breakfast."
__label__4	Great and authentic Cajun cuisine. Seafood gumbo id's full of seafood and seasoned perfectly.  At the recommendation of the server Jasc the salmon burger shock came Hoi fresh and blackened.  Def a great place to hit. Bree served us and did a nice job.  It feels a bit pricey on some menu items.
__label__4	Love this dump!!!  Ok it's not pretty, but that's the charm. Great fresh  made to order food. Huge sandwiches. Especially at breakfast. Home made turkey and roast beef. The cooks rock it and it's fun to sit at the counter and watch them do their thing. Nice people Tiny place. If I lived closer I'd be here 3 times a week. Good strong coffee. Run here if your in Manayunk! Located about a mile from Main Street plenty of free parking.
__label__4	The Corned Beef Hash was very good. Great location for people watching. The coffee was excellent as well. Also, cool payment method on iPhones!
__label__4	"Well let me say this was our first visit there ... Tuesday 6-13-17. Before going of course I looked it up on the ""restaurant Red Alert"" site ... cleanliness is # 1, which it was. Food was terrific, service spot on... Tiger was our waiter... couldn't ask for any more...He was knowledgeable/helpful and very patient... KUDOS."
__label__4	My first experience with Saige was good. I had a large pick up and the cashier was friendly and patient. The food is good, they have a large selection to choose from. Their smoothies are decent, no artificial colors or flavors. However the second time the cashier was not as friendly, and forgotten my friend had paid for her food and attempted to charge her twice. Was not crowded so confused how she had forgotten, but everyone has their days.
__label__4	Great alternative to ice cream. Healthy to boot!  Had orange cream.  My son had Banilla Vanana.  No complaints!
__label__4	recently new to sushi but i really enjoyed the food and waitstaff was great. it can get pricey but hell your there to have a good time and the larger portions can be split between several people. remember that there is a full bar and not to get tricked into specialty drinks on the menu. its a trap.
__label__4	Love any bar that has daisy cutter on tap. Good beer selection with exciting upcoming selections on the menu that make you want to come again. There's so many TVs it's perfect for any game (I watched the Warriors Cavs game here) and you can't go wrong with the big pretzel. It's SO GOOD and the dipping sauces are even better. We split the whole thing and we said we weren't that hungry before it came!
__label__4	"Nice Airport.  Fast service, clean.  Not congested .
Some good places to eat. Easy access and great shuttle from rental places"
__label__4	"Practice saying: "" Yummmmm,"" and ""Oh Wow"" before you go. And go you must if you are hankering for something a little different, little exotic, and very gastronomically satisfying. Reasonably priced, beautifully presented, and generous portions all served in impeccably clean surroundings. It's well worth a visit. My only (and very slight) critisim would be that they have one or two more options for vegetarians in your party."
__label__4	Haven't been to NOLA for a awhile and this was just what I was looking for! I had the crab claws and a cup of jambalaya. I wish there were more claws. I also tried the Abit draft which was ok. The waitress was very nice and the restaurant itself was nice. My sis food had to be sent back because the waitress made a mistake. Once it came back out it was lukewarm and that was upsetting. I would probably go again to try shrimp and grits since my daughter mentioned how Awesome they were.
__label__4	"Awesome coffee, delish baked goods, plentiful seating, cheap prices, adorable barristas.  

Love it."
__label__4	My favorite coffee shop in Nashville. A great place to have a lady's brunch. The bagel sandwiches are egg-celent, Pun intended. Service is always great, and they take covid extremely seriously. Customers are spaced out and all the servers are masked.
__label__4	Certainly an experience. A little bit gross, a little bit aggressive, definitely fascinating. Bins have tons of stuff mixed together, mostly junk and trash. Some good toy finds. TONS of clothes and shoes. Much less home and kitchen items comparatively. Furniture is dirt cheap, like $15 for couches or tables, dressers.
__label__4	Their Rueben was sooo good. Don't know why they discontinued it, but glad I got to try it.
__label__4	The restaurant is worth trying at least once there are some excellent dishes. I've been to a few Paula Deens it's always nice to see what they have done with the place always nice interior and really cute gift shop as well. As for the food it's pretty good I would definitely recommend the meatloaf and you can't go wrong with the chicken either. All the deserts are pretty good as for the sides they are good but nothing special. I was a little underwhelmed by the sweet tea on my recent experience considering they are known for sweet tea.
__label__4	Great place with great food. Absolutely delicious. A great  restaurant for a date or lonely dinner ;)
__label__4	In my humble opinion, this Jakes & Cooper's servers up one of the best burgers in Philly. It's served up on a brioche bun, with bubbly Vermont cheddar cheese, caramelized onions and sauteed mushrooms. Also, it comes with a side of ketchup and a side of horseradish aioli so you can slather them atop your burger and also dip in your delicious parmesan fries. Dude, this burger is no joke. It's cooked to perfection, totally juicy and unbelievably delicious.
__label__4	"Catered hoagie trays for a corporate lunch - and it was fine.  Ham, turkey and roastbeef on seeded rolls, lettuce, tomatoes and cheap white American cheese.  (Mayo pre-spread on the turkey hoagie-piece I ate.)

Served with may small bags of Herr's chips.

No issues."
__label__4	I'm a newbie and came in for a fitting and was really impressed with the care and interest shown. Pricing on shoes seemed really reasonable--30% less than I was expecting to pay.
__label__4	"Located in the heart of MidTown, these cleaners are fast, friendly, and no-frills.  I trusted them with a couple of suits, and they came back as...suits (and clean!).

For a quick suit clean, in a convenient location, at a decent price, check these people out!"
__label__4	If dive bars are your thing, The Red Key Tavern is an institution among dives in Indy. I met the Indy chapter of Bourbon Women for a drink here and we had a great time. Nothing fancy, but they knew how to make us feel welcome and pour a stiff Manhattan. It's a cash only spot, and if you are picky about food plan on eating elsewhere, but definitely worth a visit.
__label__4	"I'm only giving this place 4 stars because of Chelsea our bartender!

It was the most decent place to have to drinks and relax with the cool kids so to speak. Didn't try any of the food. but we love Chelsea!"
__label__4	"This place was pretty good. My coworkers and I were in town and a bunch of us went to eat here. They did a great job and the price was good too. 

I would suggest eating here. But I must admit, it wasn't very busy. So who knows."
__label__4	I had a friend introduce to me to the Mud House about a year ago.  It is a very cozy and welcoming little coffee shop in the city.  The coffee is great, my favorite is the turtle.  I was there today and got the gingerbread and it was amazing.  The staff is always friendly. Kacey helped me out today and she was super cute and friendly. I wanted to try a little of the gingerbread and a little of the banana bread and she let me have half slices of each :)  Great place! Check it out!
__label__4	Love Zama! Bestest sushi in the city.
__label__4	Had to wait for a table outside on a Tuesday night.  Easy waiting list setup!  Waiter was very helpful and the meal came out super fast.  I was a little nervous with how fast the food came, but it was very good!  Stuffed grouper was delicious and the jerk sauce was spicy and good!
__label__4	Stopped by for some wings.  Great spot in funk zone, and an interesting Vietnamese inspired menu.  The wings were spectacular!  Nicely fried, not greasy, a touch of heat, with an awesome glaze, hints of fish sauce, garlic and lemongrass and topped with mint and crispy fried onions. Good job!  One of my all-time favorite wings (my all time favorite of course, is San Tung in SF)
__label__4	In a great location in the French Quarter, it was a great choice for fresh seafood.  My friends had oysters, and I had the crab cakes and seafood pasta, which ended up being way too much food.  The crab cakes must have been the best I've ever had!
__label__4	They are always reliable for good wings, today is a game day so we had a small wait, but not bad. Menu is more limited now. Food was out quickly too!
__label__4	"We've been twice and have had a great experience both times, though the dinner menu was far better than when we went for brunch. The Kobe Beef Sliders were amazing as were the gorgonzola potatoes. For dessert we had the espresso flan, and it was delicious. Brunch was good, but it wasn't as amazing as dinner. 

The atmosphere is a mix of funky elegance. It's a really clean and trendy place - perfect for Downtown Dunedin! 

We will be back ... multiple times. :)"
__label__4	I had a light lunch while staying here for 3 days. The French onion soup and BLT salad is wonderful. I have a tea, large salad, and a cup of soup for $21. That's not too bad for a hotel.
__label__4	Always good.
__label__4	This location is currently in its 'soft opening'.  I tried the beef gogi bento box. It was really good.  The portion size was a little small compared to other bento boxes I've had. The decor is really nice, and they plan on having a happy hour when their liquor license is approved.  I'll definitely go back.
__label__4	Spring break vacation on the beach with crowds of high schoolers or college kids (I can't tell the difference) shouting and tossing sand around while throwing (and missing it most of the time) footballs back and forth. Bikini clad babes and guys in board shorts tip toeing into the cooler than comfortable ocean. Watching my great niece playing in the sand at the waters edge while I lay on a towel soaking up much needed rays. Soft sand under my feet and toes. Chatting it up with my sister. Planes trailing ads. Jet skis buzzing by. What a great day on the beach!
__label__4	"Service = 5
Food = 3

Gumbo was very good. Fish was okay. Fried and blackened alligator tail was good."
__label__4	Great Pizza, the sauce was delicious and not too sweet. Good selection of toppings and the delivery guy was cool, they use bikes for delivery apparently so I suppose their range is pretty limited. They didn't use a pizza bag and so my pizza was delivered a little luke warm. Would order again, but recommend they get some pizza bags so I don't have to warm up my pizza in the oven.
__label__4	I really like their beer! The food is decent and one time I had a sandwich where they deep fried the lettuce-kinda weird but good. Parking can be a big pain in the butt! It's a great place to chill with friends but I'd suggest eating somewhere else if you are super hungry.
__label__4	We have been going here for several years. Service is top notch and very professional. The eye exams are quite extensive and prices are fair. They have a large selection of frames and some contact lenses on hand. Very happy with their service.
__label__4	I've been to many Michael's across the country. This one is almost like every other. It may be a little older and maybe not as organized as some. However they offer everything else you find at any other Michael's. The staff here always seems helpful and ready to find what you need.
__label__4	"Nice theater.  Lots of nice waiting area.  I came here to watch beauty and beast at their VIP 21 theater.  

Order your food before you go in the theater and they will deliver.  However they do have a waiter to take orders in the theater but I have not figured out how to do it.  Not like Cinapolis where they have a button to press and call for service.  Nice rocking chairs but not recliners.  For $10 to see a new releases movie , it is not a bad deal."
__label__4	It's pretty much always busy here. It's exactly what you'd expect in the quarter and very similar to a bunch of other restaurants in the quarter. You have to wait in line for about 30 minutes usually, but you can grab a drink from one of the surrounding bars to drink in line. (Have to finish it before you go in) The food is good, the restaurant itself is loud, and the service is quick. I usually end up here if I have friends visiting who want oysters in the quarter.
__label__4	These are so cute and delicious. Got a dozen assorted and I liked every single one of them! The only thing is that they are very expensive so I wont be going anytime soon but from time to time ill have the red velvet mini bundt cupcake
__label__4	"I know this place is highly rated, and been around a long time, but I find it to be just average. It's good enough, but not stellar. To keep it real we had the ""famous"" burgers, and they're okay, but nothing special."
__label__4	This little hidden gem is a must! We couldn't decide what to get for our 8 guests so got a huge assortment and every bite of everything we picked was fought over ! Delicious all around ! Awesome tasty Donuts & the flakiest pastry ! Yummy
__label__4	Ultra thin pizza at s great price! Haven't been here for years. Place stays open late.  Till 4am.
__label__4	Xochitl was so chic with a great looking restaurant! The menu was full of great options that could accommodate anyone! The waitress was very friendly and attentive to our table. We started with the trio (queso, guacamole, & salsa) which was very yummy and my table all agreed the guacamole was the best out of the three! I had the bowl which was full of flavor and enough to bring home for a second meal. I would definitely go back to this restaurant!
__label__4	I went to clover market today with my dog. It was busy but not too crowded! It is a great place to walk around and lots of people stopped to say hello to my dog. There were some beautiful jewelry vendors and food trucks. Park in the parking lot by cricket avenue.
__label__4	Went in for the first time just the other day, had the turkey pesto sandwich. The service was awesome, sandwich was pretty damn good. Looking to try the grilled cheese next time I go in. Location looks clean and inviting, however parking is tough to find, but the food quality and the service make it well worth the hassle.
__label__4	"When traveling, its always a problem choosing a haircutter on the road. 
But, I happened to be in this strip mall and there was no line and took a chance with a $15 cut and was pleasantly surprised.  Was lucky to get Bo; he was pleasant and was skilled enough to use scissors.  Thanks."
__label__4	After forgetting about my oil change for an extra ohhh 3,000 miles or so I finally got around to it yesterday. Unfortunately, everyone in South County was also at Gravois Auto Repair! As I quickly found out, Monday is typically their busiest day (go Wednesday or Thursday instead). I paid $18 for an oil change and was there for roughly an hour. Definitely be prepared to wait-the guy next to me waited 90 minutes for an oil change. Also, bring change ... the very limited vending machine is change only.
__label__4	Rescue is a rare breed in Philadelphia.  It has a wonderful array of spa services, but in a small, somewhat cozy day-spa environment.  I always joke that Rescue is the only spa people recommend . . . I honestly think its because its one of the only places people feel comfortable . . . which translates to relaxed.
__label__4	Great atmosphere. The food was really good. It was my first time. And I'm looking forward to taking my husband real soon.
__label__4	The food was really good not huge portions for the price but worth it! It is a candlelit type atmosphere so it is a little on the dark side.
__label__4	Visited on a recommendation, while on my honeymoon last week. Lovely decor and ambiance. Their bread is outstanding! Ordered the shrimp crepes and they were delicious. I enjoyed my diablo cocktail very much. It was recommended we go there to learn about the resident ghost, by way of the bartender and see the seance room. The bartender seemed annoyed that we were interested in the story. He really wasn't very personable at all which was a bummer. My husband and I did go upstairs and out on the balcony, which was a lovely experience. Great photo ops too!
__label__4	Fabulous atmosphere, great sandwiches, excellent wine list.  Can't wait to go back!!!
__label__4	"Great spot for some good BBQ. Be aware that they get pretty busy at lunch time. The line was actually out the door with people waiting (noon on Friday), but the line moved faster than I expected and the food was ready pretty quickly.

I had the ""more cowbell"" sandwich. IT WAS GREAT! The brisket was super juicy and I could have drank the horseradish sauce. 

Check it out. It's worth the trip."
__label__4	"I've been dreaming of eating the spicy tuna guacamole again...it was just incredible. Perfectly cut into small cubes.. it was heaven in an oval shaped dish. 

I was excited about the menu..(such as the Korean tacos, Carnitas steamed buns, fried plaintains..) The second dish I tried was the Brussels sprout leaf tacos. The leaves were crisp, and there was a big heaping pile of them. I love how creative this restaurant got with this dish, simple ingredients, but executed so well."
__label__4	"Ugly rainy day so we sat inside.  The area was packed but food comes quick.

Grab a menu (in basket near window) and order at window.

There is a nice, large patio area for sunny days.

Mimosas are great!

I had the poached egg with avocado, jalapeños and some kind of cheese, maybe feta on delicious wheat bread, my husband had to Yolo.  Everything was great!

Fantastic breakfast and super filling!"
__label__4	Best airport hotel joint I've ever seen.   Really good food, friendly service, nice crowd and decent draft beer list.   Lots of flat screens too, and can that ever be bad.
__label__4	My husband and I have been eating at this same location for 7 years. Food has always been good, the happy hour margaritas are on point (for under 5$??) and service has been good. We always sit with the same person (we are here so much we know who the best is!). No complaints here besides the prices continue to rise often and it's pretty expensive now.. They also offer a monthly coupon which is usually 6$ off two adult entrees.
__label__4	Pleasant little spot for breakfast. I may be kicked out of NJ for saying this but  Amy's is a nice change the tattered overpriced diners in the area. The pigs-in-a-blanket were made with light fluffy pancakes and delicious sausage. The coffee was good and the service was attentive.
__label__4	Wonderful place excellent food can't wait to go back for dinner.This place is just like a jersey diner the food is awesome the menu is huge and the plates are overloaded.I had the eggs Benedict very good could have been hotter though.Hubby had the 5 cheese omlette with a huge bowl of grits and we shared a side of bacon and a huge pancake.I must say that they had the best bacon ever and the pancakes were to die for.We will be back for dinner the burgers looked awesome.
__label__4	Great decor.  The pork sandwich and fires was yummy.  Lots of flavor.  The wings were o.k.  Happy hour is limited $3 draft and $5 wine.  But  no happy hour prices for food.. We sat in the bar area in the window seat.  Great for people watching. The girl bartender was great and gave us the attention we needed. However, next time we will check out the patio area in back.  We are also looking forward to the opening of the rooftop bar that opens in September.
__label__4	"Basic standard hotel right on the beach.
Rooms are clean and has frig and microwave.
Beach front Deluxe rooms are the best for the view of course.
Nice little pool refreshing and pool bar."
__label__4	So far very good service and reasonable oil change prices. I usually pay $29.99 and sometimes they would mail me a check of $15 to go towards the oil change. Plus the military discount makes it reasonable and cheaper than doing it myself. The convenience.  Good lounge area to hang out for 30-75mins of your time while your car is being serviced. Never bought a car here so I don't know what the salesmen are like. Sharks? These new Honda's do look great but I like my 2014 Accord Touring. Best Accord out there.
__label__4	Pedicure chairs and actually pedicure was awesome! Gel manicure was good and she applied 3 coats! My only complaint was the nail polish was not a well known brand....I hope my gel manicure doesn't chip. Great service and they followed all social distancing rules. I will def be back!!!
__label__4	Hehehehehehehe. The Honey Pot was one stop in my engagement/birthday party night. The drag show was awesome, the staff was even better and the atmosphere was so fun!
__label__4	Disappointed by the overall average stars of this place. These guys bust their butts all day regardless of weather. They do a great job for a hand car wash. The gas prices are always low and for an interior exterior wash it's about $17 which is reasonable compared to their competitors down the street who charged me $23 for the same thing.
__label__4	This is an excellent burger bar. The waiting staff and ambiance is great. Prices are a little high for burgers but, I still love the place. It is very small, so be prepared to wait. I usually order off the custom menu. No matter what you order you will not be disappointed. This is a great little restaurant in a decent south city neighborhood.
__label__4	great little place in broad ripple. nothing fancy, nothing too simple, just good food. they have a fantastic wine list and the beer cheese is to die for. I had a steak special, which was nothing exciting (still excellent), but everyone elses food off the main menu was fantastic. Will def. go back
__label__4	I love the lunch special and they seem to have expanded their menu recently. I particularly enjoy the chicken massaman curry though it could be a wee bit spicier.  Overall a pleasant place in an area with fewer Thai restaurants than one would think.
__label__4	I've only been once but so far so good. drinks were great service was friendly and attentive and their pizza is fantastic. We will definitely be back.
__label__4	Visit! Really enjoyed the wine and conversation. The credit card payment process basically forces you to tip what it suggests, versus what you would prefer.
__label__4	If you like Vodka, this is definitely the place to come. Bartenders are super friendly and the atmosphere is hip. Drinks are a bit pricey but absolutely on point. The tour is an excellent way to learn about their distilling process.
__label__4	Had the deviled eggs and NY bagel.  The food was quite good and the place was jumping and appeared to be very popular.
__label__4	Super packed!! Good music! Had to visit because Don and Brooke go to the Spotted Cat for NYE!!
__label__4	Great food and great service. I didn't go eat here till a few years ago and wish I went sooner
__label__4	This is my second time staying at this hotel. Both times my experience in the rooms have been overall good. Experience with staff has been decent as well. I'd recommend this if you're staying overnight after getting out of the airport or if you're staying the night for an early flight.
__label__4	Come for the lobsters, stay for the prime rib and friendly service. Price is a little high but they do let you take 2 lobsters max at a time.
__label__4	"Malls are becoming a thing of the past, so their upkeep and selection of stores inside are dwindling. Do I regularly shop at malls? No. However, sometimes you just need or want to, and your other options left in the area are Rivergate or Cool Springs, so Opry Mills is the obvious winner. After the Great Flood of 2010 and renovation, Opry has remained as a nice and clean place to buy things you will probably want to return next week.

Best part: their theater has reclining seats!"
__label__4	I ordered the chicken Tiki masala. The red sauce was very sweet and was not spicy at all. Like a sweet pizza sauce almost. Chicken was also somewhat dry and overcooked. The appetizer however as well as the scallion chili naan bread and my friends dish all of were delicious so I'm still going to give this establishment four stars.
__label__4	Minimal styling and clean. Menu was simple but many choices. The Santa Isabela was pretty nice.
__label__4	Private room available with big round tables seating 10-12 people. If you spent $100 per table you get karaoke free for 3 hours
__label__4	Solid Chinese take-out spot. Stick with classics and you wont be disappointed.
__label__4	This is the kind of place that can either by depressing or awesome - I think it would mostly depend on your mood/state of mind. I found myself totally digging the chill, dark and bare-bones bar feel of it. Plus, our hot server was really attentive, funny and totally engaging, which really helps when you're surrounded by sad, frown-faced old dudes with scotch on the rocks.
__label__4	Pappone's has been a great surprise. We were craving a Sicilian pizza which ended up being incredible- the only issue if I had to be picky would be that it was a tiny bit dry. We both said more sauce would have made it perfect! So consider asking for a side of sauce :)
__label__4	Enjoyed the coffee and friendly service. Kind of funky, in a Burning Man kind of way. They have music nights, but haven't been able to attend yet.
__label__4	Stopped in on a Sunday afternoon got a little table out by the canal with a view of a few docked shrimp boats.  We ordered crab cakes, peel and eat shrimp and calamari.  Food was decent and service was good.  Nice enough place but would choose a different location if you're looking for a nice water view.
__label__4	The pork banh mi was delicious as was the crab melt. Our hands down favorite, however,  was the tri- tip fried rice! We enjoyed great take out on the cusp of the dinner/late night menu and though we would have liked to have tried options from the finner menu, our options did not disappoint.  Service was a bit slow on the ordering side of things thus the missed opportunity for the fuller menu options. Other than that we, fully enjoyed our meal!
__label__4	After reading about their bloody Mary's with grilled cheese side, I wanted to check it out. The drink was good but the side was only 1/4 of a sandwich. If you look at the pic in the RN &R, it looks like more than than a small piece.
__label__4	The new menu is truly great. Had a salad with Salmon, the greens were out of this world!
__label__4	Of the Starbucks in the surrounding area this one is the best! I will go to this one any day because they are nice, clean, quick and they seem to care.
__label__4	This cute little place was the perfect stop following our beautiful drive up Mt. Lemmon. The chocolate chip cookie was so soft and delicious and I had the perfect cup of coffee. I wish we would have tried more food, everything being brought out looked great just couldn't justify the prices so -1 star.
__label__4	"I'm obsessed with this place.  I love all of the furniture. Prices are high (or it would be 5 stars).  They have a great floral department and a framing department. 

Highly recommend this store!"
__label__4	I've had some really great massages here. I've been to about 6 different therapists for deep tissue or hot stone massages and all of them have been really good.
__label__4	I really enjoy living here. The community is so nice and the staff are top notch! I really appreciate how responsive the management team is and would recommend it to any of my friends
__label__4	The food is absolutely delicious. We came late afternoon but you could tell they were understaffed, the poor waitress was running around trying to make sure everyone got service. If you have kids and you're looking for something outside of the Denny's realm then come here to get your daily servings of fruit. I had the asparagus and swiss cheese eggs benedict. My little brother had an enormous waffle. The kids sized waffle is big enough for an adult. A little on the pricey side.
__label__4	They sell only chicken finger.  I order the 8 piece combo which came with 8 chicken fingers with cane sauce, crinkle thin french fries, cole slaw , toasted butter bread and drink.  I didn't notice an option for side orders or non-combo orders unless it was a kids meal.  The food was very good. I can't tell you how the coke slaw is because I don't eat Cole slaw
__label__4	Great location near our hotel and the beach.  The grouper and calamari were fantastic!  We enjoyed this place very much!
__label__4	Great Baby Back Ribs. Their baked beans are delicious. My kids love to eat here but is a little expensive for 4 people every week. Just a once every couple of months for us. Wait staff is so-so never had real bad of great service. If you like ribs I would give it a try.
__label__4	I was in desperate need of new jeans. I didn't want another cheap pair from Target, but I just can't spend the money on the nice, expensive jeans. A coworker suggested I give The Toggery a shot, and I had success on my first trip! Two pairs a great, designer jeans for a total of $41 (you get a discount by checking in on Yelp, too!). The store is well organized (as many second-hand stores can be cluttered), and sections are clearly labeled. I'll be going back!
__label__4	Great food and fast delivery service. Recently moved to the area and was starving after a big move. The cheesesteak and buffalo wings hit the spot.
__label__4	"This Ross is pretty good. The other Ross's in the area consist if Zephyrhills and Land O Lakes.

This time around there was barely any clearance racks. That was sad. Where did they all go?

I like shopping in their shoes, clothes, home, and doggie stuff. So many interesting finds here.

They also keep up on their holiday decor which is quite cute."
__label__4	"Totally fun!!!

I went in a weekday afternoon, paid the $10 all day fee and played till my hands hurt!

Tons of pinball!!

So many classic arcade games!

It's in a sketchy strip mall but totally worth it!"
__label__4	Really solid restaurant. If we lived in the area, this would become a weekly stop. Very reasonable prices and good quality food. The bar area is comfortable and accessible. We ate dinner during family weekend at Villanova and it was the first week open. They were still working out some kinks with the service. Super attentive. Fried Chicken sandwich, burger and Brussel Sprouts. The baked Brie bread was a good starter. We will go back when we visit our Nova student.
__label__4	My daughter and I had dinner here on a Tuesday night in August.  She had the Lion Burger and I had a wedge salad.  She said her burger was excellent, and she is a hard critic.  My salad was quite good also.  It was not particularly busy so our waiter was able to pay a great deal of attention to us.  They had a nice cocktail list which is always appealing to me.  Would definitely return.
__label__4	This store is a life-saver. I buy low cost tea-tree oil from the pharmacy, lowest price anywhere.  And I love the one-stop nature of the products offered. Convenient and great hours.  Parking is a bit challenging, though.
__label__4	Service was great, and food + drinks were pretty good. However, ridiculous wait. 2 hour 20 min wait for party of two and tbh it wasn't a unique experience that you couldn't get anywhere else. Wouldn't go back, but I'm glad I tried it.
__label__4	"Good experience. Lots of good vegan and gluten-free options. Had the black bean tacos and they were good. Salsa was excellent. Peanut butter and banana smoothie was excellent.

Atmosphere was cool. A little loud, but we didn't have any problems hearing each other at our table.

Service was good. Must have been there during a shift change, because we had at least three different people wait on us during our meal. All were very nice.

Looking forward to going back again!"
__label__4	Best dining option in the area by far.  You would expect to find this place in South Tampa, great food, unique twists on traditional dishes, always a good time.  Very helpful waitstaff as well.  My wife and I go here when we can afford it. :)
__label__4	Still the best Cuban and media noche (Cuban on sweet bread which I prefer) in town but the meat was still cold in middle and cheese was cold.  Wish they would have been a little warmer.  The plantains have been better.  Still good flavor but didn't seem freshly cooked today.  Kinda tough and chewy.  Usually they are the best of anywhere I have ever had them.   Hopefully today was a fluke because this is usually one of nashvilles best kept secrets!
__label__4	Pretty nice bar! I had the Diva Martini and it was great! The ambiance is nice. They have some social distancing policies in place. Service is nice!
__label__4	Excellent place for Dosas which is a fried savory Indian crepe. I tried the Mysore masala dosa, the Chicken Tikka masala dosa as well as the oothappam. The kids choice of meal at a South Indian restaurant is an oothappam. It looks like a pizza for them and once it is sliced into 8 portions they don't complain and gobble it up without any fuss.
__label__4	Enjoyed this place.  We tried a variety of their bowls.  Their water bowl is like deconstructed sushi, the bowls are like deconstructed sushi over lettuce.  Very creative.  Staff was not the most responsive and service was slow but the food made up for it.
__label__4	Stopped for lunch, sat at the bar.  Good ambiance, service was great. Order Palermo Chicken - lemon, capers, olives...it was very good.  Next time coming back for dinner.
__label__4	What can I say Cosco has it all from housewares to food business supplies computer even an eyeglass center, its like a one-stop shopping place but yet every time I come in here I never leave without spending under hundred dollars. I guess it could be a good and bad thing but at least I'm stocked up. Always friendly staff and people willing to assist you. And who doesn't like getting a supreme pizza for only 995 fresh!!
__label__4	Very good red sauce Italian place.  The spaghetti tasted homemade, and the meatball was very good.  The tomato sauce definitely needed the salty pop of added parm.  All 7 of us liked what we got, but what raised this to a 4 star review was the fact that the cannoli was probably the best I've ever had.  Amazingly rich, thick, smooth and flavorful filling was piped into the shell right before it was brought to the table.  The tiramisu was also very, very good.
__label__4	"Ever feel lazy and just want another human to make you a super basic breakfast?

Yes. Always -- why Central coffee is perfect. No frills, just really good breakfast food in diner style and an *interesting* clientele/staff."
__label__4	Stopped in for a bite to eat on a recent outing at lunch time.  Place was not crowded, all our food, standard fare was out promptly.  Friendly server, drinks kept full while we we eating.  Portions seemed a little small, but worked out fine as we didn't walk out of the restaurant completely stuffed.
__label__4	Very good! Got the Fat Dan's Burger and a side of the beer cheese fries... so good! My husband is a huge fan of this type of food, I can't wait to take him there! We were shocked with the service though... out server would come to our table then disappear to the bar for 15 min or so.. we almost had to ask another server to take our order because we were starving! Hoping for a better server experience next time!
__label__4	Nice hotel, nice rooms, great atmosphere in the lobby.  We were staying at the Marriott during the BCS Championship weekend. While the place was over-run all weekend long, everyone did a good job.  Only complaint would be the air conditioning never got cold enough - not really dinging them for that since we didn't request maintenance.
__label__4	Very good hot dogs, highly recommend the Hawaiian. The only thing holding me back from giving this a 5-star review is their doordash ordering options did not include French fries unless you upgraded the dog to a combo, and even then the French fries were unseasoned and I would actually say below average. But what it lacks in fries definitely makes up for with hotdog. Desserts weren't an option at all. Very limited door dash options. Otherwise food was good.
__label__4	"I really like this concept. The menu is focused and the ingredients are high quality. Its a great alternative to typical ""fast food"" and I really like the fancy soda fountain as well. I've only been in here twice but every time the service has been good and friendly."
__label__4	"Count me as a big fan.

I guess they've been getting slammed every day and tonight was no exception.  They looked a little understaffed  but the food came out eventually.

Great burger - the toasted bun really sets off a tasty burger.  The b&b pickles are a nice compliment to the rest of the sammich and the mannez bar is very fresh tasting.  

Nice selection of beers including NOLA and I just noticed they serve sazeracs!

Great pickled jalapenos.

Not a bad value at $6.50 for a single."
__label__4	Very nice, homey atmosphere inside. Clean, vibrant, and warm. I will say though, for $12, I was hoping to get a little more food. One small enchilada, one tiny burrito, and rice and beans and I still left hungry. That usually doesn't happen! This was one of their dinner menu items; at this portion size it seemed more fitting for lunch. I would certainly come back here if the portion sizes were larger.
__label__4	Follow up; I went to pick up my car and it looked absolutely amazing!! There are some scratched parts under the hood, bumper has a gap, and roof is scratched up a bit but nothing we can't address. Ken was apologetic for the initial experience which is admirable. I am truly amazed about the work they have done! At this point I am thinking maybe we just had a rough start:) amazing work everyone!! Thank you
__label__4	I stayed last weekend and enjoyed my stay. The rooms are OK. Staff friendly. This is not a fine hotel by any means but location is great and I didn't see any cock roaches so this was good!  Overall, on the pricey side for what you got but it was Halloween weekend so everyone raises the prices. I would stay there again.
__label__4	This place never disappoints from the great food to the awesome crafted cocktails it is just an enjoyable experience from the job! I would recommend it to anyone in the area who likes off the wall food and great cocktails. The bartenders can be a bit pretentious but it's manageable after a couple of cocktails. Pretty much every flat bread and hamburger that they have is fantastic.
__label__4	"Food was good. Didn't take long to get our order. Had the brisket tacos which were delicious! Also had the burnt ends that were on top of grits. Very tasty but the grits were very lumpy. Had to try the smoked sausage which was real good as well but it's served with ""pimento"" cheese but it's more like cream cheese with pimientos than real pimento cheese. All in all it's worth a try. We'll be back to try more menu items!"
__label__4	Love this place i highly recommend that u spend time here to see what i have during on vac. I cant wait to visit again
__label__4	The coffee here is pretty good and the service is okay.  I've only had coffee here a few times and a bottled water another time but the cashiers seem rather friendly and there is usual ample seating.  Price wise, they're pretty much on point.  I'll probably be back.
__label__4	"This is a pretty small gas station which also has a garage. Gas prices are usually a bit high but it's the only pump around, so that's to be expected.

They get +1 star for the absurdity of Shell Fest...which is a party in the gas station parking lot during Jazz Fest. You can pay big bucks to park here and then party away the rest of the evening...in a gas station parking lot.  I must admit, I've only ever wandered by the party since I was usually hell bent for a shower by the time I left the fairgrounds."
__label__4	Hit and miss.  Love the beef cold noodle bowl and the pho is great.  Standard Chinese dishes are pedestrian, but I love the a few dishes there.
__label__4	"Living on the west side, I'm willing to frequent any decent restaurants. If it happens to be Asian, then I'm going to be a regular.  I don't know how I missed this place all these years.  My first dish, Tan Tan Ramen with pork. It is spicy unlike typical Japanese dishes. I liked it ok. Decent. Spicy rich broth. I can feel my nose beginning to run...

We need more restaurants on the west side. One of these days. Btw the price = 12.95+tip+taxes."
__label__4	Walk-in appointment after I couldn't get into my regular salon. Staff was friendly and attentive. They had a few suggestions that were helpful when I inquired about a certain style. They didn't rush the process as some salons do. Nails look great. Will return.
__label__4	Definitely a great place in Goleta to get a poke bowl. But the price I saw on yelp was way old and they probably raised the price already, I remembered I saw a large with 5 scoops but they changed to 4. But still a really nice place to go to.
__label__4	"Atmosphere was nice very laid back. I went for lunch and I ordered the salmon salad, it was delightful very fresh the portion size was just the right amount. 
Server was alright nothing to rave about and there's parking on the street.
I will be visiting again!"
__label__4	It's not that bad as everyone says it doesn't take very long for the food to be prepared. Although the servers mainly the girls show where something more appropriate but I think this place should have a 4.5 but you all know points isn't allowed. This restaurant is pretty much the bomb.
__label__4	"Consistent, fresh, good quality.
Great for company lunch catering."
__label__4	"Really awesome. This place kicked off my
Mardi gras in a big way and everything was delicious. Food came out quick, service was great and po-boys (roast beef, peacemaker, catfish/oyster) were all amazing. So were the chargilled oysters. Definitely a must do and worth the wait"
__label__4	Went here for lunch one day with coworkers. We found the place from St. Louis Post Dispatch Ian Froeb's top 100 list. From the moment we walked in, I could tell the restaurant was authentic. The service was fast to get our order and bring our food, but no one came to refill our drinks or check on us. My Torta Ahogada was great. The pork tip was juicy and flavorful and the spicy sauce on top had a fantastic flavor. I would go back again.
__label__4	"This place is awesome! 
Lovely ambience, low lighing. Good cocktails!
I had the best arugula salad with fresh peaches and red wine vinaigrette! :-)

For the main course, I ordered the lamb pasta and hubby got the lamb souvlaki and they both were cooked beautifully!
I would have like the meat on the lamb skewers to be a little more tender, but the spice level was good. 
Will definitely return soon for more :-)"
__label__4	"Loved this place. At first the owner seemed a bit short tempered but then he was professional and caring towards my Princess. They honored my military discount. The baby looked fabulous. His employees were sweethearts as well. 

The only reason why I don't give it 5 stars is because parking sucked. If you have an appointment you would either have to leave earlier so your not late, have to double park, or park at no parking zone. I guess that's pretty much the city lifestyle is and Girard is becoming that tho is on the other side of town."
__label__4	I went here for The Bounce with a girlfriend during the Summer. I overall liked the atmosphere and the music selection (Albeit Tuesday I'm in Love being more my scene...) aside from the stage-five clinger I met on the dancefloor and rude hipsters. Definitely took advantage of that 2 hour open bar.
__label__4	Stop then only because I call my daughter Dot dot and found the place to have a great atmosphere my wife had the corn shrimp soup and thought it was wonderful
__label__4	I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich again, this time completely sober (just a little hungover)... and it was just as good as I remembered it!  Freshly baked roll, pesto and arugula, side of their amazing fries... yumm.  Oddly it seemed a lot smaller than I remembered it... but lots of things seem bigger when I'm drunk ;)
__label__4	"Love the pizza deal. 2 large pies and a 2 liter bottle of soda v for $20

it's tough to get a decent pizza around here this to me at least is the best around"
__label__4	"I went with my wife and our (almost) 2 year old. We were the only ones there so our daughter could run around. 
They don't have a kids menu but they do have fried chicken strips and plain rice.
The food is pretty good. My wife and I both had the pad Thai"
__label__4	"I stopped here after a movie at the High Pointe and ordered a milkshake and fries. This milkshake was the special with Strange Donuts and omg WOW I'm not even a donut fan and I loved it! It had chunks of chocolate donut in it and I watched the employee make it saw each fresh ingredient go in!

The French fries were mediocre but the fry sauce was 100%!

Looking forward to coming back for a full meal."
__label__4	I went to get a couple slices for dinner, cashier was super nice and pizza got the job done. Looking at the slices they look pretty average but they were surprisingly flavorful and fresh. 2 dolla happy hour slices always clutch! I cant believe that shitty taco shop and subway are taking up such prime real-estate downtown we need more places like this!
__label__4	This is my go to place when I'm in town. I love the tomato soup, the butt sandwich, the salads are all excellent. The music is always a surprise and never disappointing. Quick service and welcoming, laid back ambiance.
__label__4	Very popular and trendy brewery in Dunedin. Fun atmosphere. Can be a bit loud. There is a back room on the side that's worth a try. The beers and the food are good. Thissuccess of this brewery helped build momentum for the others opping up around the area. They have live music performances. The crowd tends to be pretty hipster. There are some fund beers to try and the offerings change pretty often.
__label__4	We bought a 2018 Toyota Highlander from Dolan Toyota. We found the inventory to be plentiful and the sales process, although it was typical, it was fairly easy. If we buy another car, we'd see Dolan again. I'd recommend them.
__label__4	"Great place, but too often I've parked, fed the meter and gotten the ""back at 2"" sign, only to wait til 3 and still nothin'."
__label__4	I've been to a couple burger joints in the Reno area, but none like Scoopers. The only complaint is the customer service was awful because the young lady who attended us was rude and spoke very low which made us feel uncomfortable just ordering and she even had our order wrong.
__label__4	They don't lie, the portions are enormous, and the quality of the food was a cut above regular diner fare.  We had biscuits and gravy which was tasty and filling.  We also had the huevous rancheros which tasted good but was not prepared in a traditional manner.  It is basically nachos with eggs on top.  If you like nachos you will enjoy it but if you want huevous rancheros we would not reccomend it.  The service was very good and employees worked together well to provide diners with an enjoyable experience.
__label__4	I enjoy all the food from the burgers, pizza, chicken fingers and delicious chili! They make great mixed drinks. Definitely a nice hole in the wall to have a relaxing evening.
__label__4	Love love love. This place always makes me happy. Fast good, unique and classic tacos to chose from.
__label__4	"Fun place. I stay here every year or two. Even if I live in town.

Pluses are:

Huge pool

Big arcade

Nice rooms

Good food

Fun atmosphere.

Draw back is, EVERYTHING is pricey. Especially for Reno.

Low budget eat elsewhere or bring snacks."
__label__4	"Small dark bar with several bar stools and tables. Food was fast, hot and tasted great. Service good to ok. The bar tender with the low cut ""tip cleavage"" shirt does it all except for the cook in the back."
__label__4	I have been passing this place for years. Never stopped in, but wondering how does this place remain open.. Doesn't look like much going on there.. Recently, I decided to stop in late one night, and it was standing room only. Plenty of craft beer on tap, a decent bar menu, and great music playing.. The crowd was a mixed bag of young and middle aged people, all having the same great time.. This spot won't go unnoticed from here on when I have some times to kill and I'm passing by...
__label__4	Hadn't been here in a long time and I was very pleasantly surprised with the revamped menu. Everything was delicious and fresh. I especially enjoyed the avocado toast.
__label__4	"Man, I miss ordering ramen from here! It wasn't elaborate but it had everything you need for a delicious bowl (or two- portion is huge!) of ramen. It was perfect when you wanted to order something warm to bring home on a cold night.

I miss living so close to you ban bamboo!"
__label__4	I always love this truck! The falafel is so crunchy and delicious and if you get the platter or sandwich it is a lot of food! The service is quick and friendly. My falafel sandwich came on a pita with lettuce, tomato, and I believe a yogurt sauce. Check out this truck next time you see it out!
__label__4	Fabulous, Fabulous! It's all about the bread too. Glad you moved in our area. Lilly and staff are very customer oriented and genuine!
__label__4	I came here on a Sunday to calm, quiet, but not empty venue that honestly had good food variety and awesome tacos! I ordered the asada con pico and it honestly hit the spot. I got 2 chicken tacos they were both amazing! not a bad price on anything its definitely a good stop. Also the salsa was on point. wpuld like it to be thicker or an option but hey it was still good!
__label__4	I went here to get my nails done today and everyone was very friendly. Henry did my full set and he did a really good job, he took the time to make sure he got my nails exactly how I wanted. I recommend him for a full set. The salon was pretty clean and the prices are decent I recommend this nail salon!
__label__4	I love Halloween.  Busch Gardens doesn't decorate like Universal Studios does but it was fun.  I'd go again.
__label__4	The food was pretty good, but the drinks? Soooo yummy. Very nice atmosphere. Friendly staff. We will be back.
__label__4	Had some friends over and thought I would try this place out.  We ordered 3 specialty pizzas (all size large) and the total only came to $34!  What a deal.  AND they were very tasty.  The white pizza we ordered was slathered in garlic and it was a big hit.  The veggie pie was loaded with toppings.  We will be ordering again soon.
__label__4	Enjay's Pizza you are most certainly awesome, I had a spectacular experience here today. Friendly service, welcoming atmosphere. Every single menu item that we purchased was very fresh and flavorful. Bonus that their service is so really good, they are so swift and friendly. Def will be returning.
__label__4	The girl we stayed with recommended a coffee shop, but I could tell she didn't know anything about coffee, so I asked the Internet and this is the shop it led me to. I wish they did pour over style iced coffee but what can u do?? the cold brew Burundi tastes good to me.
__label__4	"Airport

I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by Tampa International - a small but well executed airport.

The entire thing has maybe 15 gates and the entire terminal is clean and modern - all new shops, kiosks where you can work on your laptop and cell phone without everyone listening and watching and enough shops and food choices to keep you occupied until your flight is ready to go.

Clean bathrooms and well placed signage and sparkly clean waiting areas- top notch from start to finish!"
__label__4	"Typical American fare.

Came in for a late lunch following my NPC morning show with very few customers. I had requested that they package up a glass of wine to go, and the waiter filled it to the top for me. Chose the burger, medium well, with no cheese. Tomato jam was very tart and thick, and the patty itself was cooked to perfection. Patty was juicy, the bun was soft--I left a happy camper with my wine in hand!"
__label__4	Did they reset all the comments? The doctor's are good and show professional conduct.
__label__4	"Finally, a real representation of what Bahama Breeze has to offer- yum! Had the ""Taste of Jamaica"" and it was delicious! http://m.bahamabreeze.com/menu/taste-of-jamaica/prod2940015. I'm glad that I was able to go back to this location after 4 years of missed opportunities to do so."
__label__4	"Very nice sales reps.... has grocery but doesn't have fresh grocery - just milk, cheese and rest is frozen. 

Otherwise I love target's consistancy in making the stores similar... so happy this was here by my hotel.

Has a Starbucks inside also."
__label__4	Very cool place. Sat at the bar and had their stone crab and peel and eat shrimp. Jessica was a great bartender!! Will be back when I'm in town
__label__4	The fresh squeezed OJ was the best... food was basic.... they needed  more help.... long wait times too...
__label__4	The fried flounder was to die for. Chicken Orzo soup was excellent. All around a good place to eat.
__label__4	Great flavor! Extra cheese pizza was no doubt extra cheese. Sometimes just straight up extra cheese hits the spot and really let's you taste the flavors in the sauce. They delivered to our room on the 4th of July and we ate pizza and watched fireworks on the beach. Delivery dude was very nice and timely! Thanks ya'll.
__label__4	This place is not bad! We had sushi delivered through Yelp. The delivery was super quick and the driver was friendly. The food was packaged nicely. There was plenty of sushi, it was too much to eat. The fish was fresh. The shrimp tempura roll was really good. I would have thought with all the sushi we ordered, we would have gotten a free soup or something. That's my only complaint. Overall it was decent. Nothing to write home about, but nothing to complain about.
__label__4	Really cute bar situated in downtown Santa Barbara. I did not sit inside where the pianos are at, but sat outside (outside seating/patio area is available right on the street post Covid). Really fun atmosphere, able to grab a drink and listen to live music, as well as people watch. Plenty of standing heaters available for when it's chilly outside. Only downfall was there is no food offered; so you can only stay so long.
__label__4	Classy space/place to enjoy great food.  Dimly lit ambiance and decor makes the experience one to remember, whether you're with family or on a date.  Portions aren't big, but quality mattered more.  Not to mention Spencer was an amazing waiter!  He was patient, knowledgeable, pleasant, entertaining, and attentive.  Another visit is on the horizon.
__label__4	Awesome space. And great staff. Everyone feels like a big family. Very welcoming. The steak is amazing. They also sell meat, highly recommend.
__label__4	Came in while walking around State st and needed a treat! I got the crepe with banana and Nutella. It was pretty good! I loved that the crepe had parts that were crispy! I originally wanted banana and strawberry but that one is much bigger. It would be nice to have standard size with a small amount of banana and strawberries. Overall it was delicious!
__label__4	One of the friendliest and genuinely nice shops!! The owner helped me pick the right comic book present.
__label__4	"This place was super cute! If you are planning to decorate your house in any kind of beach theme, you can find all sorts of ideas / knick knacks / furniture here. 
I left with a $30 jewelry box that looks like the ocean, as well as $7.50 for 2 car aroma hangers that say 'Not all those who wander are lost' and have the 'ocean' smell.
It's not overly expensive in the way some smaller shops can be, which was a pleasant surprise, and they don't skimp in the cute department either.
I'll definitely be back!"
__label__4	A new place for us here in Delaware. Great menu and delicious. Secure credit card payment at the table just like in Europe. Kudos to friendly staff who worked with us: Jordan, Tom, and Isaac.
__label__4	We loved this place pre-quarantine, and ordered takeout while under stay-at-home orders--the food was as good as ever! Our order was on time, and I'm so glad they are doing ok. If you like Thai or Vietnamese food, please give them a try!
__label__4	This is such an easy and friendly place to eat. Highly recommend the sake taster board. The chicken buns are a great appetizer.
__label__4	"This place reminds me of home  It's different to the 1 back home but still great. I had the cheesecake fantasy which had bits of fruit & waffle chunks.
Great view to the river outside.
Service was efficient."
__label__4	I was pretty hungry when I stopped at this place. They have a variety of food. I tried one of their popular dishes which was very good, delicious.
__label__4	A good local place to grab a coffee or their excellent iced green tea. It can get crowded abut 9:30 on weekdays when the local offices head over for their coffee break, but it is always clean and the staff pleasant. There is free Wi-Fi and a little patio that is usually filled with smokers.
__label__4	Excellent service, excellent food, excellent atmosphere. I had the Eggs Jonathan, and it did not disappoint. Took off a star because the plate was not piping hot. The home fries were not as good as the grits. This place has been around since 1894, for good reason. We're only in NOLA for 3 days, but are considering a return trip because the lunch/dinner menu looked so good!
__label__4	Must see tourist spot in French Quarter. Hurricane is very sugary so not my cup of tea. Nice vibe and atmosphere, great bartenders.
__label__4	Great stuff at even better prices!  Lots of decorative items to search and purchase here - but it is a hunt.  Related to TJ Maxx - its pretty much teh same feel/concept.
__label__4	"Very unique spot. Came here with a friend and sat at the bar. I only had a french onion soup which was great, but I have to say that I was impressed with the beer selection, the decor, and the service.
I cant wait until I'm in the area again so I can come back and try this place again!"
__label__4	Wonderful local gastropub in St. Louis. We only had one night in town so we were thrilled that this gastropub delivered, both in their cocktails and their food offerings. The mezcal cocktail was particularly good. Service was stellar and I highly recommend checking them out if you're in town.
__label__4	What a cute find. I had been looking for a chill place to have my morning Chi tea. Finally found it. Unfortunately server did not wear a mask.
__label__4	Top 3 places I've eat while in New Orleans!!! I've been here for a week. It was a honor to meet Mrs. Chase.
__label__4	Very good food , clean bright place . Service was good , would recommend , will visit again when in the area
__label__4	This is a nice little breakfast place. The food and good, the prices were reasonable and the staff was pleasant. They were short staffed when we were there so service was a bit slow but I cannot hold that against them.  I definitely plan on going again.
__label__4	Run DONT walk over to Ukuleles. Especially for their famous Reuben burger. Juicy and cooked to perfection. And don't get me started on the crab dip, it is absolutely to die for. To all of Ukuleles competitors: YOURE NOT THAT GUY PAL. I give it a dive bar review 4/5. A nice touch of a dart board and/or bigger TVs would up it to a perfect 5/5.
__label__4	Cute new place! Their frozen custard is so good! They post their daily flavors to their social media accounts. They also offer a variety of flavored ice. The price is average for what you get. The waffle cone was amazing. Looking forward to going back after they get some of the kinks out.
__label__4	Best phò in Nashville. Get some to go, heat broth, cook beef in the soup. It's the real deal. Eat with chopsticks.
__label__4	Yum, yum, yummy!!! My only reason for not giving perfect stars is that the price for this event has gone up every year. And some of the dishes are exactly the same or smaller. The set up is much better this year the corridors are wider and there is way more seating with lots of picnic tables. Well done event planners, I'm thorough impressed.
__label__4	i really love the freshness of these smoothies---they are nothing like smoothie king which is very sweet these actually seem healthy to me....For sure get the Madame Blueberry it isn't on the menu but seems to be the most popular smoothie as everytime i am in there getting one i hear somebody else order one also....
__label__4	Second time for me.  The food at Atchafalaya is simply delicious.  I am a pretty good cook, so a restaurant has to be really special or I'll stay home and cook it myself.  This was yummy food and I tasted everything at the table.  Only four stars because our waiter was a little distracted.  For example, he took my drink order and then left my two friends staring at me in wonder.
__label__4	New to the area, walking down the street with a ton of places to eat,  this place is mobbed with a wait list for Monday lunch, had to stop and try it. Always eat at the place the locals  easy,  right?  Good service,  good food and lots of it.  Lunch - chicken sandwich came with a side AND either a cup of soup or a salad. Local chain. I'll be back for dinner.
__label__4	Whether you're there for the buffet or ordering out, definitely get the lamb chops. They may call it something else, but they're divine.
__label__4	I love the feel of this place. So chill right in the middle of Bourbon street! This is a great place to come and just hang out. Grab a drink at the bar and listen to some good music. I've had cafe au lait and beignets here. Pretty good for Nola! I've also stopped through a few times while on Bourbon Street to grab a table in the patio area to listen to a song or two. I love the statues of the music greats at the entrance! Super cool charm and history here.
__label__4	"The staff was very friendly and the breakfast was great.  If you are looking for pancakes that taste like dessert, this is place! 
The biscuits and gravy were filling and delicious. 
This is a definite stop if you are in the area."
__label__4	I went here for the first time because of the groupon for a facial and massage. The massage was great. The facial was not the greatest I've ever had but I'd give it another try. I went back a second time for a deep tissue massage after I destroyed my back. Best massage ever. I will definitely get that again. As an added plus, they gave me a $20 coupon for my next visit both times.
__label__4	We went there twice for breakfast. A convenient location and not a horrible wait. Ate once inside and once outside. Had the southern breakfast, french toast, corned beef hash eggs benedict and eggs blackstone. All were good and the service good.
__label__4	"I've been here twice with my fiance--once to get fitted for a rental tuxedo, and another time to buy a suit for our wedding. Both times I was very impressed with the service. They were very knowledgeable and helpful but not pushy. Plus, the men who work there all look sharp in their suits which lends some confidence to the whole thing. Some salesmen at other stores looked like they got dressed in the dark. 

My fiance got his suit tailored here too, and he's happy with the tailoring."
__label__4	Chuck was a great bartender. The wings are amazing and I am a wing lover.  Some of the best I have had. Great location, excellent food and great place to watch a game.  I will be back.
__label__4	"This place is awesome.  For between $10-$17 you can get a fantastic pizza.  You just have to do the baking, which I prefer anyway because then it isn't cold by the time it gets to your house.

I love the chicken BBQ and the stuffed pizzas.

They also have salads and drinks, so you can get your whole meal.

They accept phone orders and will have it ready by the time you show up.  If you walk-in, sometimes you have to wait 5-10 minutes depending on how busy they are."
__label__4	Love this place for the fresh seafood. We go there all the time when we want fresh seafood.
__label__4	This place is unpretentious and the food is always good. The marinated chicken breast is outstanding. They it on the sandwich or on the cob salad. Its always tender and well seasoned. The salads are large!  The iced tea is properly brewed. The prices are pretty low, too. This is honesly one of my favorite spots in downtown Tampa.
__label__4	nice place- drinks were very good, although the waitress was a bit frazzled- having to cover the entire bar alone. Made for a long wait  for a drink ( not her fault at all) Quiet place unlike the madhouse bars in the rest of the Quarter
__label__4	margarita pitcher was delicious.  I had the beans, mixed in a little of the corn and ordered the chicken tacos and couldn't be more content right now. There were seven adults eating for a mid afternoon Sunday lunch, all content with a pitcher of margaritas and an pitcher of mojitos for $150 pre tip
__label__4	Always had great meals here. I do recommend it highly. The steak I had the other night had a very strong grill flavor. More so than ever before. Not sure why but seeing as I have eaten here 50 times and 49 were outstanding and this last one was still ok, I will keep going back. Pressure cooked fried chicken dinner is outstanding.
__label__4	Pretty good. Lots of new stuff to try. Only complaint is that the server wouldn't let me get my steak above medium rare. Said it ruins the quality of the meat or something. Not like I asked for it well done with ketchup, lol! he seemed a little uppity to me. oh well, good food. would have liked to enjoy without judgment.
__label__4	We tried this place for the first time for lunch. It was really good and the portions are large. We shared our entrees I had the gyro with roasted potatoes and my husband tried the calamari which came with rice, bread, green beans and potatoes.  The location is on a side street from 36 you may not see it from 36 but worth looking for. Next time we're definitely trying the flaming cheese appetizer.
__label__4	Pat's beat Geno's hands down! How is this even a competition?? Pat's is more flavorful, more moist, and I feel like it's got more meat to bread ratio.
__label__4	It's in the Treme section of Nolo. Reservations recommended especially if you have a large party. Amazing fried chicken! I didn't like the Mac and cheese, but the fried chicken ranks up there in my top 5, which is why I'm giving it such a high rating
__label__4	We were visiting Boise last weekend and we like to try local places so this fit the bill. I got a Classic with purple fries thin cut. The burger was pretty basic, no complaints. The purple fries were good and they give you a ton of them. I loved all the options of seasonings and dipping sauces, that was super cool. I sprinkled my fries with the garlic rosemary season and it was delish. I had some garlic aoli and blueberry ketchup with them. I think they were a teensy bit overpriced but overall I was happy we tried them.
__label__4	"I would give the food here 5 stars but the service wasn't all that great or personable. But the manager was very helpful and friendly I would like to add. 

My partner and I ordered the Fried Green Tomatoes and Fried Shrimp Poe boy and they were both delicious! We even came back just to get some fried green tomatoes and their artichoke dip to go before leaving the French Quarter. 

I would recommend coming to this place early evening because it gets extremely busy and it's not a very big restaurant so seating is very close together."
__label__4	Trevor reached out and solved my problems very quickly after posting. Will give another shot just due to awesome customer service in solving problems :)
__label__4	I had the pulled pork sandwich with Mac and cheese and cornbread. The meat was tender, and there were many barbecue options. I sampled a few; love a lot of sauce!!! The Mac and cheese was average, there was too much cheese compared to noodles. Overall, a good meal and would return.
__label__4	A great place to get a poolside and beach side burger. They have some of the best views of the beach and sunset! A very cool 50 style hotel.
__label__4	Dillon Cookie ! - oatmeal, pecans, chocolate chips need I say more
__label__4	"Went for a late lunch on Sunday 7/14. We were seated immediately as there were only a few others in the restaurant. The food is excellent! I had the chicken sausage and my hubby had the loaded chicken nachos. 

Service was very slow, I had to ask another waiter for another drink (yay for BOGO Free!!), and we had to ask another one for our check. Otherwise - would've given 5 stars.

We will definitely be back when we're in Nashville."
__label__4	Great variety, quality and service. The milk chocolate cake donuts are out of this world!
__label__4	Wawa is always good in a pinch. They have everything I'm craving. Only thing I don't enjoy about this particular Wawa is that it closes at 11 pm. On Saturday night after being out at the bar, this is most inconvenient.
__label__4	"The Varsity Club has been around forever...and is a good family sports bar.  Lots of TVs, some games for the kids, and good food.  

The menu is mostly ""bar food"", but there is a good variety.  The burgers are very good, and reasonably priced.  

This is a great place to watch a game (lots of TVs) or to come with a big group.  Don't expect anything too fancy -- just a good place to have a good time."
__label__4	love this place.    so much better than the place down the street.  we did an array of appetizers, and oysters.      lots of fun.  big ol glass of wine as well.  enjoyed watching the sunset as we had our nosh, and service was quick and fast.   I will be coming to this place more often.
__label__4	Called with an electrical issue. They were very responsive and sent out an electrician that day. Called an hour before the electrician would come as a heads up. Kevin was personable, took the time to explain the issue, and even helped me with an extra project that I had. The initial troubleshooting cost was a bit high, but the other charges were competitive. I will definitely call them again!
__label__4	"Solid spot. Lots of outlets, friendly fellow working the bar, and a full assortment of coffee brewing methods: aero, chemex, pourover, etc., plus a lovely espresso machine. The smoothie I tasted was a little on the sweet side, and my Chinese Breakfast tea was oversteeped, but that's what you get for ordering tea at a boutique coffee bar. The wifi is free but wasn't very fast when I was in there.

Conveniently located next to Lids in case you need to buy a hat while waiting for your coffee."
__label__4	The tempura green beans were so good! I would honestly go back again for those alone. Perfect crunch and green beans tasted fresh. The cheeseburger was pretty average, but got the job done. I would probably order a different burger or sandwich next time to mix it up..of course with the tempura green beans.
__label__4	Visited during the Mardi Gras Weekend. The service was great, food came out very quickly. The prices however I don't feel represented the quality of food being offered. I had a Carfish Po Boy, after the meal I felt a bit gutted for what I was charged.
__label__4	Recently stayed there. Rooms are very comfortable and clean. Beds are very comfortable. Breakfast downstairs  includes, eggs,sausage,bacon,hash,bagels,Danish, cereals,yogurts,apples and oranges.,and ma ke your ow n waffles.  This hotel is not within walking distance to anything though so just be aware of that. There us no pool.Overall a very nice stay
__label__4	Oh, my - that was good!  I met a friend here for lunch and I ordered the Marinated Veggie Sandwich and she ordered the Turkey Avocado sandwich and we split and shared.  The sandwiches are HUGE and totally delicious!  The bread is amazing.  And the side of pasta salad is also fantastic - it comes with a balsamic dressing.  I will definitely be back because there's so many things on the menu that I want to try!  The service was also very good.  I highly recommend.
__label__4	Tried it today for the first time very good. The jerk chicken was fantastic!  Also tried the beef patty and fried wing and would recommend them both. I cant wait to go back!
__label__4	I enjoy coming here to grab a drink, quick snack, or share it with those who are visiting! The service has always been great and they have many delicious beer options. On Tuesdays they have trivia which can get a little noisy if you're sitting in the dining area, but that is to be expected. When it isn't super busy you can find parking on the side of the building.
__label__4	We visited during COVID and were sat at their makeshift outdoor patio. Jessica was our server and she was great.  There was a nice variety of food and their pizza was good. There Honey Darlin' drink was amazing and I would get it again. It did begin to rain, so we had to leave because there was not much to protect us from the rain but our waitress packaged out meals and we took them to go. I would definietly go back
__label__4	"Ordered online and picked up at their pick up window. 
Harvest Grain Apple Salad - perfect combo of sweet, salty and tangy. Satisfying vegetarian option if you don't add a grill item. 
Parm Piada stick - guess I'll never know. Wasn't in the bag. Tho the dipping sauce was? 
Cannoli chips and dip - so good! Decent sized serving. 
Would have given a 5 if the parm stick was in the bag."
__label__4	Food was great. A little on the pricey side. Interesting floor seating. A little on the loud side. Great spot if you're craving thai.
__label__4	Don't judge a book by its cover! The prices were fair the food was fresh and fast and it's a byob!!
__label__4	"Attended a job fair at UMSL. The Spring 2011 Career Fair, I was there representing my employer.

I often find myself dreading job fairs, b/c more often than not the candidates will be unprepared and not really ready to discuss business opportunities.

However, at UMSL I was really surprised. All of the students I spoke with were dressed in professional attire and most were ready to discuss the company and some had even went as far as researching our company and telling me why they want to work for us.

I would give them a 5 stars, but this is strictly based on my career fair experience."
__label__4	Mom and I enjoyed the shrimp & grits & the mussel appetizer.  Dessert was an incredible Chocolate option that felt like a Chocolate cream cheese.  Prices were OK.  Service was good, and the ambiance was fine for family or a first date.  I would like to return with my tequila lover.
__label__4	My brother and I come here every weekend we get together. He just loves their hoagies. I usually opt for the cheesesteak. The staff is alway great. We love this place.
__label__4	"This was stop 2 in my wine tasting night. We had an Argentine wine here. Very Nice!
San Huberto Malbec, Argentina 
We had White Mussels, Grilled Octopus & Shrimp Fideos, we had a few other appetizers that were all tasty. This is one of many trendy, urban watering holes in the city of Philadelphia. This is a must stop place for some good food and some great drinks.

Enjoy!!"
__label__4	Popped in here for some raw oysters and caviar and a beer. The oysters were prepped just right. Couldn't give it 5 stars because although the oysters were really good they weren't 5 star. Great place and service.
__label__4	Best price for a Brazilian in the city. Gloria was great and put me at ease. However my appointment was at 10 AM, and the receptionist didn't show up until about 5 after to unlock the doors. I was still out by 1030 AM.
__label__4	Cheesesteak night is the best. Get there early though place fills up fast.!! Parking is located across the street in an old mill parking lot. Customer service is satisfactory but nothing exceptional. Overall I like the atmosphere and would recommend. Only improvement they could do is change around the menu for season's every once in a while.
__label__4	I bought extra meatballs to feed to my dog... he was doing backflips they tasted so good! Pizza is always great. 10/10 would recommend.
__label__4	"My sons just ordered from Evo tonight and normally we are pleased with their food. HOWEVER, tonight we ordered a cheesesteak and it will definitely be our last time. What they gave us is a baby cheesesteak. Needless to  say my teenagers are overwhelmingly disappointed.


UPDATE: I called and they credited my kiddo's account. That was awesome of them to credit my kid's account, and I instantly have happy teenagers  I'll let you know how the next one turns out."
__label__4	"Philadelphia's own Kati Roll gem. One of those rare restaurants that's open late, easy on the pocket l(5.50 per roll) and is sure to tantalize your tastebuds - a combination that's hard to beat! And it's a lighter alternative to late night pizza. 

There are over a dozen different options including variations of chicken, beef and Paneer(cottage cheese). If you are looking for food after a drunk night with your friends, or if you are just scouring the city for good, cheap late night eats, this should be on your list!"
__label__4	After a long hike along the Carpenteria Bluffs and beyond, we were too pooped to go out, so we ordered in from Rusty's. The pizza was delivered sooner than they had estimated and was just what we wanted. We ordered and got a meat pizza on thin crust. I can't remember what it was called but it had chirizo on it. Yum. The price was fair for what we got. I don't think you can go wrong.
__label__4	The food is ok is not amazing but is not bad at all, the music was too loud and they should mix the kind of live music, like Latin music 5 min sometime?
__label__4	"Great spot for after dinner drinks and we were fortunate to find a spot on the balcony because there is no inside drinking allowed these days due to COVID. Second floor, overlooking the insanity of Bourbon Street.

Two-for-one specials meant that I now have two cold beers to drink. I'm not sad.

[Review 14209 overall, 1531 of 2020, number 29 in Louisiana.]"
__label__4	This place is fantastic! I've gone here several times and each time the staff is fantastic. Bottomless mimosa brunch here is great. We always like the food. The staff is great and it really is bottomless. I will keep going here cause it's great.
__label__4	Enjoy this place very much! Love to come here and dance on a girls night out and the bartenders make the mixed drinks pretty well.
__label__4	"* Casual and cute decor
* Outdoor seating
* Good for groups
* Excellent tater tots- wish they served a sweet potato version
* Loved the Barnyard (Pulled Pork BBQ, BBQ sauce and creamy slaw)- great combination of flavors. Could use a stronger bun because it got soft so quickly from soaking up all the juices."
__label__4	A hidden surprise....creative drink menu.  Nice ambiance.  Pretty ecclectic people who come through.  I've been quite a few times here and there.  The bartenders are always pretty friendly (always pretty busy also).  Nice spot for a quick drink.
__label__4	This is my first year living at the republic and I really like it. The community is very nice and I would recommended it to my friends. The rooms and the apartment are nice and the appliances are up to date.
__label__4	Gumbo Shop has good gumbo, and we loved the alligator sausages; however, the jambalaya was wholly disappointing as was the service and the wait. I feel like the servers were doing their very best but it sounded like they hadn't received Relief or a break in  a very long time making them come off exasperated and forgetful.
__label__4	Nice atmosphere- a little loud noise level at dinner but good service and good food/ array on menu. Extensive beer list and cocktails and they have an outside deck for nice afternoons.
__label__4	I love the atmosphere here. A bonus, you can hear the music from Judy's Velvet Lounge without going all the way in.
__label__4	Surprised by the really great service and hot food at 2pm on a Friday. Cobb salad could have been better but other than that loved the spinach dip and chicken sandwich.
__label__4	Food is good. I eat here Every so often on lunch. It is kind of pricy, especially if you're just getting a burrito and drink ~11 bucks.
__label__4	Love the discounts at this outlet but the one in Delaware always comes out being cheaper especially with no sales tax! If you love coach, you'll love it here.
__label__4	"It's been a while but I saw this one come up in the activity feed and it brought back memories of a more diverse culinary universe than where we currently live.

We lived a few minutes from here and did dinner more than once. The main items we order are butter chicken, masala and tandoor chicken.

Always liked the beer selection here too and had naan with our dinner.

Atmosphere was as you would expect for an Indian themed eatery and service was always steady and friendly.

Would not hesitate to return when in town again. Wish we had something like this in our ville."
__label__4	I had never heard of Hungry Howie's but you know what? It was kinda goood. The subs are basically mini pizza dough wraps. It all is freshly made (or cooked, I'm sure the food is already constructed) and yeah it's a huge chain and I don't like giving money to chains, but I do like the systems and doing something new. So yeah, 4 stars.
__label__4	Love Panera. .....except the bbq chicken salad dressing was changed and it tastes awful. Bring back the other dressing!
__label__4	We are fans of Target and this locations is not different.  This locations is large and roomy.  There is plenty of room to move around.  I will note that at times when the University is starting up it does get a little crowded with students and parents doing some last minute school supply shopping.  Other then that it is a relatively quiet store.  This is a Super Target so you get a nice selection of groceries.
__label__4	Fantastic poutine. They could use a better patty for their burgers but the other ingredients were very fresh. Good price.
__label__4	BEST ZA in tucson! but they need to invest in an air-conditioner.  its almost a deal breaker for me.
__label__4	The store outside and inside didn't look well but the taste of their food is good and i cant complain
__label__4	"Went for their ice cream. It was okay. Would come back because they have good deals on their meals. 
Service was also friendly. They have that that diner feel to them so it's comforting"
__label__4	"This place has an amazing happy hour especially if you like cheap oysters! I've tried shucking them myself - it's best to leave it to experts. Tried both the chargrilled and raw. Raw oysters are super fresh! Chargrilled are perfectly toasted with right amount of cheese so they're not too greasy!

The only issue that I've ever had is that it's impossible to sit outside. Multiple times I've tried with no luck. Each time it's just restaurant doesn't have enough staff to maintain outdoor seating."
__label__4	"Yum - just yum. That's really all you need to know. Cheesesteak sandwiches however you want them. No gristle, no big chewy pieces, perfectly chopped and tender. 

Not a big place or a fancy place and make sure to bring cash. It was a clean place and the sandwich was way more than I or my friend could eat in one sitting (that's not saying much for me, but saying a lot for him!). If you leave this place hungry it's your own fault. 

I'll be back again soon!"
__label__4	This restaurant was new my hotel and decided to check it out. The street is very quite on weekdays and the place is very empty. There was only 1 customer when i walk in. I ordered the Spinach pizza and soda. They have lots of TV with sport channel for viewing while waiting for your food. The personal pizza is perfect for me and the dough is very soft. Value for money :-)
__label__4	The shrimp in the shrimp and grits was super yummy.  The grits were nothing special, but I'm from the north. Greg had the shrimp po boy and it too was yummy.  Friendly, efficient service along the water.
__label__4	Very friendly service.  I got take away.  Fried egg rolls were crispy and light.  Dipping sauce was a little thin.  Soup was flavorful and had plenty of noodles and associated proteins (seafood and chicken).
__label__4	"Great little coffee shop. I had the croissant French toast, which comes with maple syrup and a little fruit bowl. The croissant French toast was fantastic. It had some kind of delicious banana filling, I highly recommend it. The fruit was okay, but I cared more about the croissant French toast, which was (again) so good.

Also the iced coffee was flavorful, but mild enough that I didn't need to sweeten it, which I usually do. Solid 4 stars."
__label__4	Not the most extensive menu selection, but the food was still AMAZING nonetheless!! Very good price point for what you are buying, and the lack of pretty presentation of the food is made up for with the amazing taste. Definitely not a place you would look at and run into, but if you manage to come across it GO! the inside is beautiful, they have old vhs movies lined up and discs along with records, and they even had a movie (The Craft) playing for us when we arrived!! great environment, great customer service, great tasting-food!
__label__4	Stopped in Sunday afternoon for a to-go order to watch Blues Hockey at home. Bartender was friendly and I ordered the BBQ Flatbread. Chicken, Bacon bits, BBQ sauce, and french fries on top. Smelled delicious tasted of the cardboard box used as the to-go box. Puzzles me why places wont lay a piece of waxed paper,parchment, butcher paper...whatever to halt the taste of cardboard box. Come on you can do better.
__label__4	I'm one of those weird people... I only eat roast beef po'boys here lol !! They are so good, so messy, just right ! I've tried their gumbo once it was ok. I highly recommend getting a roastbeef po'boy here, it will blow your mind.
__label__4	We had a good time here! Came to Nashville, specifically Broadway, in search of great, live country music, which seemed hard to find on a Thursday night (shockingly!) but this place came through. They had great live bands on both levels and we really enjoyed it. Liked how they had a nice patio and a pretty big bar. Spent some time on the main level people watching over Broadway, they have nice windows for that if you enjoy a good crowd, ha! Overall a great experience!
__label__4	We were New Orleans for vacation and were looking for somewhere good to eat. Burgers sounded good so we went to The Yard. The burgers were delicious per the rest of the group and I had the Zues Chicken sandwich which was devious. The sweet potato fries were fabulous! We also tried the Muffalattaa Eggs were awesome! It was definitely two thumbs up!
__label__4	Love this place! They have good drinks but sometimes it can get packed and a little bit of a wait!
__label__4	One of our favorite breakfast spots.  Good pancakes, good coffee and service.  Owners aim to please!
__label__4	I am will (and can't wait) to stay here again!  Very friend staff with great recommendations that make you feel like a native!
__label__4	"The Lingnan is very busy tonight with lots of Oilers jerseys at the tables. We're going to the game too and this restaurant is very close to the arena.

My husband and I had the buffet for a fast in and out, but the food is so good we had seconds. I loved the Mandarin shrimp, crunchy fresh shrimp in a light sauce with vegetables while my husband especially enjoyed the traditional ginger beef with slices of fresh ginger.

Even though we ordered the buffet we were served won ton soup before our meal and crunchy donuts at the end.

The service was impeccable."
__label__4	"Solid Fast-Food Mexican. I have cravings for their chorizo. 
I have never left this restaurant disappointed. And that's saying something."
__label__4	I never hopped on the frozen yogurt trend train, but I do like Swee CeCe's quite a lot.  They have a variety of interesting flavors beyond basic tart and vanilla, with an array of toppings like fruit, nuts, granola and all different kinds of candy.  You serve yourself, so you can control how much or how little you want!
__label__4	We come here for drinks all the time after my wife and I get off work. Warren is an awesome guy and great bartender, and has a great staff now!  Come here for some spicy margaritas, they're on point!
__label__4	"Brought the family in about 530pm for dinner. Everyone enjoyed their meals.
My son and I got the all you can eat ribs. They kept the refills coming.
Waitress was very good. Food was hot and fresh.
My old complaint is that they do not offer fresh green sides. A BBQ place should have home made collard greens and green beans. Nothing from a can.
Oh, salad bar was very good also."
__label__4	Love their food here. It is so hard to find a good quality meal here in Nashville that is decently priced. Most of the nice restaurants in Nashville are way overpriced in my opinion. City House is a great little find!! Their pizza is huge and their pasta (i believe) is handmade. Great little date place or casual girls night out dinner :)
__label__4	"had a really nice meal here.

reasonably priced, simply - but well prepared food.

very friendly service in a pleasant atmosphere."
__label__4	Spinach bacon pizza to-go please!  So delicious. If you are ordering take-out, its best to get their as early as you are able as they do not keep your food in a warmer, but on the front shelf near the register. At least that was my experience.
__label__4	This place is fairly new, and may be off to a slow start till word of mouth gets out! We enjoy the lunch menu, the beer is priced right, potions good. They have special event days. Yummy tenderloins! Give it a try! You'll love it too!
__label__4	"Ate here last week. There is no menu, just 3 different T-bones ranging in size from huge to gi-friggin-gantic and a Filet. Sides are potatoes au gratin, gi-friggin-gantic steak fries, and onion rings.The quality was good, but not quite ""high end."" The prices were almost high end though. I enjoyed everything (well, everything I was able to eat, although there were leftovers). And would go back, but not all the time, as the prices were... not low."
__label__4	I love hot chicken and Big Shakes does not disappoint. Huge portions that you can mix and match for a tasty meal. The hot fish was a surprise as was the milkshakes and deep fried oreos. A treat for the whole family
__label__4	"Have only dined in once, but was pleased with the service and food. Our server was great, especially with our kids - but it felt a little too ""fancy"" and quiet for our 2 & 4 year old... so take out it is :)"
__label__4	This was an awesome meal. My steak was cook to perfection! I ate all of my husbands green beans were AMAZING!!! I do wish there were more side options but I can't complain about anything that we ordered. The seating is very limited so be sure to make a reservation. We didn't and had to sit at the bar. That was ok but a table would have been more comfortable. Overall a great restaurant.
__label__4	"Great place to check out live bands! Open mic Thursdays are nice to check out new talent. 

Nine (9) TV screens for viewing multiple games or televised events. 

Friendly staff that are always attentive. 

2 FREE pools tables to play on"
__label__4	"Working Lunch = delicious decision.

We used Uber Eats it was there in no time. 
It was excellent! The only bummer I thought it came with rice and beans.

The taquitos were excellent! 
The tacos looked LEGIT! 

Definitely check it out if you have a hankering for Mexican!"
__label__4	Good place to grab a bite to eat. It's hit or miss on the wait depending on time of day and if there is a local event. Be sure to know the secret menu to unlock and level up your meal. The food here is always fresh and tastes good. If it isn't up to your satisfaction they will remake it for you. There are some vegetarian options like grilled cheese and animal fries. Also the fries are vegan, so your powers are safe!
__label__4	The desserts are so good I can't tell a lie afterwards! The bacon maple cupcake and salted Carmel whoopie pie are amazing. If you ever want to make a great impression just show up with her pastries in hand. Forget flowers and wine... This is the best choice for life time bliss!
__label__4	Friendly and helpful staff. Opened the door for us. Loaded the machine. We needed to wash a down quilt. Very reasonable prices and quick service. Depending on our dry cleaning needs we will definitely go again.
__label__4	Thumbs up,,, well stocked store, dig around for awhile you will find something to use and more.....
__label__4	"I went here with a couple friends on a Friday night. I ordered margaritas and sat in their lounge area where they had cute porch swings to sit on. I had a nice time observing the decor (especially the hundreds of wrestling masks on the walls!) and the restaurant had a 70s Mexican wrestling movie playing which was interesting. 

The only thing I would improve is the lounge/bar area is pretty small since 95% of the tables in the restaurant were for dinner reservations only, so we had to wait a couple minutes for a table in the lounge to free up. But very cute and entertaining place!"
__label__4	Great atmosphere for a quiet meal with excellent food and service.  Always some jazz playing in the background and Wildcats on TV in the bar! Never been disappointed with the food and have always  had spectacular service!
__label__4	First time here. Didnt take long for the food to come out, we ordered the spanish omelet and it was awesome! Wanted to get a second one! The server was kinda rushing us to order. But the food shined through. We would come back again
__label__4	Service was exceptional.  Hostess is rude and not very friendly, but that's a minor detail.  Food was great, our server was amazing.  Their Sunday Gravy dish is delicious!
__label__4	I love this little bar.  I was staying at the Double Tree just a block away and found myself coming here a couple times during my stay.  The staff and customers are very friendly.  Their food is also very good.  Be sure to try their chicken wings.  Get there early or you won't find a seat.
__label__4	"i havent ate alot of cheese steaks, but i have to say, tony makes a mean cheese steak.  yes whiz with all the way.  and if youre wondering how it compares to ginos and pats, iduno, i never been there, but all i have to say is bobby flay, even though im not too found of him, challenged him to a throw down.  i think at one point, tony lukes was voted best of philly in the philadelphia magazine.  o yea, the cajun fries are not bad also

4.0 stars"
__label__4	"Mm mmm tamales! 24 hour notice required if getting more than 6! So far these are the best tamales and closest to East L.A. flavor that I'm used to eating. 

Rest of the food is ok but I'm a native Angeleno so my standards are high. Love those tamales!"
__label__4	Didn't expect it but, Mirro's Pizzeria was simply impressive. From the staff to the atmosphere to the prices, no complaints about Mirro's Pizzeria. The food here is magnificent, I had quite a few items off their menu, but White Pie is especially great in my opinion. The staff was attentive, quick, and really friendly. Just what we needed.
__label__4	I love that they have gluten free options and make their sauces fresh so that gf soy dice can be used. The shrimp in garlic sauce was probably one of the best I've ever had!
__label__4	Wow amazed at what a huge indian grocery store this is! There's a variety of things you can get from your vegetables, meats, produce and deli.  I think they are in process of adding other businesses inside the building.  Its literally huge inside.  It's tucked behind the main road.  Good variety for sure!
__label__4	"If you want a good, straight up cup of coffee, this is your spot. 

As a side note, Anton is one of the friendliest barista/managers I've had the pleasure of being served by."
__label__4	Extremely helpful. Anxious about running again and finding the right shoes for New Orleans. Owner was extremely personable and professional, felt like my coach was helping me pick out the best shoes for me!
__label__4	Good sized Philly Subs, just like being up North. Even with Tasty Cakes.
__label__4	Not a fan of Thai food, but I have been there three times, I feel it is better and better. Maybe I chose the right dishes.
__label__4	"Great place to relax to cups of coffee or tea and sandwiches and catch up on studying..sandwiches are okay but  not that great..
If you live in University City during summer..you can enjoy outside seating and free WiFi."
__label__4	You need to stop here for the history alone. This tiny place claims to be the oldest bar in the United States. It's been slinging drinks since 1772. We were there during the day. We found a table and enjoyed a drink. The service was friendly and prompt. The fireplace and bar seem to be the originals. There are photos of celebrity visits on the wall. Cheers!
__label__4	Great unique foods you can't find anywhere else. It's the perfect place to bring people who are visiting the area and want to go somewhere fun. Devin was a great server, very friendly and efficient! He even brought my mom a cupcake for her birthday. The only downside is the drinks are extremely over priced for the small amount you receive so I wouldn't come here for drinks. Other than that I wouldn't highly recommend!
__label__4	I love Domenica. The pizza with a fried egg on it sounds weird but is soo good. The small and large plate options make it easy to get a few things to share or just one thing to have for yourself. The house-made pastas are phenomenal and the wine list is stellar.  Good location and being able to valet with the hotel is convenient. The bread they serve is really good and the dessert menu made it hard to chose just one.
__label__4	This is my favorite Mexican place in middle TN prices are fair and the food is great. In the past the service has been bad, not rude just slow. However as of late they have really improved.
__label__4	The food was excellent! We appreciate the holistic approach of your community and the higher consciousness we all need to reach. Congratulations! Our concern with our visit to your Cafe is customer relations; we were not greeted when we entered nor did anyone say goodbye. The waitstaff have to be trained. To experience good service, go around the corner to the Goodwill Store; they have it down. Others on Yelp have also critiqued your service. Your excellent food and forward thinking beliefs are not enough to carry you. Customers must be attended to. Good luck. We will return. Thank you.
__label__4	Best breakfast and it won't break the bank either! Sausage is yummy french toast is cinnamon gooey and home fries hit the spot! Just a good place for a late breakfast! But only accept cash! And really small!
__label__4	Went there this past Sunday. Very crowded. Waited over an hour for a lane. Made a firearms purchase. The man who wrote me up was not super helpful, but I did buy a Glock. They kind of speak for themselves. The price was NOT negotiable. I did do some comparable pricing when I got home and I was charged a fair price.
__label__4	I originally thought this was a byo and brought wine. It's not. They kindly opened the wine anyway! I've been there multiple times. One unfortunate time te food took a really really long time to come out. I was gnawing my arm off. Portions are kind of small when you're that hungry.  I really enjoy the grilled calamari. If it comes out at a normal speed.
__label__4	been here a couple of times, the theme is great, everything is clean and fun. they've got many things to choose from, even my picky brother was able to find something he enjoyed. the food was great, but the service was a little spotty. i understand things get busy and stressful but i was interrupted when i spoke, and i got a snarky remark when i tried to pay half in cash half with card. other than that i will be back!
__label__4	I am new to the South so bbq to me has mostly been limited to bugers and hot dogs. Needless to say I'm far from expert on the topic but I really did enjoy whitts pulled pork sandwich.  The meat had good flavor and wasnt dry; didnt even need any sauce
__label__4	The location I like is the truck at 30th & market sts the fish is fried just right not too hard :-) the rice n beans are spicy and the greens and cabbage are soooo good the juice just drips from my lips lol
__label__4	This store is a great alternative when shopping for gifts.  I get so tired of mall stores...just more of the same.  Here, who knows what you'll come up with!?
__label__4	"It's freezing in here!!!!! Omggggg! I can't take it! Brrrrr!
The sushi and poke bowl is delicious. 
The food took a lonnnnnng time though.. they brought my salad out first, then the sushi.. twenty five minutes later, then my friends poke bowl 20 minutes later! I'm freezing!!! Pack my sushi to go!!! I can't even enjoy it in here with these goosebumps omgggggg!!!! Please!"
__label__4	The food was sooo good!  And free dessert!! The host was very sweet and bathrooms were clean and have a cute theme.  Our sever could have been better and butter for starter bread could be softer  but over all am very happy with visit. Will deff be back!
__label__4	"This DSW is due for a renov,  it looks more like a plain warehouse than the others that have couches, chandeliers, TV. YET, I would still return. 

Staff is super nice, went out of their way to call around for a shoe for me.
Used my $10 gift certificate I earned from their club, (a free, must join).

Like how I can walk quickly down the aisles and scan for shoes, saving time.
Like the discounts on designers too.

They also carry accessories like purses, shoe inserts, etc."
__label__4	Marra's is pretty good. It oozes Italian tradition from the decor to the overall atmosphere and feel of the place. You can bring your dog if you sit outside. The Chicken Supremo personal pizza is a personal favorite, the pasta dishes look great too!
__label__4	I really enjoyed the time we spent here. The space is nice and open and very well decorated. They do smoke hookah's in here but the smoke is not overwhelming. I met friends here for dinner and drinks and was pleased with the selection and taste of food. The service was decent and I think it would have been top notch if there was not just one server for the whole place. This is definatly a great place to have dinner or just hang out for a while. Looking forward to going back.
__label__4	I was here for the first time about a month ago and was pretty impressed! I got the strawberry mojito which was very tasty and refreshing. We got the Saganaki for an appetizer which was recommended by the bartender and it was an excellent choice. Melted cheese with an apricots compote on top served with fresh pita. Very delicious! The bartender was extremely friendly, helpful, and very accommodating as well! I will be back here again in the future!
__label__4	"I went to Underdogs the day it opened and many times since!

I'm a huge fan of the special dogs they serve, specifically the Mac Daddy- fried Mac and cheese and broccoli with jalapeño sour cream. Delish

I don't *love* the bread, it's just a bit too doughy for me. They give free refills if you ask and the sriracha mayo is fantastic. I think the combo (dog, drink and fries) is a good deal for about 8 bucks."
__label__4	One of my favorite sandwich shops in South Tampa!  The sandwiches are huge so come with an appetite or a friend to share with.  Love the Golden Gate Sandwich and the Cuban Sandwich.  Good, quality lunch meat and the menu offers everything from creative and adventuresome sandwiches to classic favorites.  My favorite side dish: dill potato salad.  Favorite dessert: a toss between the cream cheese brownies or the lemon squares (yummy!).
__label__4	Super clean!! My favorite here is the BBQ dinner plate - juicy, perfect portion, I mean it has my name all over It. Also tried the Stromboli. Best to call ahead to avoid the wait of fresh food coming from the grill.
__label__4	Excited to have a taste of dim sum in the Metairie area! We ordered the soup dumplings which were terrific. I don't have much to go off of because it was my first time having dim sum but the flavors were delicious and my sister said it was spot on. The steamed shrimp dumplings were my favorite. I could have eaten twenty. Tons of fresh pastries to try. We split green tea crepe and it was very sweet and fresh. The reason this is 4 and not 5 is because of the cleanliness of the restaurant.
__label__4	I 100 percentage recommend this *hole* in the wall. Get it.... HOLE!? Cuz it's not.....it's fancy pantsy. They have empenadas! Caprese! That starts at 1130am which is why I didn't give 5 stars. I'd like that all day. They make a good breakfast.
__label__4	The wine and beer selection are not large, but are very well selected. The food is delicious, but for what you get maybe a bit over priced. The space is well light and comfortable although some of the seating tends to be too close together. Overall, a nice place for a date night or a quick stop in for a small plate meal and a glass of wine.
__label__4	Can't beat this place for the price. Lunch is a great deal!
__label__4	Beautiful interior- good beer and solid food. What more do u need in a brewery/ brewpub???
__label__4	i have been staying here for many times, love this place, very clean, simple, if u like IKEA furniture design style .this is the place for u w/o paying too much and u can stay for 1 nite, no problem. i wish breakfast could serve earlier aka 7AM. maybe
__label__4	I spent 3 mos traveling through Thailand and this spot is pretty authentic. Always great meals here and wonder why it's not packed with people. Make sure to get the Papaya Salad, chicken Larb and Kao Soi dish (pretty good with beef).
__label__4	"We stumbled on this place while out for a walk.  The experience here is very simple.  You walk in, serve yourself, and pay by the ounce.  The yogurt is slightly tart.  I enjoyed it.

If you live in the area, this is a nice place to walk to for a snack.  The park across the street is a nice place to hang out while you are eating your yogurt.  I'd recommend it for families, or anyone who walks in the area."
__label__4	"Pros: Nice room, food was generally quite good
Cons: Service was meh (two servers were unable to explain what was on the plate), and the food overall was a bit ""one-note"". 

I had the tasting menu which was generally quite delicious, though the penultimate course - lamb - was quite overcooked. 

If you are used to eating in fine dining establishments I think you'll find this *pretty good* - if you aren't used to it then you are quite likely to be impressed."
__label__4	Stopped in at the last minutes and loved it. Even for a busy night serve was on point and oysters were amazing!
__label__4	Yum! Stopped in on a whim with free time and was greeted and served promptly by friendly staff. She even walked me through all the flavors of cronuts. I got the cinnamon sugar cronut and a banana-caramel-cream filled donut with chocolate and walnuts on top. Both were yummy, but the cinnamon sugar cronut was my favorite. Next time I will get some bagels!
__label__4	Not our 1st time here, as always good food good service and fun atmosphere.
__label__4	Good food! They have some authentic Mexican dish that worth to try. The food is delicious!!! The only complain would be don't go there when it's busy .... They have a lot of people working but for some reason if we go in for dinner they always take forever to even get your water . So if you in a hurry don't go there.
__label__4	I was recently referred to Newsome Eye to repair my glasses, an Airloc brand that not many other opticians carried, so either could not or would not repair. Sam contacted the manufacturer for the needed part, but was informed that style was discontinued. He then made several more phone calls to locate frames that would work with the lenses, and was able to save me the expense of an entire new pair of glasses. Thanks to Sam for his help!
__label__4	Small place with rustic fresh pizza and other dishes as well as a full bar and some nice beers on tap. Great place to stop in, get a bite and enjoy a few cold ones. Dine inside or outside. The staff is easy going and friendly. My wife and I stumbled in here on a whim and really enjoyed it. Definitely worth giving them a try. I can imagine that this place gets pretty crowded at peak times.
__label__4	I liked this lounge. There was a fun, relaxing vibe. The drinks were good, the DJ was cool and the decor was unique. I'll be going back in the summer.
__label__4	Great foodie experience. Wait staff was VERY nice accommodating. Ahi app is fabulous. Great daily specials~if you're a meat lover or a veggie you'll be happy here. Menu is brief but sometimes that's a respite from decisions decisions decisions.
__label__4	This place has gotten SOO much better after they've remodeled the place.  Now they have a room with a pool table, nice bar with plenty of indoor seating considering the size of the place.  The great thing is that this bar is right on the river, and it's nice to sit outside and just enjoy the outside along the river with an alcoholic beverage.
__label__4	The pineapple fried rice is where it's at! The curries are very good too. Cute place, great service.
__label__4	"Santa Barbara staple now serving in Goleta. I love how they don't do Taco Tuesday because they don't need that. Lilly's is the best taco shop in town.

Try the steamed selection those are the best on the menu. Tripas is a weekend only option so do that if you love tripe. Go for crispy tripas, that is my recommendation.

$1.80 a taco, you will probably want 3 or 4 to satisfy your hunger and taco cravings."
__label__4	"UPDATE: Okay I came back again and the farmhouse burger is their best thing. I got the pastrami rueban, the meat was dry. It came with coleslaw but still felt dry. I had to give this 4 stars instead of 5.


They have ""flight club"" on Tuesdays, 5 sample mini drafts and food for 10 bucks- good deal! I think's between 5-7pm- check though."
__label__4	This is a really nice and spacious bar with delicious cocktails -the wide selection of mojitos is impressive! All is well except for the bartender's attitude the last time I was there... We'll see if he's gonna last?!
__label__4	This spot is amazing, must visit if around Conshy! We had avo toast and Nashville hot chicken. Megan was very friendly and attentive!! Thank you for such a wonderful experience
__label__4	"One star: Happy Hour-good
Two stars: Bartenders- very nice
Three stars:Location- Right on the riverfront after or before eating you take a walk nest to the water
Four stars:Food is good. Pricey but good."
__label__4	Crazy busy but we got seated pretty quick. Very interesting choices on the menu. We started with some onion rings. Frizzled vidalia, old Bay, malt vinegar. Pretty tasty. My main was the Nashville hot chicken sandwich.  Pretty tasty sandwich but could have used a little more heat for me.  Over all it was a pretty good lunch.  We want to go back and try out the bar. This place has to be a fun late night place to people watch.
__label__4	"Cash-only, and limited seating knock off a star (especially the limited seating!) but the food, here, is outstanding. I have not had anything I did not absolutely love, and the service is good. My servers have been happy to give me pointers on what to order. 

I eat here on a regular basis, and I take all of my friends."
__label__4	Decent selection of Burgundy wines. Not as quaint or personable service as some smaller wine shops, but staff is nice and helpful.
__label__4	"Really good food, clean and good service.
I ordered the Buffalo Grouper sandwich and it was really good, I'm looking forward to go back and get same thing again.
Only thing I wasn't very happy was the Bloody Mary, it was very liquid, the mix they used wasn't to good, nothing wrong with a strong drink but honestly did taste more vodka than anything else.
Overall good experience ."
__label__4	Came in with two friends on a Wednesday night for drinks.  I had the sweet potato fries which were only $3 while my friends shared the wings were on special that night.  Long list of beers that were available.  Customer service was great, not too crowded but not too empty.  Definitely enjoyed myself there and would come back for sure!
__label__4	This is a great place to stop in to if you're around or even make an hour drive (like my party did). Wait staff was really nice, and even though we had a large group they were able to accommodate us and fit us in fairly quickly. Portions are huge, and main menu items are great, but I feel as if they could've had a couple more solid appetizers and sides. Add some complementary dinner rolls and they'd be on it.
__label__4	This review is submitted a little later than intended... this is a great music venue to hear live jazz! This place is legit and will transport you to a different time and place. The musicians come from around the world to play here. It's not uncommon to meet new people; actually, we made friends with Swiss and Germans that were friends with the band.
__label__4	This is an amazing place to hangout anytime in the day... But evenings are the best... The seating outside right next to the fireplace is a great place... There is a variety of options for both veg and non vegetarians... The beers are good.. The mushroom flatbread is a must try... There usually will be some crowd and one might have to wait for sometime... But that makes the ambience even better... Would definitely visit again!!!
__label__4	This place has a great Stromboli and spaghetti with meatballs. Food was ready exactly when stated.  Great service and friendly staff.
__label__4	Great massage but the the sheets smelled musty and the bathroom was very dirty. Was able to make a walk-in appointment. Part of getting a massage is the ambience and it just didn't  stand up to 5 star standards.
__label__4	"what can I say... went for a quick trip and it had been a while since the last visit and was dying to get some good Cajun food... was note disappointed... seafood was excellent and the grilled oysters were as good as any other place out there...

service was good... friendly and informative... can't wait to go back..."
__label__4	When you come to Quick Custom Metals you get the advantage of speaking with both Jay and Marika. I have had many conversations and done a lot of business with them and have always been pleased with the outcome. They are a creative and professional group that offer more than just the metal.
__label__4	Delicious BBQ, yummy sides (baked beans, jalapeno mac 'n' cheese, collards), great prices!  I just wish it was bigger because so many people love it and it gets crowded, but some nice people let us sit with them and they were so sweet!!  The owner is really nice, always checking up on the customers, making sure everything is ok.  Great food!!
__label__4	This place is great for fast food pizza. The staff has always been super helpful and friendly. The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is it's not always clean in the dining room.
__label__4	"I had a few hours free before my flight and the New Orleans Museum of Art was recommended to me.  I was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed my visit very much.

Their permanent collection is not huge, but they have a very nice collection of European Masters, Flemish/Dutch, early American and African-American art.

I had a nice lunch in their dining room beforehand.  As it was a Friday afternoon, they had live music and a bar setup in the lobby for happy hour. 

Thanks, NOMA."
__label__4	"This is your typical small Starbucks.  True, it's not ""the thing to do"" in the French Quarter. But, if you work at the Canal Place mall, at Westin, or in the office tower and frequent this Starbucks, like I do, the staff will remember your name and your regular order.  That's all I ask for in a coffee shop."
__label__4	"I have been here 3 or 4 times and it is always good, I haven't had one thing I didn't enjoy yet.  The place is small and well decorated, the staff is friendly, the prices are great (especially if you make it for happy hour), and the food is very good.

I definitely recommend this place for sushi lovers."
__label__4	Decent little coffee shop in the heart of Medford. They roast there own and produce quality fresh roasts. Not sure I'd make the trek again, but if you're in the area it's worth the stop.
__label__4	Delicious. Fast and fresh! Went for a friends birthday and had a great time. The best part is that it's BYOB  and flat rate which makes it nice for larger groups and splitting the bill.
__label__4	"Nice little spot for me to catch breakfast. It's not crowded at 7 am at all. It's a new building so everything is super clean and the staff is super nice and fun. Also internet! 

The breakfast portions are a good size. Not the normal huge portions other New Orleans restaurants offer, but it makes me watch what I eat. Also, don't forget to pick up a rewards card if you see yourself becoming a regular. You get all sorts if freebies. My brother scored an extra pastry the other morning. C:"
__label__4	Crown Candy is a true treat. The sandwiches are OK, but you come here for the rich, frosty, huge shakes and malts, made with Crown's homemade ice cream. If you don't get there a few minutes before they open, expect at least a 30-minute wait for a booth -- it's tiny. The neighborhood is very safe during the day, and cops love this place.
__label__4	These guys do a great job on burgers, fries, and onion rings. The buns are very fresh, meat is delicious, and the condiments are amazing. Most are made in-house. they also have an interesting beer selection.
__label__4	"Food was pretty amazing I gotta say. BEST MENUDO I've ever ever had! And I've had hundreds! Tortillas so good but I took some
To go and they places them in a grocery bag and when I got home they were soggy! But the food was so good! Be prepared to pay a little more than the average Mexican food spot. Plates are from 13-20. Been there for breakfast and it's by far the best Mexican food breakfast I've had"
__label__4	I love jc nails.  They give the best foot and leg rubs here.  Now they even offer free beer while you get a mani/pedi!
__label__4	Pizza was delicious, affordable, and the owner was very personable. Definitely recommend this place for a quick family meal with flavor.
__label__4	Had a great time saturday.  Our waiter was enthusiastic and happy to be there.  Had a decent hour menu and wanted to try their gin thar they just ran out.  The craft beer menu was solid!  We ordered th FLT sandwich with blackened amberjack, fried green tomatoes, and a great sauce.  I will be back for sure.
__label__4	I really enjoyed the she crab soup. It was very rich, but there was so much delicious crab! Burger and grouper were both good. Service was very friendly and helpful.
__label__4	"Yummy....very good...think i found a nee resturant...the food is great n the price is spot on.....the rice is a little buttery ...i have to say better than chinese fried rice...this teriyaki chicken with hibachi shrimp...awesome!!!
A MUST TRY"
__label__4	First visit to table and top for a late lunch.  Gringo tacos were delish. Packed with spicy beef, tomatoes, lettuce, and cheddar. They could have been a bit warmer but still great tasting. We also tried the avocado fries that were crunchy, creamy, served with spicy ranch. Don't forget to try the Jalapeloma...
__label__4	"We went midday and had bar-seating; killer Bloody Mary and flavorful shrimp cocktail (coming from a ""shrimp snob"" who is picky about texture and flavor). No hesitation being repeat customers."
__label__4	When my father came down to visit me for vacation we went to Bourbon st. We decided to check this place out. When we went in we were greeted by a very friendly and attentive staff.  We had a seat at the window looking out on scenic Bourbon. The food was pretty awesome here,Still a bit pricey.  But compared to other restaurants in the french quarter I would say fairly reasonable.  This wasn't exactly my favorite restaurant but my dad still talks about this place so I guess it is good enough to give a positive review.
__label__4	Surprisingly excellent food and a great atmosphere!  If you haven't lunch or dinner at Wegman's before, you've been missing it!
__label__4	The captain's player is quite good with a nice broiled variety seafood dish. My husband had the Cajun bucket and thoroughly enjoyed that as well. Nice open air eating space on the river with friendly and attentive staff.
__label__4	"We ordered take out from here and the person whom answered the phone was on point. He was clear to understand. Our food was ready In 20minutes and was delicious.

We had the vegetable fried rice, walnut shrimp, spring rolls and Mongolian chicken. These were all really good no complaints!

We want to dine in soon and try new dishes"
__label__4	Quick seating and wait time for food. Coffee was amazing and so was the breakfast burrito. I was impressed by the service and the quality of food. Definitely a hidden gem for someone looking to grab an inexpensive brunch. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because it is cash only which there is an ATM in the restaurant anyway.
__label__4	I stayed at the Holiday Express in Bensalem last weekend. I really liked that it was near a variety of places to eat, and close enough to walk to. The staff was extremely nice, and helpful. The entire place from lobby to room was clean. The room was a suite, which is always nice. My stay there was very comfortable and pleasant, and the only suggestion I have is that if you like sleeping on flatter pillows, you should bring it with you. The pillows here are all huge! If thats what you like, this place is perfect!!
__label__4	Full room, lively crowd, owner in the mix like its supposedly be. A great dinner, attentive staff, lots of regulars. Good vibe. I was traveling through MO on my way to TX with a trailer in tow. Absolutely worth the detour.
__label__4	A bit hit or miss sometimes but when they hit their breakfasts are awesome. When they miss it is usually the wrong order combination or parts of food is cool. Definite go-back for me-I will take my chances because when they are good they are great. Plus the name has to make you smile even if you aren't a 420 person.
__label__4	"I love the food here.  I just found this place in PA.
I've been to the location in Delaware many times.
Nice place to watch my Philadelphia EAGLES"
__label__4	Went on a friday night. Nice atmosphere and not crowded. The seating against the wall gives you access to view everything and to people watch. A live guitarist was a nice touch. I had a margarita but I wasn't to happy with it. I took a sip of one of the mule drinks which was really nice. Ordered finger food. Pretzel and nachos which was fine. Nice to be away from the ybor crowd.
__label__4	"Oysters both raw and ""baked"" are very good. Fresh, no fishy taste or smell. The staff is friendly and attentive. Oh, and the beer selection is decent and served cold."
__label__4	Holy Calzone!!! They are gigantic and very good.  Took my kids and I made the poor choice to get chicken Alfredo which I was not impressed with, it didn't have a lot of flavor.  The kids however each got a calzone which one would of been enough for us all to share, so thankfully I just shared some of that deliciousness with them.  Staff is very friendly and owner is hands on working which is always good.  The atmosphere is super casual.  Very small place so great for kids and family.
__label__4	Nice large, clean nail spa where Tina was very fast, professional and good.   Thanks!
__label__4	"The White Devil has become my favorite pizza in the city. However, I have a trick up my sleeve... I take it to go and heat it up on a skillet on the stove top with tented tin foil. This crisps up the crust perfectly, and it no longer flops over when you hold it up.

I will still eat it fresh, but it is SO much better reheated. Just thought I'd share this tip for those of you who prefer a crisper crust."
__label__4	"Their garlic knots are amazing! Three knots and some sauce - although I'm a bit of a ""saucy"" person (love marinera ) so the container of sauce was on the small side, but when I asked for more, they freely gave me more! Freely given and received"
__label__4	Prompt, Professional, Informative, Knowledgeable and extremely neat while completing the water heater & other services.
__label__4	"During my visit to the big easy I had Merchat bookmarked as a breakfast option and I'm glad I made it. The space is modern with beautiful large windows facing the street. There is also a hallway space with additional seats. 

Eats: 
I had a french vanilla latte which was absolutely delicious. I also had the apple cinnamon sugar crepe which was okay, if I visit again I'll probably try something else. Good vibes."
__label__4	Not bad for a suburban pizza shop - can't give it 5 stars because just not as good as classic pizzerias in Philadelphia
__label__4	Love this place. Waiters and waitresses are very personable and pleasant. Always a nice treat to visit here. Food is magnificent as well, which is, of course, a plus.
__label__4	I read the review and we gave it a try. Loved it! Very good soups, and the prime rib was excellent with delicious mashed Yukon Gold potatoes.  We went to dinner late and everything was still so good.  The menu has a variety of items on it. I would really recommend it.
__label__4	"They are excellent in terms of quality but their prices are ridiculously high and seem to keep increasing.  I had an outdoor GFI fixture replaced and was charged $200.  Seriously?

I've updated my review.  After seeing my initial review, one of the owner's contacted me and apologized for the price.  She indicated that the electrician hadn't followed protocol to provide me with an price upfront and wanted to make sure she provided good business for her customers.  She adjusted the price to what we both thought was fair.  Now that is what I call GOOD BUSINESS - Trump take note!!!"
__label__4	As a new resident of the area, this store was a great find.  The staff in the store was helpful and pleasant.  This is the best Family Dollar store I have experienced since coming to Philadelphia.
__label__4	Delicious food, but a long wait! Understandable because of the work shortage. Never been here before today and it was delicious. Got the enchiladas and sat outside which was nice. I did like the drink station because you could add syrups to your drinks.
__label__4	Meh. Typical Target. Nothing special. Clean. Well lit. Organized. Friendly customer service. Its always got loads of clearance racks. I like that their fashion is stepping it up. Always carry good brands in cosmetics too. Though i can find these same brands cheaper online via Storenvy but...bygones. Even with the recent controversy surrounding the stores I'd rather be here than caught dead at Walmart down the road. So keep up the good work Target!
__label__4	Amazing date night spot, the only real suggestion I could make it to have more options coming out on their belt more often. I looked for a few meat based items for around 20 minutes before they came around
__label__4	Best pina colada in town! Really enjoyed every visit to the Palm. Drinks are good food is good. Right on the beach. Will be back again! and again... and again .....
__label__4	My husband & I went to American Freight after receiving one of their sales papers in the mail. The sectional we picked out was much better looking in person than we expected. Our sales person was attentive from the moment we walked in and gave us her undivided attention throughout. We were in & out in under 30 minutes!
__label__4	While waiting for my Amtrak to leave I set off on an adventure to find a good cup of coffee.  I didn't plan on walking this far but ended up well worth it.  The coffee was astounding, the blueberry scone was huge and delicious, and the staff was very polite and nice.  When I'm downtown and not going to rooster I'll definitely be stopping back through here!
__label__4	"Been here three times now.  Love the pigs head, pretzels and cheese, and pork pot pie.  Fried chicken and banh mi are just okay.

This place has a great atmosphere, unique cocktails (I like the one with the lemon sherbet), and good service.  Last time we tried the homemade softserve - grape and fior di latte twist.  So delicious.  

As I'm writing this, I'm realizing I need to go back.  Soon."
__label__4	Beware of the angry train conductor!!  Yelled and insulted adults in front of families while a guy was trying to return a lost cell phone.  So rude!!
__label__4	Very good Italian Hoagie and Cheese steak.  Both solid choices.  Good roll compared to some of the other local places.  Italian had peppered ham, cappicola and genoa which is the combination I like.  Cheesesteak had a good amount of meat and cheese melted into the steak.  Overall very good experience and would repeat
__label__4	Dueling pianos excellent, all 8 or 10 of them. Worth every tip they get.  Its Nashville for Gods sake what's not to love about the place, its talent, restaurants, hospitality.  I truly hate to give a 'negative' but here goes. The wait staff......ok that's about it. Not too friendly, I'll leave it at that.  I visit at least 3 times a year and hope to continue doing so. Well worth a try when on Broadway St.
__label__4	Great hang out spot. Love the happy hour, ceviche, and fast service, and local live bands.
__label__4	"The word ""Surprised"" doesn't even begin to describe how I felt after dining here.  It looks like a little hole in the wall, nothing special.  But OMG the food - and the service.  Such a wonderful cuisine, great prices and friendly staff.  I would absolutely recommend and dont judge the place until you have eaten there.  Try the pineapple stuffed with seafood (yes, it sounds weird but it is AMAZING) and the octopus and shrimp plate.  Such a great spot - will absolutely be back and recommend!"
__label__4	The açaí bowl is SO good, but it's SOOOOO expensive! It's not big enough to be worth $14 in my opinion. But I would highly recommend getting it if you don't care about price!
__label__4	Great place for coffee.  The vibe, people and service are also awesome!
__label__4	"Brah when you're pounding beers back and drinking hand grenades nothing in the world matters more than the question ""Where's the food at?"" Well you found it damn it! With over several locations on Bourbon street, there's no reason you should be waiting in line at any other place. Order your food, high five your brahs, fist pump, eat food, REPEAT."
__label__4	"Visited Flyte for the first time and the food was delicious.  Everything tasted fresh and service was good.  As others have mentioned, the portions are on the small side so everyone at our table was still hungry for dessert.  

I was disappointed that a restaurant as upscale as Flyte did not periodically check the status of the rest rooms.  The ladies room had no paper towels at all, and someone had placed a roll of toilet tissue at the sink for hand drying.  Of course, that left the stall without toilet tissue.  The room just needed a staff member to make a quick check of the facilities, but that was not happening."
__label__4	"Great venue to catch a game (pro or college) or a concert.  There are seating options to accommodate all budgets, and the concession stand prices wont empty your wallet.

Ditto Jon, great beer options and rockin' pep band."
__label__4	I suppose I should know the name of the dishes that a place serves before I write a review, but I don't know all of the Indian names for their cuisine.  I DO know that this little place up in Carmel is the absolute best Indian restaurant I've been to.  Really flavorful, fresh and interesting dishes.  Their lunch buffet is fantastic, and has a huge variety.  The buffet, plus drink is less than $12.  If you want a great Indian buffet for lunch, this is the place.
__label__4	I Love my apartment and the management! They have gone above and beyond for me which I greatly appreciate! The only complaint I have is the noise can be a little much at times. However, I live by the pool and I think it is to be expected on some level that this is a louder area. Most all my needs are met by Domain. I have lived here for 2 years and just signed for another year :)
__label__4	"Basic subs but great friendly staff get an extra star.  
Minus one star for Pepsi Products.  
Fresher than subway.  Slower than Jimmy Johns.   Tastier than both."
__label__4	Really small and hidden gem. They fit me in last minute and my nails turned out great
__label__4	I forgot to check in when i came...but regardless this was a nice experience. Quite pricy, but it's a fancy place. We ordered four dishes, rather small(that's the point of the place...order multiple small dishes so you can try more). Everyone really took care of us! The desert was truly the best i have ever had!! it was a chocolate ball filled with ice cream, neatly placed on top of a cookie, and hot caramel was used to melt the chocolate...seriously to die for.
__label__4	This is my second visit here, it's a great appetizer/ light meal place. All the food was fresh and well prepared, the only downside was the loud hip hop playing. We could barely carry on a conversation.
__label__4	"This was our 1st visit and we will be back. Was it THE BEST Sushi I have ever had ~ No...BUT was it really GOOD~ Yes!
A great value and freshly made. Probably the best Shrimp Tempura I have had and the Hot and Sour Soup is SPICY with great taste!
Great friendly service!!"
__label__4	Good general experience. I like the feel of the place a lot, no pressure, just eat and leave. the staff was very friendly and efficient. Those burgers were ready in less than 5 minutes. We got two number 2s (cheeseburger, fries, and shake). Burger looks small, but it is plenty to fill you up since the meat patty was really thick (but still juicy). Truffle fries were the bomb, a little salty up top though. The shakes were rich and creamy and I couldn't finish off mine (chocolate) because i was that full.
__label__4	For a Taco Bell that only deals with college students, this location does extremely well. Open late, consistently friendly to students, and pretty quick with the orders. Other reviews say they have problems getting sauce packets but I have not experienced that issue and have been here 100 times. Perfect for late night munchies. The one time I have had a problem here, I called corporate and they corrected it. No problems with this location.
__label__4	Really yummy food.  I like the coconut soup... not sure of the official name but it's good.  I got the panang chicken and it was suuper tasty.  We also got some rice with pineapple and also say-tay chicken and a curry thing.  It was all tasty.  There were 4 if us and we paid about 20$ each for a TON of food.
__label__4	New Orleans has a lot of amazing food but it lacks solid pizza. This place is great! It's in the middle of a bit of a sketchy residential neighborhood. It doesn't matter. Stick this in your google maps and come check it out. For the dairy free folks they have daiya cheese. It's a bit sweet but definitely worth giving it a shot. This is not for the thick crusted pizza lovers. This is good thin crust pizza. I'll definitely go back.
__label__4	Super friendly and accommodating staff!!!!! I wish the Cajun wings had more flavor, don't hold out on us !!
__label__4	"Fiji Hana hibachi. I have been here a few times. The service is always very friendly. We took my parents for their first foray into hibachi. They loved the food and the ""show."" Typical hibachi moves like the onion volcano, onion train, fire, egg juggling, and more fire. The hibachi rice could use more flavor but add the mixed veggies in with it and it is vastly improved. You'll leave fat and happy, even if you miss catching the rice in your mouth."
__label__4	"Love this place - friendly staff, it's always spotless, service is quick and they get your order right.

I was in today and my regular order was (slightly) delayed for one reason or another - the staff apologized several times, even though there really was no need to, and the manager comped my drink and apologized again on my way out. That's great customer service!"
__label__4	We go here fairly often. Plenty of dining options as well as shopping. The center does a great job offering community events as well which are mostly free.
__label__4	This review is for when I visited back in 2017. It's an interesting place to explore and enjoy nice views. We saw some people having a picnic, it looked like a good place to have one!
__label__4	Ive been here once, The pizza was ok. Nothing special, but filled me up. staff was frienldy
__label__4	First time trying this place today. Avocado salad was great, especially the dressing. The tuna tataki was ok, a little fishy but not bad. One issue I have is that there was 5 small pieces of tuna. When I have ordered it from other places I would get a whole to go box of it. I was still hungry unfortunately today so that would be great if they could increase the quantity since the price is $9.50 just for the tuna.
__label__4	Good place for lunch and when you are trying to not eat 4000 calories. The location is extremely clean and there's a beautiful view of the water and resort & spa across the street. Good was average but edible. Service was good. Parking can get a little hectic though.
__label__4	After taking a break from the cafe for a while, I have returned to see salt and pepper on the tables!! Hallelujah!! The food AND service are still great! Over the years, I have never experienced the negative feedback that some reviewers have given.  No one has ever been rude to me and yes, sometimes there is a normal wait when the place is busy but it is not anything out of the ordinary.  Treat yourself to breakfast here, and bring your family.  It is a great place!
__label__4	Haven't been here since they opened. We got here around 11:30. There was a little wait but not too bad. Waiter we had was very quick. He got our drink orders right away and our glasses never went empty. Took a little long for our food to come out, however they were a little busy. Food was good, the side of bacon I asked for to be crispy was perfect. Husband had the Loco Moco and I had the Spinach Omelette. I would definitely recommend.
__label__4	Good service. Food in great. Beer selection is out of this world. The great thing about this place is the wait staff continuously keeps a cup filled with water for you. I love that in that it keeps the hangover down. The water refills is something that will keep me coming back.
__label__4	Great tuna melt & breakfast/brunch. The staff is very kind & attentive. I need to visit here more often :)
__label__4	Our first visit to Tucson, Az and this was  highly recommended place by a student who went to the nearby Az university.  Very nice friendly place. Service, Food and ambiance was great.  Salsa made at the table was delicious!  Food portions are very good in size too. Overall very good experience.
__label__4	"I thought this Hampton Inn was nice however I had  one thing I think they could improve on.

1. Put meat on the Breakfast buffett
2. Need better signs on how to get to the parking lot

Other then that the beds are very comfortable and the wifi worked great. The place is clean and tidy."
__label__4	I love waffles and this place meets my waffle expectations! We ordered a few different things all were really good. Customer service was pretty good,  that's always an important factor. I will definitely return again soon.
__label__4	"The best fish tacos ever. My wife and a make up reasons to head to South common just so we can grab a few fish tacos!! 
Also the best eggs benny hands down!! I always ask for extra hollandaise sauce - guilty pleasure!! 
Great staff, loud and busy atmosphere!"
__label__4	Interesting mix of cuisines. The restaurant has a pedestrian sushi menu in addition to creole favorites. This is my forth visit to the restaurant. The service is hit and miss. The staff seems very casual, and not so attentive. My favorite is the Mac n cheese with crawfish.
__label__4	I've tried dish 19 and 23, the tofu soup (23) tasted good that I believe it was just the same as what I have had in Seoul. And the sweet potato noodle (19) was unexpectedly delicious, I had been wondering what kind of sauce had been added, maybe shrimp sauce or so. Next time I think I will have one more 19.
__label__4	I frequently visit Spiro's and absolutely love the quality of food and service. Spiro and his wife Bok are often present and provide friendly customer interaction. They have an excellent happy hour and football specials. There is also Karaoke on weekends, which is fun and popular.  I highly recommend the Gyro, but all of the menu items I have tried have been excellent.
__label__4	The Happy hour margaritas are truly amazing! The food is also a great value with excellent quality. The salsa bar is so good! The only improvement I would suggest is to have more servers so that you could get faster service. Other than that I would say truly wonderful!
__label__4	This review is for their happy hour, which we went to twice. The charbroiled oysters are a must ($1.50 each) and the oysters are also good ($1.00 each). Consistent quality. Excellent service and really friendly folks.
__label__4	"This place is awesome! So fun! Who knew Fishtown could be so ""cool?!?!"" Came here for a quick drink before dinner plans in Center City. I wish we did not have dinner rsvp, because the food here looks painfully amazing (think German comfort food). I will have to come back. Damn you Stephen Starr with your cool restaurants that I always end up eating at.

I would give this place 5-stars, but there was no dark stouts on tap at either of the bars. That's a big no-no in my book."
__label__4	Lovely spot. Warm tortilla chips and salsa upon sitting. Super friendly staff. The food is super basic Mexican. Nothing fancy, but also not greasy and gross.
__label__4	"I have seen this place while driving down First Avenue, and since the decor is so unusual I paid special attention and dropped in for a menu.I read reviews online, and then went back for a take out salad with shrimp on top. 
It was very good, not spicy, and the shrimp were huge. (just the teeniest bit tough but good tasting) PS: I have tinnitus so sitting in a restaurant, I can't hear my dinner companion.  I need very quiet restaurants. If that's true for you, do take out!"
__label__4	"New spot in Abington and we recently ordered.  The food was good and the churros were very good.  A lot of Mexican food competition in the area from Qdoba, Chipotle and Senor Salsas.  
I will go back again because the location is very convenient and I am not a fan of Chipotle."
__label__4	We primarily stopped here and loved it because of the name. Yes, we are Shameless fans. And this might be as close to The Alibi Room that we'll ever get. It's divey, it's a tad seedy, it's the drinking alibi you've been looking for. Decent beer offerings. Friendly enough bartenders. Not too crowded, not too empty. Not too dirty, not too clean. There's really not much to complain about. If you like dive bars, be sure to check this place out.
__label__4	"I'm here for the cold brewed coffee, and theirs is delicious. Ask for a pump of caramel in the bottom - yum. Adds just a bit of sweetness!

This location is super convenient to campus - so, definitely slower and more relaxed in the summer. The adjoining outdoor patio with covered tables is the perfect place to grab a quick coffee drink or meet up with a friend or colleague. 

They also have some treats for your enjoyment - I sampled a blueberry/lemon scone on one occasion and it was tasty and light."
__label__4	"Barbara's is just good ole cooking. The poppy seed chicken is a must have and the rolls are good, but not light and fluffy, so pace yourself! 
If you get lucky you will be there when the cobbler comes out of the oven. If that happens, order it, doesn't matter what kind of cobbler, you won't be disappointed!"
__label__4	"Awesome burgers and fries.  Burger was juicy with lots of toppings to choose from on a brioche roll, really really good.  Hot fries perfectly cooked, even better than other burger joints like Five Guys.

Highly recommended!"
__label__4	Had to wait about an hour and a half past my appointment time but once I got in it only took about 10 minutes. Would go there again next year.
__label__4	The pizza is consistent here and the staff is always friendly when I stop in. When my wife was extremely pregnant and hungry, they stayed open late for us to come by for a pick-up order. You can tell the owners value their customers. The inside decor s kind of outdated, however, the consistency of the pizza makes up for that.
__label__4	Tuesdays are the day to go for $5 movies. Reserved seats, comfy chairs, and decent service. Pretty great overall. Construction has the parking lot destroyed right now, but that should be done pretty soon. My current go-to movie theater.
__label__4	How does one review a football team on Yelp? Hm... for the enjoyable experience of escaping the grading of high school papers, I went to a Colts game, and admit that it was indeed enjoyable to watch. Now, if we were to grade them on performance, success, etc., that would indeed be a very different story. They are the NFL representatives of our beloved Indianapolis, and even though you may not want to admit it, but they are part of the representation of Indy, one of the finest sports capitals in the world. For that, good job and play on.
__label__4	We discovered Caddy's in Gulfport early in our 10-day stay in the area. Newly opened, we ended up eating breakfast there three times (biscuits and gravy, avocado toast, French toast, omelette, all great) and also went for a few happy hours after hanging out at the beach.  We had good service and really enjoyed the upper level views. The only drawback: lots of cigarette smoke all around us. Wish that was not allowed. Check out Caddy's!
__label__4	This place has great sandwiches, great sodas, a huge selection of beer, and amazing sweet tea.  My favorite is the turkey avocado. The only issue with this place is there are never any open seats!  When it's nice outside there are plenty of outdoor tables.
__label__4	It didn't have the charm some of the smaller restaurants have, but the service was good, very friendly and the food was great!
__label__4	"Ike's is legit. Great recipes, quality ingredients, friendly staff.
We like to try a new sandwich every time we go in and they are always adding new ones.
But dont worry they will make any sandwich you like.
The dutch crunch is great. Baked fresh every day."
__label__4	Exactly what I expect from a take out place. Food is hot, pizza is tasty and fries are crispy and never soggy.
__label__4	Two clean do it yourself stalls plus an automatic bay. I used one of the manual stalls and was satisfied with the amount of soap dispensed for the high pressure wash and the water pressure was sufficient to remove the sun dried bug remains after a 500 mile drive in the hot sun.
__label__4	I highly disagree with any negative review. This guy is the real deal and his food is equally the real deal. The Chinese style wonton awesome. The steamed clams in sauce is excellent. But this guy makes DUCK like no other. I can only find Duck like this down at 10th & Race!!! (CHINATOWN) for rookies... People really need to think before slamming a guy with such a negative.. Thank God I didn't listen to this dope who slammed Chinatown Cafe. I would have missed this little Gem in the Burbs...
__label__4	A really nice location to hang out hence the 4 stars, especially on a good weather. Not much view to see. Surrounding buildings give shade on a sunny afternoon. Food was mediocre, chicken wasn't too greasy and enough flavoring that I don't have to use any sauce. The sugar bacon wasn't as good as I thought. I would come back for the place but not for the food.
__label__4	I'm a big fan of any place you can visit for your morning coffee, lunch, and happy hour all in one. Their prepared food case is awesome when you need to grab something quick. I chose the rice noodles with chicken and it was fresh and filling for only $7. The vibe is friendly, bright, and cozy and would be perfect for a date or a business meeting. The only reason for 4 stars is that the coffee is a little pricey for what you get, although delicious.
__label__4	Great experience!  Staff member asks what you are looking for and then starts pulling suits that she thinks will work for you.  You just hang out in the change room while she brings you suggestions.  They provide honest feedback, which I really appreciate.  I wish they had more cover-ups but, honestly, the bathing suit selection is the best in the Edmonton area and so I'm not complaining.  I'm grateful!
__label__4	Bottos is a very good restaurant for a couple or family. Food is great and service is good! The cafe offers great options from music on the weekends to sports games daily. Which includes the NFL games on Sunday!
__label__4	I really like burger king breakfast get a good amount of food for your money. Also the staff seems pretty nice and inviting
__label__4	Went Saturday for the prime rib special-a great deal at under $20.00. It was excellent,and a huge portion. With the loaded potato,we each brought half of each home for another night. Cooked rare,the beef was excellent,I can't say that I am a big fan of the management team-not particularly friendly or outgoing-but the food and service is good for a mid priced restaurant
__label__4	Stayed here 5/5-5/8/18...overall pleasant experience. Typical run of the mill 3 star hotel. Our flight got in at 5 am and we were able to check in early with no additional charge; that was definitely a plus! Complimentary breakfast was decent and did the job to hold us over until we were ready to leave the hotel to get real food. Walking distance to good restaurants and the French Quarter.
__label__4	New life thrift store and I are like old friends from neighborhoods. I've been going here for about 15+years. I love this place for 3 reasons. I. Nostalgia, it's been the go-to thrift store for me for years so it's hard not to like it. 2. It's a very good place for knick knacks, such as books, kitchen things, etc. 3. Good seasonal things, especially fall and winter holidays. As all thrift stores go, shop often and look hard!
__label__4	"Wonderful delicious treat! Super cute store in the heart of 12 south. Super friendly staff. They DO take cards contrary to some older posts :)  
Highly recommend the Avocado cream popsicle the fruit ones look amazing too!
The ONLY reason I gave is 4 stars and not 5 is due to the tiny size of the Popsicles and the $3.50 price. They're seriously tiny, like kid sized."
__label__4	"Friendly staff and good drinks. I got the chai tea and it had good flavor. I also got their orange roll which was very good. 

The atmosphere was nice. A bit small but a good selection of tables to choose from."
__label__4	I went with a group of 6 ppl, half of us got entrees and the other half got sushi. Sushi was good, not amazing, would order again. Entrees were amazing, I got the spicy chicken, which wasn't really spicy but it still had really good flavor. Service was good, drinks stayed full no issues on food.
__label__4	Very solid breakfast joint.  Hot coffee refills frequently.  Friendly staff.   Country fried steak skillet was excellent.
__label__4	If you like Annata, you'll probably like Alto Mare.  They have a similar happy hour to Annata with their legendary $3 glasses of wine from 4 pm - 6 pm.  They also have a handful of items for happy hour.  I had the Fish Taco which were three tacos with blackened cod.  They were quite tasty.  I wasn't very hungry so that's all I ate but I saw a lot of the food come out and it looked great.  They have quite a bit more space at the bar than Annata does so this is a good option for when they get full.
__label__4	Very causal order and pickup joint. They smoke the food on a truck yes!!! The meat is sooo tender. I had a  juicy half bird and it was so flavorful it didn't even need BBQ sauce! They have a lot sauces too!
__label__4	Polite baristas and pretty good pizza but a little pricey.  Beautiful space to bring your laptop and work for a bit.  I wish they had better hot chocolate--more chocolate and less cloyingly sweet--and a better selection of pastries and snacks.  I also wish they'd get rid of the big screen tv upstairs and expand their music playlist.  Still, it is a fine and necessary addition to the neighborhood.  East Falls suffers from a lack of places where you can grab a cup of coffee and some grub and work in peace for a few hours.
__label__4	By far my favorite pho place in sparks. My wife and I happened to stop in here on a whim, and since we normally have to brave downtown for pho, we were so glad when this place was actually good! 4 stars only because it can be hard to get refills at times and the spring rolls are good, but not the best.
__label__4	"This is our go-to pizza spot for take-out in The Park! Sure there are lots of other places to choose from but staff are friendly and pizza is great. They also have a garlic butter dipping sauce that our kids love to use on their pizza crust -- it can be swapped out for another flavour though (ranch, etc.).

Be sure to order online for additional specials -- our fav is Web Wednesday with 25% off."
__label__4	Great little spot! Went for breakfast, all the traditional menu items and some custom creations. Really good foods with some outdoor seating.
__label__4	"We have only ordered online & picked up. 
Never had any issues with our food or the service so far in over a dozen visits. Food has been hot, fresh & tasty. Big portions & good prices. They get the important stuff right!"
__label__4	"I was a little worried when we got our dinner before the appetizer, but the food was so good I can hardly complain. Great place at a convenient location in Nashville. They also had heat lamps that made it warm enough for us to sit outside on a chilly day in April! It got pretty crowded by the time we left. Highly recommend - only reason it's 4 instead of 5 is the service was a littttle iffy. Food makes up for it, though!

OH YEAH AND GET THE PRETZEL AND DIP IT IN THE CHEESE. You're welcome."
__label__4	Beautiful dining room. Fantastic neighborhood. Food selection was diverse and tasty. Specials of fish and steak were really good.
__label__4	So glad to have a hot pot close by.  Incredible variety of vegetables, fresh fish and meat.  I wasn't inspired by the staff: they couldn't explain the concept or how it works.  Hope they keep this place around.
__label__4	Went to San Kee for lunch. The bento box was an outrageously delicious meal! For the price of only 13 dollars we had a lot of food. I had a peking duck roll; which was delicious, the ginger and scallion noodles; which were also delicious, and the general tao's chicken. I had enough to take some home. My wife had wonton soup, dumplings and shrimp in garlic sauce. Her meal was also outstanding with enough to take home. I can't wait to try the dinner menu.
__label__4	Nice selection, nice staff.  My only issue is one time I brought in a watch for a battery to be replaced.  They did it in 10 min for $8.  I brought back the same watch 2 years later and it took them until the next day to do and it cost $16, just to replace the battery.
__label__4	Good lunch spot in east Nashville. Meat and 3 place with quality food. Definitely recommend for a speedy lunch but get there early or wait in line!
__label__4	"It was a really cute venue with a decent catalog. They're new so I'm guessing more songs will come soon. The decor is amazing and I love that there are private rooms. 
The only issues were the heat kept coming on in our room which made it super hot. They would turn the AC on but the heat came back on at least twice. Would suggest turning the heat off and getting fans in the room.
Also, the drinks were a bit pricey. 
I would definitely go back once the kinks were fixed!"
__label__4	My goto destination for mooncakes! The tarts are delicious, too. The only thing is I got the pineapple buns with custard filling and the inside bread part touching the filling is slightly undercooked. =/
__label__4	"My favorite Mexican joint in Carmel. Prompt service. Good food. No worries.

The Unknown Diner digs it."
__label__4	awesome beer selection, lots of regional and local beers.  I didn't try the food.
__label__4	This just opened up a few weeks ago, and they sell fudges and hot chocolate and tea.  It's got cute decor.
__label__4	"I go here for the cheese plate, which is probably sacrilege.  But I will do anything for an epic cheese plate and BurgerUp's is one of the most epic of them all.   

Of course the patty melt I had for mains was excellent as well, so they do make an awesome burger.  

The only reason I give 4 instead of 5 stars is because it's not a great environment indoors.   The patio is nice; a lot more relaxed and much quieter, but the smell of bottled gas from the kitchen can get pretty intrusive."
__label__4	This place isn't that bad. Our waitress was very nice and the food was pretty good.  They have a good selection of beer. Hookah was good but were out of what we originally ordered. My only gripes: Only two bathrooms in the whole place,  if you go with a small party you are seated in a room that is not as nice as the others,  the tables are small and low and seating is uncomfortable,  plus no belly dancers in there, music in there was kinda lame. There was a ten dollar cover charge,  went on  Saturday night.
__label__4	"Driving thru Boise on summer on my way to Olympia, WA - there were two things I was looking for:  A nice cold pint ( check ) and perhaps a record store ( check ).  Found both and was quite impressed with the record store.  Great selection, a good size, and loads of used CDs.  Worth a visit for anyone who appreciates music in general.
I bet Doug Martsch, members of State of Confusion/Treepeople or even Pushead bought LPs back in the day at this record store...."
__label__4	Always good eats and the bar has plenty beers on tap to satisfy your thirst. Downsides are parking can be a hassle if the mall is busy.
__label__4	"For me, this is my favorite dining joint at this mall.

Immaculately clean, expect slick service and an awesome variety of avant-garde and imaginative CA-style pizzas.

I often find myself craving that wonderful Thai chicken pizza.

Well worth a try!  You will be back..."
__label__4	"Good old greasy spoon! wonderful people and service. beats the hell out of a dennys or IHOP.
A little bit of everything on the menu! Enjoy!"
__label__4	Good creole food, mixing American with Cajun and Vietnamese, this restaurant is classy and fun.  It was, however, a little overpriced for the amount of food provided.  Still I would recommend giving it a shot!
__label__4	The BEST chicken and chicken salad ever. It always smells so delicious and it tastes as good. Love this place. The service can be slow so just be patient and enjoy the aroma!
__label__4	"It's a college pizza joint. You'll be surprised by the taste. If there's not a party where you're eating it, there will be one in your mouth! 

But here's the catch, do everything in your power to get your hands on fresh pizza, even if that means ordering a full pie, because during the summer flies might get to the pay by the slices before you do....

Either than that, one of the guys that works there, has one of the coolest longest beards I've ever seen!"
__label__4	We found this lovely seafood market gem tucked in a side street in the west end. They have a fairly large selection of mostly frozen seafood, along with fresh oysters -- will try them another time! We bought a bag of frozen shrimp and they were very good. Do recommend that you rinse them really really well as they were frozen in a salt water glaze to reduce/prevent freezer burn and were a bit salty. Prices are reasonable--pretty much what I'd expect to pay for good seafood in the landlocked prairies! Next time we may have to try the octopus!
__label__4	Very friendly, fast and thorough. I'd go back. I discovered the salon through groupon. It's fairly new and has only been there for a month. I made an appt but was 30 min early. They took me early with no problems. The employees were very nice and took the time to massage my feet and hands during both the mani and pedi. They also use hot towels which I love. Thanks QQ
__label__4	"Seemingly authentic, tasty African food in a really cozy, cute atmosphere. At the recommendation of our waitress, we ordered a dish with beef and spinach over coconut rice and plantains (can't remember the name!). It was really delicious and at $16 was more than enough food for two. The fried plantain appetizer was fantastic and the black-eyed pea fritters were solid as well. The ginger and red zinger juices were very refreshing. 

We'd come again!"
__label__4	Food was delicious would recommend it for my friends my family. Seating is nice too. just they don't have access for my sons stroller which was a little pain but overall its great experience.
__label__4	Good atmosphere. Before Studio 34 I have never taken a yoga class before. After roughly six months of classes I'm still impressed. The diversity in instructors, the friendly nature of the staff and the community feel of the studio made my experience enjoyable. Starting out  the task of selecting a studio can be intimidating, I would suggest giving Studio 34 a shot.
__label__4	"This is my kind of toy store!  

I stopped in to pick up a new Bare Mineral's Foundation, and while there, I got to look through the new trends out there! I love seeing what the color trends are and what new shades and styles will be.  They have one of the best nail bars out there. 

Service is always tops!"
__label__4	"*Friendly and professional staff
*$$ but for a pretty generous size smoothie
*Never crazy busy when I go
*Impressed by their business hours for a Smoothie Cafe
*Drive-thru conveniency
*Have gotten probably 10 or more of their superfood smoothies (Island Green) in just one month alone
* 3 words to describe their smoothies-Addictive, Nutritious, Mouth Watering.. okay 4 words haha
*Only downfall.. I wish they did punch cards for smoothies"
__label__4	Great place for breakfast, you have to try the pancakes!The best I have had in years, although very large they are so light and fluffy that I could have eaten 3 , eggs bacon and omelettes all very good and the service was great, will be back.
__label__4	Food and service is great. It gets busy so keep that in mind. You'll have to wait si plan in advance.
__label__4	This restaurant was a pleasure of food from start to finish.  Staff was on point with service.  Chargrilled Oysters were delicious.  Lobster and Crawfish Ravioli had such wonderful flavor. Definitely will go there again
__label__4	Strawberry icecream was nice and creamy without being overly sweet.  Variety of flavors like icecream cake, peanut butter, cookies and cream, etc.
__label__4	Look... I messed up and forgot to post this review from way back when.  But GO! I remember that much.  I like the place so much that I'm planning my next New Orleans trip around it.  I do remember it being a little expensive, so save your chips.
__label__4	"Love the decor and the modern feel of the space. 
There is also a 2nd restaurant on-site that has killer fried chicken.

Tried the paneer, and some grilled items. It was a little salty for my taste personally. I've tried their butter chicken at a Yelp event prior and I honestly regret not ordering that again... the butter chicken was delicious and is going to be my go to next time!"
__label__4	"I stopped here for lunch and I ordered the special. The pulled pork quesadilla. It was so delicious. The pulled pork was definitely homemade. Flavorful. Very juicy. A perfect compliment to the quesadilla. 
Service was rather slow, and I was on a time crunch because I had to head back to work. The restaurant could have been cleaner as well. The booth seating was very greasy. Could definitely use a wipe down."
__label__4	Some dishes were great (goat cheese brûlée, gnocchi) others were just ok (tri-tip). But the service was good, the atmosphere is nice (although just a little loud), and the drinks were fantastic. I would like to check out their happy hour.
__label__4	"I ordered a cheeseburger on french bread and onion rings. 

I have zero complaints.

NB: Jimmy Buffett rates the burger at Rotier's in his ""top 10 of all time."""
__label__4	Be careful of those Absinthe drinks!!!  They are extremely delicious, but they don't hit you for a while, and when it finally catches up to you, it hits you HARD.
__label__4	Must get the mussels and honestly the best dirty martini I've had in ages! Perfectly balanced. Very romantic and cozy atmosphere, also.
__label__4	Get happy my vegan and vegetarian friends- this is the place for you! We over- order here because everything on the menu sounds delicious. Empanadas, street tacos, amazing hummus. Super cute decor, sit in or out. Staff is warm and knowledgeable. Parking can be tricky, so be patient or creative.
__label__4	My my my.. I'm so loving the concept of wine and killer desserts in a lovely atmosphere.  These treats are fresh, not made days ago sitting in some freezer.  Enjoy! I've had the carrot cake and the Cheesecakes!
__label__4	If you like small cozy restaurants, then Rue 127 is the place for you! The tiny restaurant is located in an old shotgun house and is barely larger than my apartment (which is tiny, btw). But, the service was excellent and the food was tasty! I got the gumbo with potato salad, then the scallops and finished the meal with the apple crunch. I also had a delicious blueberry cocktail with dessert that was creamy and the perfect compliment to the apple crunch (I wish I could remember what it was called...) I highly recommend this place!
__label__4	"This has place has fantastic beer, all the brews are super tasty- pure ingredients and dope ass varieties/ definitely creative 

The patio is awesome as well, in the direct sunlight and has tables / cornhole / and ping pong - sweet soundtracks too and so much space 

5 stars for the beer, 4 stars cause they don't accept cash"
__label__4	Ive been to this place a couple times now. Burgers are pretty darn good. Definitely your classic burger. Greesy as can be vut tasty. Serves is always good and drinks are cheap. They have a Cuban sandwich special during the week. Good Cuban. It gets pretty crowded but the place is big so you will always find a seat. Dont just try the burgers. They have an extensive menu of fantastic food!
__label__4	"The bakery has awesome pate chaud( French stuffed meat pastry). The restaurant side has a very large variety of food too. I like their rice combo dishes. It's really  good. Even though it's a Vietnamese restaurant. Lol. The rice plates comes with rice n different meats. They are really generous with their portions too. The only draw back is their always understaffed. Which I find annoying. The food takes awhile. But then again I don't mind the wait bcz the food is great!!!

Ps. My husband fav is Com #7"
__label__4	"In eat here very time I stay at the Peppermill. They have great sandwiches. I typically enjoy their chicken noodle soup. The last couple times I noticed they are now using penne pasta noodles for the soup. These are way too big! They are twice the size of the spoon. Its hard to eat them. Please go back to using the other noodles you used to use. 
Otherwise its great!"
__label__4	Nice cozy place. Beer  selection is good.  Food is solid. I got the veggie wrap..yum...fun fries. The staff is super friendly. Would go there again for sure.
__label__4	Great Deli, and I agree with Ray L. same line at DiNici's and Hershel's was only 10 mins.  Great corned beef, pastrami I would definitely drive to Philly from Bethlehem just for Hershel's.
__label__4	Great spot to hang at near the art museum. Went on Sunday to watch the games and wasn't disappointed. 20 flat screens through out the restaurant really lets you keep up on the action. The menu is very affordable compared to other sports bars in town and is actually very good. Thinking about heading over for the Super Bowl.
__label__4	Good Staff, good beers, nice place for gatherings, roomy
__label__4	I love a good cheese danish and Cafe Mozart did not disappoint. Service is always quick and they have a drive thru.
__label__4	If you authentic Chinese food, go for it. Pin Wei is one of the best in the area. If you want American Chinese, it's available, what's the point, that's not their specialty.
__label__4	A neighborhood haunt - love the chicken and waffles, the Sunday brunch with either bloody Mary's or mimosas are refreshing.  The service is expedient and friendly. Happy to recommend this establishment.
__label__4	Covid review: definitely make a reservation. Love the food and drinks here. They are very knowledgeable on their cheeses. I love that. They still are using paper menus though- so just wish they would change that.
__label__4	"Funky and super tiny but lots to choose from.
You can go down a couple of doors to Shere Punjab to be inspired on what to buy here.
Nice people are ready to help.
Lots of basics for good Indian food."
__label__4	Had the sweet n sour chicken combo. Won ton soup, egg roll and fried noodles were excellent!!
__label__4	Great food, fantastic atmosphere! Fun place to be! Get the crab- stuffed mushrooms. The crusted chicken with brussels was chickalicious. Good wine selections. We had a very large group and could have used another server. Super friendly wait staff. Good for adults and families.
__label__4	Such a fun place! The hibachi is a blast and  the chefs so talented! Everyone here is also super nice!! I got the salmon which was good! But we really came for the experience!
__label__4	We had the oysters and the shrimp tortellini. They were both good. One of us did not remember that they didn't like oysters, but that is okay. Our waiter's humor was a little odd, but he was nice. It is right in the French Quarter.
__label__4	Brilliant idea! Pricey but yummy. I got in and out on my scooter but it was a bit rough, so not really good for accessibility, but doable for some. Cookies were excellent. I cannot eat ice cream, so this is more guess than experience, but the ice cream sandwiches looked yummy.
__label__4	"HAD to try Culvers since we don't have this fast food chain in Cali or NYC

their frozen custard is good! they have vanilla & chocolate at all times BUT also a flavor of the day for those who need a change
--salted caramel almond: the name of the flavor speaks for itself 
--single patty cheddar bacon burger: i liked the crispy thin patty but the bread was a bit too dense
--cheese curds: deep fried balls of cheese, reminded me more of mini cheese sticks than cheese curds, just okay

solid fast food!"
__label__4	"Very good in every aspect. Black and Blue burger was fantastic. Great atmosphere and decor. Busy at lunch.  Had to sit at the bar - which showed their great beer selection. 

Would definitely go back.  My customer loves the place."
__label__4	Very Good Food! My boyfriend and I went there for our one year anniversary and was pleasantly surprised by the sushi and food. Even though the atmosphere was much to be desired but the service and food was DELICIOUS!! My boyfriend and I will be back!!
__label__4	My go-to pho place. I've been all over town and this place just knows how to make pho broth. Not too salty just perfect. The side offerings are fresh and the place is new so it's clean and nice.
__label__4	"For the restaurant... Outdoor  breezy, shaded seating for at least 100. There is crushed red pepper and grated permesean by the cash registers for the pizza, but they are equally good, if not better, on the dogs.

It reminds me of that time I ran into Senator John McCain and David Hasselhoff in the United airport lounge, and we were all completely drunk, but different."
__label__4	If you are looking for something different with a country rustic feel, this might be it. I don't know how they got that pick up truck suspended in the lounge.  This place serves comfort food, such as beans and coleslaw and baked potato with your meals.  Wings are huge and battered.  Steaks look like good value.  Menu was extensive.  Servers in the lounge were very friendly.  Country music playing.  Cozy log cabin feel.  They have have daily food and beer specials.  TVs in the lounge.  I think they close around 10:00pm.
__label__4	Real Southern style home cooking at decent prices. Jambalaya and stuffed peppers were delish. I wonder what that Alligator sausage tastes like? Don't say chicken ....
__label__4	Our first visit here was OK, but our second was much better! I think they're getting a better system and operations as they are up and running longer. We came on Saturday evening for appetizers and they were quite good. The bar was quite active as well and we enjoyed a drink there after we ate.
__label__4	the often overlooked brother of rittenhouse, a good place to have a catch since there are less people. there's a starbucks a block west on walnut to get a water, coffee, or use the restroom. the sprinklers are fun to run through at night in the summer, but watch for ghosts.
__label__4	I came in here because I love the mitch-match feel of it and also because I wanted to sit in the swing chairs. It's a great ambiance. The food is average, nothing special, but I've never had anything that I didn't like. I LOVE their cinnamon toast ice cream sandwiches. Something so simple like snickerdoodles with ice cream between them is somehow so amazing.
__label__4	Always responded timely  to our concerns and solved the problem with bugs. Thank you so much OUR GREEN TEAM. Continue with great Pest control job.
__label__4	We 4 have been there 3 times in three days. The dinner was better than the lunch because the portion is bigger and spicier. More spicy cuisine is better than plain one.
__label__4	More expensive than other places and they gave me pate when I told them to not put it on. But overall the banh mi is good when you need a quick bite.
__label__4	The food and service was so delish! The server forgot two items and fixed it in under 5 mins! Service was fast and the food was so good!!
__label__4	I love Kat! I went to her for a sleeker cut and color. She has delivered each time and is great at blow drying to boot, even teaching me some tips.
__label__4	the best fish tacos and shrimp flautas!! the black chili sauce is so good.  the only downside is that there's no chips and salsa, and you have to lay for it,and it's a tiny tiny amount . but it's worth it for the tacos. the beef tacos are also really good.
__label__4	"Great food. Cute spot. Reasonably priced. Friendly staff. What more could you want??

The only thing that kept this from 5 stars was that I put in a to go order, stood 5 feet from the kitchen, saw the food come up, watched a server pack it (he knew it was mine), and he then let it sit for 10 minutes before I asked a different server if it was mine. 

Not fun eating a cold burger..."
__label__4	"When I think Metairie I think of strip malls and chain restaurants...I always forget that Old Metairie is actually a nice little place.

This is a cool, dark, laid-back place.  I was warned that the drinks were kinda expensive, but they really aren't by New Orleans standards ($4 for a well...I call that pretty damn reasonable.)

They also have food...but I didn't get any other than the complimentary bar snacks.

I had fun hanging out with the staff (on duty and off) and the regulars..."
__label__4	Good hamburger and I love their fries. One of the best choice for fast food hamburger, so much better than McDonald's! The fries are soft and a still a little crunchy, yummy!
__label__4	Food is great!  Mango salsa is really fresh and flavorful.  Grande Royal taco or whatever it's called is really tasty.  Definitely try the chopped salad if you are looking for something lighter.  I have enjoyed all of the drinks I have tried thus far.
__label__4	Good Latin music on top floor, good hip hop music downstairs. However, in the 45 min that we checked on the bottom floor it went from a group of 5 people to no people on the dance floor, super bummed about that. There's a decent amount of good dancers upstairs, and the crowd got bigger as the night progressed so definitely go there if you want to dance Latin music. Decent cover at $10 which is more economical than the $20 clubs back in Boston.
__label__4	"Love it! Toni has done my hair twice now and I absolutely love it. She listened to what I wanted and asked the all important question what do I do for a living and what does my hair need to do. I'm a teacher at a daycare and need to pull my hair back an she always makes sure it works for my job and still looks amazing.
One downer is there are a bit pricey if you want color done."
__label__4	"I've been wanting to try this place.  I recently bought a coupon book, so I took advantage of a discount.  

First impression was that it was very clean.  All employees were at the ready and pleasant.  Very helpful.  Food was fresh.  Many meat options.  I chose a steak taco.  It was delicious.  My friend got a sale.  It looked great and I will go that route next time.  

Nice experience.  I will be back."
__label__4	I found Exceptional Electric through Home Advisor and immediately received a phone call from the company who set the appointment.  I hade an electric door bell and a ceiling fan replaced.  Both were completed without any problems or issues.  Good Job!
__label__4	I used their online app the other day for their BOGO salad. I was a little disappointed that I could not add red onions to my salad. Glad I had a red onion at home. I also ordered some hot wings that were really delicious....
__label__4	Tonight the place is packed for Meat Bingo. We've experienced both friendly people and regulars that aren't thrilled with all the new people that are here tonight. TJ's pizza and Urban Chestnut had me covered. Would love to come back and see what a normal night looks like sometime, but we are already planning to be here for the wine and pizza pairing!!!!
__label__4	"Fabulous food.  Courteous, friendly attentive waitstaff.  Glad to read that we weren't the only ones dismayed at some parent's unwillingness to discipline their offspring. I love kids but, come on guys, this isn't Chuck E. Cheese! We will be back but maybe on a weeknight and after kids' bedtimes.  If they even have bedtimes, that is. 

This side of town is sorely in need of high quality, independent restaurants with 'real' food.  Wild Hare more than meets that need."
__label__4	TURKEY RIBS. ARE YOU SERIOUS.. Yep HE IS FRICKING SERIOUS.  The turkey ribs are awesome, yeah it us not technically ribs but the cut and presentation sure make them look like ribs.  They are moist and tender, an absolute must try if you stop in at Gobble Stop!!!
__label__4	"So since our initial mishap, we've been back several times now, even for takeout. Wings are really good, chicken parm dinners and sandwiches are good too. Pizza is very good too.
Sometimes service is slow, but usually attentive."
__label__4	Brunch is my favorite meal and mimosas are my favorite morning beverage!! These guys did an excellent job despite being absolutely slammed. We waited about 45 min even after calling ahead for a table and being put on a wait list, they DO NOT take reservations unfortunately. They do offer complimentary coffee while you wait though so that's a bonus. Food was tasty, drinks yummy, service was really really good!!
__label__4	I was originally iffy about eating there due to the outdated appearance, but with the 4.5 star rating, I decided to give it a try! I ordered the gumbo! It was absolutely amazing! My boyfriend had the jambalaya with sour cream, cheese, and red onions atop! We topped them of with the garlic powder! Both meals were amaze-balls!! We finished with a peanut butter pie and toffee cookie which were tasty as well! A must try!
__label__4	"This place isn't in a great part of the city but boy is the food worth it. I had the mangu bowl and it was enough food to last me 2.5 meals. The chicken is juicy and falls right off the bone. When you pair their amazing meat with the mangu it's like a piece of heaven. You will be full eating this meal--theirs no doubt about that. 

It may be a bit hard to order if you don't speak Spanish but they have all the food right in the front, so for the most part you can just point to things you want."
__label__4	Stopped here for lunch today. They have outdoor seating, and indoor as well. They have a lunch menu, we ordered from that. I had a chicken chimichanga, with lettuce, rice, and refried beans on the side. Melted cheese on top of the chimi. It was all good. Daughter had a full order of beef nachos, beef, refried beans and melted cheese over taco chips. And, of course, they brought out chips and salsa at the beginning. She liked the nachos. I had sweet tea to drink, it was pretty good.
__label__4	"Unbelievable, fantastic BBQ. 

Great beer selection, convenient location!"
__label__4	"The Bower is great! Whether you want to dance, sit on big comfy couches and chill with friends or stand by the bar and talk with strangers.. you'll love it. I've always had a soft spot for basement bars and this one takes the cake in Edmonton so far. The ambiance and decor is on point! Taxidermy, old mirrors and chandeliers, an array of old furniture.. it's all great. 

I'd recommend going when the Night Vision dj/producer crew are spinning. You will not be disappointed!"
__label__4	I've taken my pooch here more times than I can count. If she just needs her nails trimmed or the grooming works PetSmart grooming always delivers.  The do take walk-ins for the nail trimming, but if you need anything else done for your furry friend, you'd be better off with an appointment. The store is clean and well lit and the people that work there are friendly too. They have tons of options for treats for your pet.
__label__4	Good food and service but Soda refills aren't free and they charge $3+ for soda in small glass. They could at least have 32 ounce cups. So beware if you take kids.
__label__4	"I've eaten here a half dozen times in the last month.

The cheesy potato option is well worth the upgrade. They are delicious and gooey. If you show them the smartphone app you can get the upgrade for free!

The omelets are simply amazing. The meals are generous. 

The waitresses are friendly and jovial.

Sadly, I have to knock off a star. The out door seating area is closed from fall until spring. Despite the awesome weather we are experiencing I can't enjoy my meal outside."
__label__4	Stopped in at the Court Diner while out in the burbs and was very pleased with the experience.  The server was fast and attentive.  I enjoyed the decor.  I ordered a reuben sandwich with no bread and it was very tasty.  My only complaint is that I wish they had some more gluten free options.  Otherwise I really enjoyed my stop at this diner.
__label__4	Great tacos. Limited selection but what they have is very good. I had the Carnitas & Fried Chicken. Loved the carnitas, a lot of meat. Only 2 pieces of chicken on the fried chicken, not my favorite. Husband got the Memphis BBQ with slaw. The rice/refried bean combo, a layer of rice on top of refried beans. We shared the cheese dip.
__label__4	The Sidecar is a great little place. Service is more than friendly, without being in your face throughout the meal. Hip south Philly crowd, and a great draft list. Sampled off the menu for dinner, and the food was great bar food. I have heard that this place is amazing for brunch, can't wait to get back and give it a go.
__label__4	Good, reasonably priced, hearty food. Definitely worth checking out if you know nothing about Ethiopian food.
__label__4	On a nice weekend getaway we decided to try this place out.  First of all they have free valet parking.  So far so good.  We were seated quickly in a low lit dining area and promptly introduced to our waiter and wine list.  The decor is up scale as is the dining.  We had a fried calamari appetizer which was good.  I had the seafood linguine and she had a chicken dish.  We both liked our food and had a nice time to boot.  Made for a romantic night and fond memories and that is about as much as you can ask for.  Almost a 5.
__label__4	Very nice neighborhood bar, open late and the $5 Pimm's Cup is delicious.
__label__4	Best pizza in Tucson and my wife loved the muscles. Nice outdoor area and the service is good too.
__label__4	Love the balcony.  This is on the quiet end of Bourbon- you can see the crazy part of the strip in the distance, but this end is lively but not crazy. They project videos of the music they're playing on the wall across the street above the Clover Grill.  I like that kind of thing.  Friendly bartenders, decent prices for Bourbon St, and the you can look right down into the windows of the Clover Grill.  Watched a couple of big bearded dudes have an arm wrestle, bicep flex, then a thumb war.  In  that order.
__label__4	My daughter who is 6 years old decided to cut her long hair up to her chin!  Meg completed the task, momma handled it.  She did great with my daughter, explained everything in great detail. Very nice shop, clean & friendly.  Easy to make an appt online, just need to set up an acct (quick & easy also). Would love to return for myself but leaving the town before an appt works out. Would highly recommend!
__label__4	"This place makes really good omelets. Quick service. @ a reasonable price. Cash Only though.

I got the Western Omelet and it was incredible. My boy got a BEC on a lightly toasted Kaiser. Said it was dope as well."
__label__4	We went there on Halloween and the place was packed. The servers were in costume and the ambiance was great. The food was amazing.
__label__4	Just went there for the first time and this place is amazing. Got the number #1 after previously ordering the pork. The owner said if this is your first time, you should try the #1 as it is the most popular. The ingredients were so fresh and the bread was amazing....super soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside. I am a fan and will be back.
__label__4	My mom loves Cuban sandwiches. I personally was not craving one. Seeing the bowls where you basically make your own meal was for me. I chose black bean burger with garlic tostones, green beans and cilantro lime rice. Yum! I tasted her yuca fries and fell in love. Oh & very good sangria!
__label__4	Yeah I know you're like why are you writing a review on a movie theater?! But this is a great theater that is clean and offers a lot of movie times. Just wish there was more parking near by. I've been comin here for a while whenever Im back in the Tucson.
__label__4	We went for a work day lunch and used open table for our reservation. The food was very good - I had a delicious tomato soup and my husband got a salad. The service was really fantastic - friendly without being intrusive and incredibly attentive. They made sure we were back to work within an hour, which is pretty rare with fine dining.
__label__4	Have come here for wine, cocktails, and eats a few times. Great vibe, good service. Outdoor seating and open air in the summer is a great bonus.
__label__4	The good news is that there is a new management team on board, and based on my recent interaction involving a contract situation, I'd say things are looking up at Sol y Luna.  Lynn and Rock went overboard to resolve the issue to my daughter's and my satisfaction.  Keeping positive that the new team will turn things around - I certainly appreciate how they assisted my family!
__label__4	So I haven't had much ramen, especially not in New Orleans. But in general, I really enjoyed it. The food was filling, which is always a plus for me. I ordered a meal with ramen noodles as opposed to the options of udon and rice, and the dish had brisket, mushrooms, and onions. It was pretty satisfying, although it wasn't as flavor filled as I hoped it would be. Also, it was a bit overpriced than what it was worth. But overall, it was a good time, and I'm definitely looking forward to going again.
__label__4	"The review is for the mango sticky rice. I follow this restaurant on Instagram. As soon as I saw its post about this dessert, I immediately ordered online for delivery. 

Food came on time. Delivery person was very friendly and wearing a mask.

The mango still has the skin intact so that it's a little bit hard to eat. The sticky rice was still warm and moist. It comes with ground peanuts and coconut cream which brings crunchy texture and an awesome combination of sweet and salty. Definitely get this"
__label__4	Burger was fantastic.  Sweet potatoes fries were tasty and the place seemed to be clean and well run.  Beats shake shack by a mile.  The milkshake was ok, seemed more like a MCD than a real shake
__label__4	Place is a solid place to visit once a month or so. Food is either amazing or mediocre. I particularly like the smoked breaded Gouda- it's basically the best cheese stick in existence. It is a bit pricey for what it is, and they don't split checks which is irritating. Seriously, how hard is that to do?  Still a good spot just a little too douchey to go more than once every other week or so.
__label__4	"We ordered delivery for our hotel as we were too tired to venture out. We had jalapeño cheesy bread and turtle cheesecake (yes, we are very healthy eaters) lol
The jalapeño cheesy bread was so delicious and still super hot when they delivered it! The cheesecake was really good as well, but can't say I have ever had a cheesecake I didn't like. 
We didn't not try eating in restaurant this week, but if you want to try the delivery service, we highly recommend it."
__label__4	"Stumbled on this place while driving back home from South Jersey and typing in ""diners"" into the Waze app. Place is pretty big and looks more like a bar than the typical jersey diners. There seemed to be quite a few people waiting to be seated so I was afraid it would be a long wait but everyone was seated very quickly. I ordered my usual diner order: Greek omelette with bacon. Food came fast and tasted just fine. Coffee wasn't bad either. Waitress was pleasant (didn't catch her name)."
__label__4	I have always had great customer service at the restaurant. A few weeks ago a friend and I had a waitress Aida serve us.  She was great to go out of her way for a few special requests on an order we placed. Thank you Aida!
__label__4	Such a beautiful and chic hotel. very very trendy. Great area, the trolley is on the same street and takes you about 10 mins to get to the french quarter. you can walk to the convention center. there are tons of restaurants on the same street.
__label__4	haven't been here in years! but when i lived in the area it was great!! great place to go to drive some balls, or just grab a cone.. now that i have a son i can't wait to take him here to play mini golf and have a cone aftwards. i hope this place stays around forever!
__label__4	Great store with a good selection of outdoor equipment.  The employees where all very helpful, friendly and knowledgeable.
__label__4	My wife and I really enjoyed this bar!! It's on the rooftop of the Hilton at the Ballpark. We were staying at the hotel so it made sense to try it our first night in St. Louis. We went on a night the Cardinals weren't playing so it wasn't super crowded. The best part about this bar is the view. It's a 360 view of the city!! The view alone is worth the trip to the 26th floor. We enjoyed the night and our beverages and we highly recommend it.
__label__4	Very good but please offer vegetarian soup options! The last few times I was there, you only offered chicken tortilla and chicken noodle soup. I love bagels with soup but I'm getting ready to give up and find a new place.
__label__4	We came for wine down Wednesday which was such an awesome event. You got three practically full sized wine glasses and a plate of cheese. The cheese plate was a lot, I could have split it with another person but we had leftovers which was fun. I would add meat next time I came to even out eating that much cheese
__label__4	"This place has several gluten-free and vegan dessert options!

toffee nut cookie = 3.5 stars

Service = 5 stars"
__label__4	"Awesome place for a haircut. It's well hidden but sometimes those are the best places. It's off of 50 next to the Hardee's. 

The barbers all know how to give great cuts including beard trimming and shaving. You will look great, this place knows how to make you look clean. You just have to make an appointment before you show up. You have to use an app to make the appointment but it's not hard."
__label__4	Hella impressed with their delivery speed. I was staying in a hotel near the airport and was too lazy to go out. I didn't think they'd deliver but they did! It only took 40 minutes from when I ordered to when they knocked on my hotel room door. The food it decent, fresh ingredients. I'd highly recommend ordering from here if you don't want to leave the hotel!
__label__4	"Surprisingly good. Stopped here on the way through Reno for a large and filling vegan meal. Ordered a rice bowl, which was very large and tasty, and bought a pumpkin chocolate chip cookie to eat on the road. The only negative was their iced tea; $2.75 for a glass of weak yellow water. 

Will definitely stop here again the next time I am trudging through Nevada."
__label__4	"Good sushi, fast service!  

We came here at 9pm on a Saturday and ordered soup and salad, and a bunch of sushi. The appetizers came in 5 minutes and the massive plate of sushi came 10 minutes and 33 seconds later. Everything was delicious!"
__label__4	Dinner with a large party on a Saturday night as part of a kid free weekend getaway. We were seated promptly at our reservation time and service was excellent. My hubby and I shared the southern fried chicken with the white cheddar mac and cheese and subbed the greens for mashed potatoes (who's counting calories...plus we were sharing). Everything was very good but the white cheddar mac and cheese stole the show!
__label__4	Can't speak for the other items on the menu, but I love their Cubano sandwich.  It's fantastic.  And the older lady working there is a kick - she's a firecracker!
__label__4	"The people, especially our waitress was really nice and knowledgeable.  I had the steak and a salad and a baked potato. The salad was good. The potato wasn't completely done and it wasn't warm.
The steak wasn't bad but I've had better, even at other O'Charley's. 
Santa stopped in and he was a good one! My 1 year old grandson sat on his knee for a picture!"
__label__4	Love this place! I never get to eat authentic Korean food anymore and I'm glad I've found this place. The beef bugolgi is my absolute favorite. It tastes amazing. The place itself is also super clean and nicely decorated.
__label__4	"Beautiful restaurant in a historic building with very good food and wine list and terrific service.

Our group shared the goat cheese croutons, the eggplant caviar and the gnocchi appetizers, all very good. So we're the Bayona salad and the roasted beet salad.

The salmon and pork chop entrees were very good; the roasted duck however was a bit chewy.

All in all a great dinner."
__label__4	It's reliably good food and a very relaxed atmosphere. The sweet potato fries are delicious, and I always go for a roast beef po boy. Nom nom.
__label__4	"2 blocks across the street from conference center, great food

We were a petty of two and got 4 dishes to share: oysters, alligator, pork cheeks, and mac and cheese--all delicious and the four dishes combined were the perfect amount of food for two.

Get the alligator. That was our favorite.

The oysters have an oily spicy sauce here and they went really well for adding some flavor to the Mac and cheese.

For nonalcoholic drinkers, they have a rose elderflower lemonade (in a bottle)!"
__label__4	"Solid steakhouse. The meat tasted of high quality. I had the filet which was seasoned perfectly and very tender. Our server, Rachel, was excellent. She checked in a lot (but not too much) even though she was also in charge of the whole bar. 

I wish they had more vegetable offerings (maybe a kale or Brussels sprouts side) but I'm spoiled by California produce. 

New Zealand Pinot noir isn't very interesting, but I should have known that."
__label__4	Went here for a business lunch. Me and clients had the 12$ special with a choice of soup or salad, a small appetizer and a main course of your choice. You can pick from a vegetarian, meat or seafood add-on. Dishes were small courses but added to a whole meal. All tasty and fresh. If you come in the evening or weekends this is BYOB.
__label__4	"I heard great things about this Giuseppe & Sons and went to check out the luncheonette. It was SUCH fast service I was amazed. I had the chicken parm sandwich and my friend had the italian which he said was really good. The chicken parm sandwich was the perfect portion - not as big as the italian but the chicken took up the whole bun and the sauce and cheese were perfect. 

My only complaint would be I wish something came with the sandwiches - a bag of chips or a small side salad or something. 

I can't wait to check it out for dinner."
__label__4	I have at Conners twice and found the food excellent and the service very good. Not as expensive as I first thought. I recommend it for lunch and dinner.
__label__4	You can't beat the hibachi happy hour deal here, plus it's BYOB. Service is quick and the chefs are great and really know how to entertain. Make a reservation if you plan on coming for happy hour, though why would you go any other time and miss out on the deals. They also have sushi which was very good and there's a huge selection. They have sit down dinner, but my friends and I were too excited for the hibachi deal. Definitely a must for a girls night out or date night.
__label__4	Great food and service. Like every Indian restaurant in America, all the chicken entrees are boneless so the karhai wasn't the same as an authentic karhai but had great flavour. The serving size was quite big and could be easily shared. The joint was extremely loud and we could barely hear each other but not something that could be avoided.
__label__4	"I've been coming here for a few months now to get my nails and toes done. The place is nice and peaceful. Since it's not as big as some of the other nail shops, there isn't a lot of people running around which is nice.

Multiple people have done my nails and they always come out nice. Vick is by far my favorite nail tech for my acrylics. She is amazing and has pleasant conversations. Her work is basically flawless and will be the main reason I continue coming to this nail spa."
__label__4	It's good, a little fishy, but some people like that. The breakfast was great and the service was okay. I'd recommend it
__label__4	Great Breakfast place with reasonable prices. Overall good quality. Prompt and polite service- a place we will return to!
__label__4	"Called them to ask for some help short notice.
They were able to respond quickly, set up a time within a couple days.
great movers.  worked hard.  Nothing was damaged or bumped.
moved 2 houses into one in less than 4 hours!
I was very impressed.
I am recommending to all my friends who are moving and will use them again when I move.

Very helpful.  Great price.  Nice guys."
__label__4	I really like this place because they have vegan menu! I think they may be the only breakfast place in town that does. Their potatoes are also quite yummy!
__label__4	Fantastic, quaint, and welcoming!  Most things can be made vegetarian, which means many options to choose from.  I especially enjoyed the banana chocolate spring rolls.
__label__4	I love Ike's for a great cup of coffee while walking through downtown. Not only is Ike's blend spectacular, but their sandwiches and salads are some of the best around! Make sure you check out the board for some interested coffee concoctions! Gave Ike's a 4 only because there is never any seating when I'm interested in staying. Other than that it's a 5. And I've heard Ike's a pretty nice guy too! ;-)
__label__4	"Fried chicken paradise in the Treme. This place smells like home-cooked fried chicken before you even open the door and it just gets more heavenly when you walk inside. Briny, meaty, crispy and all of the qualities you look for in a good piece of fried chicken. 
Like many of NOLA's best restaurants, the interior is nothing special and the exterior is unassuming, but don't be put off. Yummy delicousness awaits."
__label__4	Good seafood at an reasonable price.  Excellent service.  Accommodates large groups well.
__label__4	The problem with Philly cheesesteaks from Philadelphia is......they blow away all other cheesesteaks EVERYWHERE else.  If you're from Philly.......I guess that's not your problem.  I thought you could get the best of anything in N.Y.  I guess I'm wrong.  I can honestly say that I'm not sure that Tony Lukes is the absolute best........but it's pretty damn close........and it's definitely one of my favorites.
__label__4	My husband and I love going here. It's our favorite restaurant for authentic Mexican. Some of our favorites include the steak fajitas, Fat Alex burrito and steak tacos. Their plantains are delicious as well. They typically have different drink specials each night. I really enjoy the atmosphere. It can get crowded so the best time to go is for a late lunch/early dinner. You get a ton of food for your money. Staff is always pleasant and accommodating. Great place to go if you're really hungry and craving some yummy Mexican food.
__label__4	Took longer than expected.. but they did it without an appointment and months later... no issues.  Happy with their service and decent price.
__label__4	Plenty of choice of beers, cider and cocktails. Pizzas look great however I wanted something light and they offered a cheese board selection with meats. 7 different cheeses to select.  Industrial looking furnishings, good atmosphere. A few tv screens on the walls. Nice long bar with tv above.
__label__4	Had a late night girls night at this place. The food is great. The service is nice. The environment is cute. Our appetizers are amazing!
__label__4	"We ordered some food to go from here. 
The food was really good and we ordered some frozen margaritas for dinner. 

We had to wait a little bit to pick up the food, but we didn't mind too much as they were clearly packed. 

I would suggest just ordering frozen drinks from somewhere else as it was a tad pricey here."
__label__4	Tasty and affordable. The pakora appetizer was amazing. The baingan bhartha and paneer jal ffrezi were great.
__label__4	"3.5 stars really- breakfast is better than their lunch / dinner.  Lunch  / dinner food is mediocre , bland , and could use some seasoning .   Our table had a burger , fried chicken, blt, and a country steak and nothing stood out. Burger was dry and unseasoned. 

Portions were good. Clam chowder soup was decent."
__label__4	"Had the WEST COAST SPECIAL and the DOUBLE MESA. I preferred the West Coast Special, it was a great mix of flavors. The Double Mesa was an okay, ""safe"", type of taco... and I feel like West Coast Special was more of a jump. I'll be back to try other tacos, but will definitely re-order the WCS."
__label__4	Good pizza, service efficient, still moving on to discover more. Sauce a little tomato pastey for me.
__label__4	"A great place for a fantastically instagramable dessert. The blackberry buttermilk ice cream is really good. The mint chocolate ice cream uses real mint leaves and is not bright green full of dye. The chicken tenders were so so, but the burger was good. The BLT was ridiculously filled with bacon it made all of our mouths water. 

All of the freak shakes are out of this world. The one with cotton candy was my favorite."
__label__4	"Food is great.. However I thought it would be authentic Mexican but definitely it's Tex mex.. Still not to much complaints

Price wise it is a little more expensive than regular Mexican shops but won't break your bank 

They have a great bar and a very outstanding staff who makes you feel welcomed"
__label__4	"Came for the craft beer and Vault did not disappoint. Ordered a sample flight, which gives you 4 to try, but I added on 1 more for kicks. The beers were definitely tasty and paired nicely with the overall atmosphere. Rarely did you see people on their phones; instead people were enjoying each other's company and actually conversing! Although I did not eat, the food looked pretty delicious as I sat close enough to watch the chefs make it. 

It would be nice if they could add more brew tour time slots, but that would not keep me away from coming back for more."
__label__4	"A good place to grab a morning bite. They have all kinds of bagels. Garlic bagels and Egg bagels are my favorite. Toasted with some butter. 

Caplan Bagels isn't limited to simply bagels. Their breakfast sandwiches are delicious but a little on the pricey side. They were recently vandalized and closed for a bit. I'm excited to try them after they reopen."
__label__4	"A bank is a bank is a bank.

Nothing special, just like that it has 2 walk up ATM machines and 1 drive thru one.  Have never seen the inside of this bank.  These days, who needs to?"
__label__4	I have been to a few of the Peg's in town, this one stands out because of the warmth of the environment and the friendliness of the staff. It feels very small town homey. The other Peg's are high quality, huge portions and good service, but this one stands out, for me today, as a port in the storm. Prices are decent, you can expect. to pay $10-$15 for a breakfast. They have pancakes and waffles (and combos). They also have Hawaiian combos and Mexican combos.
__label__4	My review is only based on the beer. They have quite a selection of beers on tap. I have tried quite a few and they have all been really good. They also have deals on beer at happy hours.
__label__4	Stopped by Wilko yesterday just before the Guy and Dolls show for some wine and dinner. Worked out great since it's just across the street from centinenal hall and the 30% off wine bottles HH deal was pretty sweet. We also got the muricia pizza + the pappardelle pasta dish. The waiter originally messed up the order but quickly correct he mistake and had kitchen rush the order. Small hiccup but I liked the way our waiter responded in the event.  Overall good vibe wine bar next to campus
__label__4	Stopped by to have a local beer and a small plate.  The local beer choices were amazing, the bar staff knowledgeable and the pretzel sticks and accompanying sauce were very tasty.
__label__4	This is great brewer/restaurant in a beautiful part of Philadelphia. Staff is attentive and friendly and the beer is tasty. I loved the Jaegerschnitzel and the only suggestion is for fish entrees to be large. My wife's salmon entree was incredibly small. I definitely recommend this great place.
__label__4	"They do a good job here. 
Car Runs through the wash and then they do the detailing on the back end. 
Multiple options/levels. 
Good quick clean."
__label__4	I randomly chose this salon from reading through the Yelp reviews. I called expecting I'd get an appointment within the next week or so, but NO! They fit me in that day!! I walked in and was overjoyed to find they use Aveda products. Ashley, my stylist, was fabulous. So sweet and bubbly! I received the best hair cut I've had in a long time. I definitely recommend this salon!!
__label__4	Had dinner here last night with my daughter and husband.  My meal (eggplant rollitini) was delicious.  It came with 2 veggies (the peas & carrots weren't great), and I had enough left over for another meal.  We also had chicken marsala and a veggie wrap, which were both very good.  I like having another reasonably priced place to eat in Collingswood.  The location is great, and the service was very warm and friendly.  We'll definitely go back there.
__label__4	The employee that was taking my order was so patient with me even tho we had a hard time hearing each other on the phone. After all of that i went to go pick up my order and they said the delivery guy took my pizzas on accident. So they ended up giving me two free two liters and for the inconvenience. Overall loved how patient he was and how generous he was!
__label__4	This place was Amazing! If you Love Hot Cakes PanCakes then this is the place for you! Great Service Great Food and a Great Time! Well Recommended!
__label__4	Good food for the price. Got the ultimate feast and it is about as good as it gets. Rather than it being fresh
__label__4	Well got to try this place today must say very large portions easy to locate a little crowded but they moved quick on getting seating food was good
__label__4	"We had breakfast and lunch. They actually cooked my eggs ""over easy"". Thank you! Lunch was the blackened chicken po' boy which was excellent.

The music was way too loud.

Visited January 2013"
__label__4	Love chick fil a, always great service and great food. Always clean. Mobile app makes ordering to go super easy and fast. Good iced coffee!
__label__4	I met a fellow Yelper for lunch today. We both got the ribeye special with baked potato and salad. Travis redeemed his free check in dessert but I didn't realize I had one, save it for my next visit. The food was good as usual, service was kind of slow but I think out server had the entire side of the restaurant so understandable.
__label__4	Although it is a modern interior, the sushi/sashimi are traditionally prepared and some of the best in the area . I also enjoyed the table side tofu and the sake/beer selection.
__label__4	"Really yummy hotdogs here! They're all different but delicious. I had ""the Michigan"" which is chilli, onion, cheese and mustard and it was amazing. The fries are great and they have different sauces. I had the ""serracha"" the lady said itd be spicy, but it was wasn't and was still good. My friend had ""pero caliente"" with chipotle mayo and she enjoyed it as well."
__label__4	"Great experience at this place. Sat on a lopsided balcony, but felt safe and had great views of the French Quarter.

Checked in on Yelp App and received free appetizer. Got the stuffed mushrooms. Nice treat."
__label__4	On a lazy December afternoon I ordered the green chicken curry to-go through Doorstep Delivery. The curry nicely spiced, veggies fresh, and chicken good enough. The portion size for the price was about right-commensurate with quality in my opinion. Love having a place like this just around the corner from our condo on Mass Ave. I look forward to going to the bar and checking out the jazz.
__label__4	Called for a 4am pickup to the airport from the Fairmount Park area. Taxi came on time, dispatcher called to let me know taxi was outside, and got to the airport in less than 30 minutes. Driver also accepted credit card although not all that happily. I got where I needed to go so no complaints for me.
__label__4	Went there for first time today. I tried their chicken teriyaki appetizer. I thought it was really good. I wasn't a big fan of the lo mein because they use the big lo mein noodles but other than that it was good.
__label__4	"Solid, affordable breakfast spot.

Had the Greek omelet and homefries.  Eggs were thoroughly cooked, gyro meat was tasty and the taters were hot & crunchy.

Staff was uber-friendly, order came out of the kitchen quickly and the bathroom was spotless.

Not much else to add until I go back."
__label__4	"The General Tso chicken was one of the best I've had. It was a generous portion of chicken, rice, and broccoli. The shrimp roll was good, not great. The won ton soup was very tasty. All that for $9.
The wait staff was very attentive and the ambience was nice."
__label__4	"That Chicken Sandwich...totally lives up to the hype. Sooo good.

The Chicken wings...tasty, but also a little pricey for what they are (which is why I knocked off a star).

The donuts...got them for my family. Was told they were delicious...dangerous.

Would definitely go back the next time I'm in Philly (wish they existed when I used to live there! Or maybe not since I would be there all the time!)"
__label__4	We went here for lunch. Lunch was delicious...felt like I had a home cooked meal! I'd definitely recommend to try this place. My first time here, but I'll be heading back!
__label__4	The tasting room is really beautiful here and only a short block away from the beach.  Plus, you can walk over to the skate park after your tasting and watch the crazy kids shred.  $10 for a tasting of about 5 wines, mostly reds.
__label__4	The food is fresh, consistent and always delicious! The building is older but they always keep it tidy and clean.
__label__4	Great drink specials and delicious menu for happy hour. Favorite dish of the evening was definitely the roasted Brussels sprouts... they were savory with a creamy sauce  the margarita was also made very well.
__label__4	"I love Jean's Cafe.  Good for breakfast or lunch, this place is always hopping.  Their breakfast sandwiches are a healthier and cheaper substitute to the grease cart's on nearby Broad Street.  For lunch they have a good selection of deli sandwiches and wraps.  

It's on the small side, but seating is available.  The service is great so its easy to get in and out."
__label__4	"My family and I call this our ""back yard restaurant""... because we could throw a rock into their parking lot (not that any of us have....) 
It's a gem. Their seafood dishes are always fresh (grilled or in pasta!) and their pizzas are awesome too! Fresh and tasty ingredients makes for a tasty meal! They also do take out."
__label__4	"Los sarapes is a wonderful spot to get authentic mexican food.  They never disappoint when it comes to their food.  Their guacamole is fantastic and I always find myself finding new things on their menu but I always have to start with their guacamole.

Only cons I can come up with would be that sometimes the service is a little slow however they are a small place with only a few servers so it's expected in my opinion.  Their portions are also a little lackluster for the prices."
__label__4	"I love this place.  Everytime I am in old city I visit.  The decor is super chill and farmer city.  You can sit outside and the street is not that busy.  

The food is great.  I have never had a bad meal and I have tried almost everything on the menu.  The drinks are great too.  Everything tastes so fresh.  

The wait staff is very nice and attentive.  Plus they laugh at my humor....big win."
__label__4	Don't sleep on this place, the dishes are yummy!! The owners are super nice and very helpful. I called to place take out without ever having been there. The lady on the phone patiently answered my questions about their menu and offerings and helped with my order. I got this duck dish with soy beans and scallions and it was savory and delicious. The stewed beef is very authentic and reminds me of the way my mom makes beef at home.
__label__4	What a wonderful place! So refreshing to have the chef (who is sweet as pie) come around and talk with each of the customers. We also had an amazingly nice and attentive waiter and most importantly the food was perfection! Please come and enjoy this wonderful restaurant with the whole family. Some standouts were the hummus, falafel, naan bread and an amazing to die for tomato dip that comes with hummus.
__label__4	Great gelato, good service, TONS of flavors (check out their website for their daily flavors list), but quite pricey for gelato.  Even LA and NYC charge less, so it's definitely a treat.
__label__4	Every time I am in Reno I will eat here with my family. We like their Thai salads with peanut sauce. Fried tofu really good too. Thai fried rice.
__label__4	We went here for dinner with my kids and the food was excellent. Amazing cream of mushroom soup, flat breads, pasta, and an awesome arugula salad too! The service was wonderful and the food arrived in a very timely manner. I would give it a 5 star review except there was no soap in the ladies room- however the staff was very responsive when I told them and refilled the dispenser immediately. If you're in the area I truly recommend this place!
__label__4	"What's NOT to like about Cuba Libre?  I've had their Pan Seared Salmon and Vaca Frita, tres leches cake and coffee. Love the atmosphere and energy of this place. I haven't been here in about 3 years, so I hope this place hasn't fallen off! 

 I don't DO Old City at night anymore, unless it's during the week. (A little SICK of the Old City scene on the weekend. Been there and did that for YEARS and now I'm past done with it! LOL)"
__label__4	Looking for a good Philly cheese steak pizza? Gino's is the place to go. The only downside is they make it with a lot of love when you eat in... Take out or delivery, egh, its like they were rushing. But it is still good... Can't deny that...
__label__4	Best fish and chips in town. I love this place!! Staffs are nice and friendly. This place got both quantity and quality!! Dont complain about their food being greasy i mean its fried food. I tried most of the food on the menu and theyre overall tasty and full of flavor!
__label__4	This was my first time at this airport and I was very impressed. It was beyond clean, the staff was friendly and helpful. Free internet, and charging stations for phones and electronics. I'm looking forward to stopping through here again.
__label__4	Great place for a beer and some old time stompin' music.
__label__4	Cute. Clean. A variety of options. Friendly staff its close t home so we will be back soon.
__label__4	Cute little restaurant in beautiful Carpinteria. Unfortunately, it took us forever to get seated and get our food. Once the food came out it was hot and delicious. I got the Worker Bee Benedict and my sister and her boyfriend got a BLT and pancakes, all yummy!
__label__4	Wearing plaid to not look pretentious, but let's be realistic here... its pretentious... that being said, the food is great and service is normally good. Friendly and knowledgeable bartenders and servers. A little loud, but fun!
__label__4	Stopped in and had an amazing meal in this intimate tavern! Very friendly and flexible with my kids who have quirks about trying food!
__label__4	Overall I would say that the black bear diner was a good place to eat, the service was a little bit slow but probably due to our large party.  Portions were good size and the atmosphere is overall friendly, I'll probably be back
__label__4	Love this spot.  The food portions are a tad small for the cost but the food is amazing and totally worth it!
__label__4	I haven't been to Greece yet, but this is what I'd imagine the food scene to be like.   I had their Greek salad, octopus, moussaka, lamb kababs, spanakopita, and saganaki.  I will order the octopus and lamb kababs every time I go here.  The other items tasted quite similar to any other Greek restaurant in the area.
__label__4	I tried my first scrapple here! Unless you're used to it... Don't do it. Lol this place is so cute. I love the octogenarians who work here at 3am. Their desserts are wonderful, they have a cute retro vibe, and there are a million seats!
__label__4	Closest thing to southwestern mex rather than Tex mex in Nashville. Pricing a bit high for my frequent visit but if you can get a seat outside it's worth it.
__label__4	Was recommended by our hotel concierge. Amazing ambiance and enjoyed a great dinner. The food really is amazing and is served tapas-style for sharing. The only reason for not giving five stars is that the potions were a bit smaller than expected. However, the gumbo and steamed pork bun were fantastic and don't forget to order the pork cracklins!
__label__4	Shared a Big Jud burger with my wife. I'm not generally a fan of big meat burgers, but the cook on this 1 lb. patty was pretty good. I was surprised at how good the bun was. It was soft and had a sweetness to it. The only gripe I have is they don't offer American cheese... that's just un-American.
__label__4	Finally had a chance to try this place out. It is definitely delicious. Hubby says it's just like what he had in So. Korea. Only downside was that they didn't have Kimbob.
__label__4	Very good pizza for the area. Their meals are tasty as well. Not a big fan of the garlic rolls, too much oil for my taste. Service is always great, very nice people.
__label__4	I love the juice here! Lots of great combos of fruits, veggies, power boosters, and blended coffee drinks. The only thing I really hate is that they still use styrofoam, which is terrible for environment. Get rid of it!
__label__4	"Respectable breakfast and not super crowded.  Good atmosphere. Waitress was friendly. I'll come again!

Still gonna keep the 4 stars. But went back for Dinner and  it was complete chaos.  John the waiter who was there for 2 whole weeks was fantastic but had no help at all from any other leadership.  When sh*t such as call outs or whatnot happens a manager needs to step in and clean a few tables or make sure every guest is being helped.  2 weeks in the business John can't do everything."
__label__4	Like Central Park in NYC. Greenery, waters, open spaces. Need a lot of time here. You can go on paddle boats. Museum of Arts by park entrance. The street car takes you here from the riverfront all the way up Canal st.
__label__4	I went here for breakfast on a busy Saturday morning with a companion.  The lot was nearly full and we expected to have to wait, but we were immediately seated.  Our server took our drink order quickly and took our food order.  The waitress, a young lady from Horsham, was super friendly and conversational without being intrusive.  I had a cheese omelette, cooked great with tons of cheese and a fresh fruit cup.  My companion said the scrapple was crisp and tasty.  My only feedback is that the servings were a little small.
__label__4	Panera Bread has good food. It always seems like there is something new on the menu, and the menu is very expansive. They are a bit pricey, but I can get over that for the quality of the food. The atmosphere is nice too. It reminds me of a coffee shop and a restaurant. It's great to sit on a laptop, browse the web, read some books, or enjoy your meal.
__label__4	These guys are pretty clever. A restaurant that specializes in fries and makes your burger the side dish. I like it! Too often are the fries the after thought. There are about 6 types of potatoes to choose from and numerous dipping sauces. The people who work there were friendly and the service was fast! I paired a bison burger with my okinawa fries and a cold beer from their tap. I wish there was a Boise Fry Company in Seattle!
__label__4	Great sports bar and they serve some decent food.  Probably more like 3.5 stars but I'll be generous because Randy and Lexi really do try to accommodate their customers and know how to make you feel welcome.  We had a tornado hit while we were at the bar so that made it a bit more exciting, but TVs were tuned into baseball, football, and hockey games all on.  Dinner was fish and chips and a little greasy but good enough.  I saw a plate of awesome looking Nachos too.  I'll get those if I'm ever here again and looking for snacks not necessarily dinner.
__label__4	I love the food here, the only draw back is the service is not as great. They need to improve the type of service that the guys in the front provide. But overall the food and environment is great. I recommend for the food, it's reasonable and very delicious... those Mexicans (haha I'm mexican too) chefs do a great job on giving us an authentic taste of Mexican food.
__label__4	Great rooftop bar where you can overlook broadway aka excellent for people watching. A bucket of six bud lights was $24! The only drawback is that you can't take glass bottles onto the patio and have to pour them into plastic cups. It's an awkward process that would be easier if they just served the beer in the plastic cups in the first place. Definitely recommend if you're on broadway and it's nice weather
__label__4	"I was introduced to this by my boyfriend. 

I'm pretty picky when it comes to Chinese food, but this place is great.  My faves are the steamed dumplings, crab rangoon and fried rice.  Food is ready fast and it's always good!"
__label__4	Considering I didn't eat mine fresh (I took it home), it was still really really good. To be honest, I'm an easy person to please when it comes to cheesesteaks but I like Jim's a lot.
__label__4	"This place is relaxed and laidback, breezy, Santa Barbara-esque! A good place to study/work or meet up with friends. They have a good number of couches. Enjoyed the friendly service and the space to do some work on my computer, as well as the folk-pop music in the background . 
Had a sandwich and latte. The latte was unimpressive. The sandwich was kind of pricey, but delicious, fresh, satisfying."
__label__4	Leonard helped us book the tour. He was super nice and professional. He answered all our questions and informed us with all the necessary details. The tour itself was fun, we saw 2 crocodiles , the tour guid was only ok. The one thing that made it difficult for us to really enjoy the tour, that it was so very cold. We didn't expect it and didn't dressed appropriately. Make sure to wear something warm when it's not sunny :-)
__label__4	We always took our dogs here and loved stoney Creek. Dr. Johnson was amazing, sad she left. Haven't been back in awhile and not sure it's the same as it was when Dr. Johnson was their.
__label__4	A friend recommended this restaurant to us.  We loved it. Loved the decor. Food was fantastic. Gnocchi was like pasta candy. Highly recommend the scallop appetizer.  Husband loved the raw menu. Wasn't excited by the drink menu but the wine menu was great. Can't wait to go back.
__label__4	"Really tasty food that does seem ""fresh"" and relatively healthy, ambiance is nice and it is reasonably priced. I usually get a small plate and add a1/2 soup or salad. Fills me up but don't feel stuffed."
__label__4	Will always order from Ekta... Probably the best Tikka Massala Sauce in city.  Prices are a little high but food is amazing!  Also love the Vindaloo Chicken (very hot n spicy). Very friendly staff!
__label__4	This is my usual breakfast spot. The Big Breakfast gets me through the day. Small freindly atmosphere, good food.
__label__4	Good relatively inexpensive food in a convenient place right off canal I usually stay at the JW Marriot and it's a 3 minute walk from my hotel the only issue I've had with them is service related when they are at peak times it can be lackadaisical I once sat in my seat and folks who came in way after me were being served while I'm still waiting to order
__label__4	"Was in the mood for a nice pub atmosphere feel, and I saw this place was close to me, came on a Friday night and oh my gosh, never seen such a busy but live place, was lucky to get a stool at the bar, was greeted by a really friendly guy, had some of their top beers along with a plate of wings, which all were really good, service was fast and everyone was having a great time. 
Had a nice musician where everyone and their literal grandma was busting a move.
Will definitely come back, it was a fun time."
__label__4	"This is a really enjoyable restaurant. The food is pretty good not spectacular, but the service is great the harbor view is terrific and the scene is very SB and ""happening"" - it's always crowded and full of energy.  Whether you're just sitting at the bar enjoying a drink looking out over the beautiful Santa Barbara Harbor were sitting down for a full meal you're guaranteed to have a good time at this popular restaurant."
__label__4	This place has a nice comfortable setting inside and they play mellow music.  First time I came here, I had drinks and enjoyed it. I came back for restaurant week and was not very impressed with their food considering the amount of competition the city offers. Although the lobster Mac and cheese and the empanadas were delicious. I would come here for drinks and small plates. Overall, it's a good place to relax and have a few cocktails and talk with a little music in the background.
__label__4	The food tastes pretty good but the portion sizes were a little disappointing in my opinion. Good sugar cane coke, good salsas, and the food is always made fresh.
__label__4	It's really a great burger place. Choosing  one is hard but the Mad Hatter is delicious plus you can have a beer with it.
__label__4	A pretty good deal for the ACYE;  Nice staff, convenient location,
__label__4	Great Peruvian cuisine! Good food, great service. Will be back again to try some more food. Tried the calamari appetizer, chicken fried rice, Laquoma ice cream and Purple corn drink. Wonderful experience! Cozy little cute restaurant.
__label__4	"This is our go to place.  The food is varied and consistently delicious.  Great place for just a small bite or full meal, whether it's breakfast, lunch or dinner.  Really enjoyed being served by their new bartender, Emily, who is very friendly and was attentive to our needs.

I only gave 4 stars because of the loud acid rock being played in the background. But what do I know,  I am old and prefer more calm music."
__label__4	Me and my lady had got home, and had a note on our door from Nv energy, saying the gas had been turned off and we had to set up a time for a technician to come out and turn it back on. James a service technician had come by for our neighbor who had called. He offered to take time to get us taken care of. Thanks James for handling the situation like a professional!
__label__4	The service is great just as most of the reviews have already stated. The food came out fast. The fish was good and so was the shrimp. The shrimp was a little salty. I would come back.
__label__4	"This restaurant is a great place to go to after a long week. They had live music and it was nice to sit by the water. The service wasn't that great, because it was busy but the food made up for it. I just ordered a Caesar salad with salmon and it was amazing. 

The parking lot was super packed and I think the parking lot should have more lights, it was dark looking for my car. 

The outside decor isn't amazing but when you enter it is much better."
__label__4	"So pleased to have places like this, willing to do they legwork of salvaging all the Victorian doors, fixtures and gingerbread. 

Prices are reasonable and if you tell them what you're looking for, they'll help you get it. If they can find it, they'll make it (or find you someone who will!)"
__label__4	Came here for the first time after having aa happy hour drink and snack around the corner. The space is quaint and nicely decorated. The bartender was friendly and efficient. The drinks are strong and inexpensive. Our bartender told as about the hh specials including buy 1 hotdog and get a 2 me free which is a great deal.  Since we were full we passed this time. Several other patrons at the bar got food and it looked and smelled delicious. Will definitely be back.
__label__4	I just brought my old Bike to Bob's where they tuned up almost as well as it was when I first bought it so that I could sell it and get my new bike which of course I got FROM BOB's they helped me picked out the bike that  fit my needs and even tho it it was a tad more than I wanted to spend hence the missing star I knew that I was in the right hands.
__label__4	fun place. good for breakfast, brunch or anytime if you like bacon!
__label__4	This is one of my new favorite spots. My boyfriend and I split the guacamole, soooo creamy and good. (The plantain chips were to die for). Next he got the oyster taco and street corn, which he loved although there's only one taco per order.. I got the chicken enchilada and rice, rice was okay but the rest was awesome! On top of that the decor and paining on the wall was stunning (pic)
__label__4	Do you live downtown and need any kind of plumbing doohickey? Come to this place. Don't drive 10 miles to a place that has a staff you cannot find. This place has people ready to help you solve your plumbing dilemma. I had an issue and solved it with one visit because the fellow that helped me took a moment to understand my problem and recommend the correct part for the fix. And the prices are right.
__label__4	Decor is fabulous. Cynthia, the waitress was friendly and sitting in the runway was cool. Food was delicious. We did breakfast..eggs were perfect, potatoes were to rave about. Definitely will return!!
__label__4	So far so good! Great staff, very friendly and professional. Super nice ladies who want to help.
__label__4	Fun pub spot for a casual evening, also great patio spot for brunch. Prices are reasonable, nice menu selection and good drink selection. Yes, the beer cheese dip is a must along with the baked brie. Portions are large so could probably share, service is good and overall a neighborhood gem. Dog friendly as well--outside that is.
__label__4	Rosatis is outstanding. Occasionally you may get a soggy pie when you get home, but it is seldom. Prices are decent, and the sandwiches are def good and big.
__label__4	I loved the tostadas! There is a lot to pack onto a shell but they were tasty! My friend ordered the chef's choice pasta which was some sort of a cheesy roasted cauliflower that was also very delicious. We also got take out one of the nights we were staying at the resort and got a Caesar salad to-go. It was big enough for 2 people to share and the chicken was perfect!
__label__4	Vietnamese coffee, pork bahn mi, & mini beignets...delicious. Sandwich served on Duong Phuong bread with fresh veggies. Would give five stars but the coffee is a bit pricey.  Still, love
__label__4	Visited this pizza restaurant on vacation in Tampa. Clean and nice on the inside and service was solid. Pizza size and price was not bad. The pizza overall wasn't that great (just tasted plain) ordered a pizza half pepperoni and half pineapple did not finish or eat all leftovers. My daughter has a allergy to wheat and the gluten-free pizza crust was actually best gluten-free she has had. Would not return when back in area.
__label__4	"The stars are for the happy hour drinks, atmosphere, cleanliness, and service.

The minus 1 star is due to the portion size of fries for what you pay and the overall cost of their burgers. They're pretty pricey.

I'd recommend just coming for the drinks at happy hour. But it is hard to resist a juicy burger while drinking!"
__label__4	Enjoyed our dinner tonight.  Nice atmosphere.  Friendly service and the food was delicious.  Only one other couple in the restaurant.   Would definitely come here again for pasta.  Fresh and very tasty.   Give this place a try!  It was great!
__label__4	Great pizza and was there on Friday.  Long line but enjoyed the food. Reason it doesn't get a five star is because while waiting outside would be nice to enjoy the great night. However it's a smokers paradise and no consideration for others.  Management needs to address this.
__label__4	Good local food at reasonable prices.  Bigger selection and cheaper than Robert's.  MUCH cleaner than Winn-Dixie
__label__4	"They have live music every Saturday night! 

It's a nice little venue inside the interior courtyard, where you can order drinks and food. You can even get access to the pool (very clean pool btw) and enjoy the music from there. 

It's reasonably priced food and drinks but they can improve the quality a little bit. 

I must also note that aside from the parking lot, the interior, lobby & and courtyard are stunning and beautiful. I was not expecting that when I walked in."
__label__4	I had take out from Chef Li today for the first time and was pleasantly surprised.  The food was fresh and the chicken was all white meat.  I would have given a 5 star but the General Tso's Chicken was heavily sauced.  I would probably order something different next time, but I will be returning.  Staff was very polite.
__label__4	Good tacos for a good price. The tiki bar in the back is a nice change of scenery from the normal bar
__label__4	Their lemon bars are really good! They have just the right amount of lemon and are flakey and delicious, their blueberry donuts are also really good and all donuts are just $0.50 after 5 pm!
__label__4	Cute little walk with benches and art. Pretty to look at if you want to go on a short walk somewhere.
__label__4	"Mandatory gratuity still applies , but added more stars for their weekday lunch specials. Just can't beat the $10 price tag and the food is pretty good. 
Service is efficient too, so I leave my standard 20%."
__label__4	Seating was limited when my sister and I went here, as 50 person party had reservations. Pierogies had wonderful flavor, but we ordered traditional boiled version and they were cold. My sister is diabetic and asked for sweetener for her tea, but was informed they did not offer that; they carried sugar, only.
__label__4	Good atmosphere, comfortable. Yuca fries were great! Definitely a place to try for a casual bite.
__label__4	4 rivers was my go to restaurant for spicy food but this is my new love lol I love this place :)
__label__4	This place sure takes it's cleaning seriously. We went in for a quick in and out and we had a huge Ford F350, but we made it. He said we were the biggest in that day! LOL. Even when you just get a basic wash like the 12 dollar one, they take their time. I would go back to this place if we were ever in the area again, we really needed a bath! I wanted to thank the staff for being so patient with us, we were a big job and we did tip!
__label__4	A wonderful an helpful place affordable nice Quality furniture......our family brought a 3piece living room set and a dining room set absolutely luv......
__label__4	I was introduced to this place by a friend in high school and have been coming back ever since. The food is tasty and bird cage chairs are fun(I took my sister here who lives in South Carolina and she LOVED the chairs food and the place in general.) Its a good place to take a crowd or to go on a date since they are a Tapas place.
__label__4	"The Walmart of bars: bright, big, well lit, great prices on weekdays. Servers don't seem to care because just like Walmart the masses are there for the prices. 
Since Covid they have a host when you walk in the door that decides where you sit. Even when not many people are there they seem to spend a shocking amount of time studying the map to see where to seat you. It is funny to watch especially when the leave their stand to ask for help."
__label__4	This place has some good sourdough bowls filled with your choice of fillings. I got Mediterranean style bowl with chicken. The kids working there are friendly and attentive. Good experience..
__label__4	We decided to try Hana Tokyo Hibachi lunch and it was delicious! My husband and I brought along our 15 month old daughter and the environment and staff were very friendly and accommodating! The food was fresh and very tasty! Only reason I won't give a 5 star is because there were 2 dead Cockroaches in the restaurant. One by the Hibachi grill and one at the waiting area. We still gave them a try!
__label__4	"Tradition Irish pub atmosphere with some of the best service I have had recently. There is an ok beer selection with all the normal Irish staples like harp, magners, Smithwicks, Guinness.  The wings were delicious super crispy and the other food was decent with the exception of the house potatoes which were gross. 

Overall though it was a fun place to chill before a concert. It wasn't crowded on a Sunday night, but enough people for a decent atmosphere."
__label__4	I'm super picky about my sushi. Good job, best AYCE sushi I have had in Arizona to this point. Small menu but great quality made fresh rolls. Doesn't have all the bells and whistles on the AYCE menu in respect to hot foods and appetizers most places offer but makes up for it on quality on what they do offer.
__label__4	"Very clean, neat, and the coffee and food was good. I was in the area for a week long  event, and visited every day !

                                                            Jim Moore"
__label__4	Decent craft brewery tucked away in an industrial area. Inside is a big roomy warehouse with a variety of types of seating as well as board games. They have a couple tables outside but could definitely add more outdoor seating. Most of their pours are smaller  in volume. Guerrilla Street Food has a window counter inside with food available. Overall a nice place.
__label__4	"Yes! finally got a seat. It intimidating at first waiting for seat. But the service and food comes out so quick you don't have to wait any longer than 10 mins. Its a bit hard to find but just stay to the front of the market and you walk all the way to the corner. 

Apple DUMPLING!!! Dont forget to try it or take it to go for later if u are too full."
__label__4	Had the mesob tibs. Meat was cooked thoroughly with a touch of spice.    Also had the mashed chick peas with berbere sauce  which wasn't bad at all. I definitely recommend anyone give this restaurant a try. Different from American restaurants in that you eat with your hands and use the injera to pick up the food.
__label__4	Good food at a great value....Excellent way to experience the wide variety of sauces at the sauce bar.  Like the location and i'm sure it'll only get better.
__label__4	"Lush and green, this was a pleasant surprise.  Tucked in an industrial section of town by the river (there's a huge old power plant on one side), this was an unexpected delight.  

There's a nice breeze off the river, trees and greenery block a lot of the scuzzier nearby views and you can also see the Benjamin Franklin bridge not too far off.

Also close to that casino if you want to lose some money after enjoying nature.

The grass is really nice here.  I attended a beer festival and found myself hoping all the people wouldn't kill such a nice lawn."
__label__4	So my fiancé and I tried this place today and he and I have our own opinion of experience. He was disappointed of the food but for me, it was good. I ordered the spicy beef soup and really enjoyed the spices. The salt and pepper chicken was really good, had the same taste like anywhere you'd go. The owner was very friendly to us and the rest of the customers; he'd check up on you making sure you're ok and or if you needed anything else. I recommend for people to give this place a chance!
__label__4	Came by to start our wine tasting day. So far so good. Awesome service! Tried the platinum flight of wine and it didn't disappoint. We also did the free check in and got an additional pour.
__label__4	I was visiting a friend from out of town and we stopped at AJ's to grab some wine and cheese.  This place was my heaven.  Walls and walls of nice bottles of wine, a whole section devoted to gourmet cheese, a floral department and a dessert bakery.  I could have spent hours in there.  I felt like a child in a toy store.  I wish AJ's would expand to the East coast.
__label__4	From the outside, it doesn't look like much, but it has a lovely atmosphere inside, and the food is fabulous! Children could eat here, but it has a grown up-night-out feeling and fancier food. Tastes like home made out of your grandparents' kitchen.
__label__4	We save this place for special celebrations. It takes a bit longer than a typical Japanese or Chinese restaurant but they did not disappoint. Nice show, friendly and attentive staff. Early bird is a great deal. Go and be sure to take a chance on catching the shrimp without messing up your shirt!
__label__4	Pleasant little cafe located in a strip mall on the NW corner of Tanque Verde and Sabino Canyon.  Seating is both tables and booths plus an outside patio.  Large windows let in plenty of natural lighting.  Large craft beer menu with wine also available.  Open for brunch on the weekend.  Large menu ranging from sandwiches and salads to full entrees, but Mexican food seems to be their tour de force.
__label__4	Great Ruben, great Cuban, they are so good I haven't even tried anything else.  If it was a little bit cheaper it would be a 5 star.
__label__4	I remember the first time it open,hardly anything there.now,there are plenty of variety, must be under new management..I use to go to the one on Adams but now, I go here only its because it's closer to home.
__label__4	Build your own omelette was properly cooked and had fresh ingredients. Latte was tasty but I needed sugar and couldn't get her attention for about five minutes... too long. Service was a bit inattentive for not being busy but friendly enough and she was probably trying not to bother us on a lazy Saturday am.  Place was clean and neat.  I would definitely come back here.
__label__4	"Deano is awesome. 
When I arrived he was doing a coverup an a gentlemen to cover up an ex girlfriends name (why do people do that?!) and he did a quick and nice job. You couldn't even tell what it was prior. (Im sure his wife appreciated that)
He fit me in with very little wait and I was out in no time.
Reasonably priced, very personable, nice and clean.
I'll be going back for a cover up of my own (no not an ex boyfriends name lol)"
__label__4	"Eden offers outstanding, authentic Korean food. 

The service is excellent. The staff works hard to accommodate their patrons. 

I have ordered the kimchi pancake, the beef dolsot bowl, the Kalbi, the chicken bulgogi, and the tteokbokki. Each of them was prepared perfectly. 

The most authentic Korean food outside of Seoul. 

Go to Eden if you want to support a family-owned, quality Korean restaurant. Highly recommended."
__label__4	The beer is pretty good and their food is amazing. I usually come for the food and leave with a growler fill. So it goes. I'm a fan because they have vegetarian items on the menu which is always important for a weirdo like me. The service is usually pretty good but sometimes it can get crazy busy. That being said, it wouldn't stop me from coming back, I've been in and out of this establishment for years. Definitely one of the best places in Greenwood.
__label__4	I stopped at this location for about an hour while passing through Santa Barbara on a road trip. The service was super friendly and it seemed like the baristas knew many of the customers who came in. They were out of several food items but my coffee was good and made quickly. There was amble seating and the air conditioner was blasting. A standard Starbucks experience.
__label__4	Saw this pizza joint & had to try it. Well, it was delicious. Pizza was to die for & the thick crust was very yummy. They also have a good beer selection. They do have some good happy hour deals. I would definitely return to pizza joint.
__label__4	Okay here's an updated review. This place has really good food! I tried  House of Jollof again ( two days in a row) and was pleased with the flavor and excellent service.  This time I ordered a waakye wrap and goat soup. Well the goat soup was extremely spicy  so much so I couldn't take the heat. I would recommend the regular level of spice vs. spicy.  You almost don't need the extra spice since their food is already seasoned to perfection. My new favorite place.
__label__4	Great food and very friendly staff. The reubans are spot on. They know me so well. I don't even have to ask forcwhat i want. Great srvice.
__label__4	"We just celebrated my dad's birthday and I must say they treated us like royalty.  The staff especially Benny - the manager, was dedicated to making our experience a memorable one.  The food was delicious and plentiful.  The ""show"" from our chef was impressive and we will be back.  We were not happy initially with our seating arrangements since we made an advance reservation for the special occasion, but Benny treated us to a round of drinks and stayed close by for the entire dinner to make sure we were happy."
__label__4	Jack's is an excellent choice for those looking for a quick bite of local bbq.  Quick and tasty, it wil fill you up for the night.
__label__4	Be careful, they only give you large bowls to fill. They charge by weight, so you could end up with a $10 + bowl of froyo. I want my fruity pebbles! I was promised in one review that they had cereal toppings, none when I went three times. Love the yogurt! Love the toppings! Kid friendly too!
__label__4	Got my windshield replaced on Saturday afternoon at 4 PM I arrived at 4 PM for my appointment and they were finished a little after 5 PM. The prices were reasonable compared to the competition and the service was relatively quick and painless.
__label__4	"Was in the mood for ""Taco Tuesday""...
Although, it wasn't on sale or a ""special of the day""... It was filling and tasty!"
__label__4	Grilled Oceana oysters were delicious. Redfish dinner was even better! Dark inside, but outdoor patio is nice and bright.
__label__4	Really good food. Fair priced. The staff is always nice. They always ask if I want to leave a tip on my card which is awkward. If I say no will the food be not as good or if I do will it be better?  I'm sorry but I'm not going to leave a tip at a drive thru. So with that said, even without tipping, the food is great.
__label__4	"Somehow managed to avoid visiting here until today, despite living in Edmonton for decades.

Initial thoughts?

Best mac and cheese in Edmonton. 
And someone clearly knows how to choose beer - was happy to find Hophead IPAs on tap!
Service was fast, attentive, friendly. 

Will have to go a few more times to try the burger and poutine and few more items, but I could definitely see this being a go to place for the south side. Also a big fan of the food truck!"
__label__4	I'm from Chicago so this was a happy find near to my heart. Ive been missing Italian Beef for long time. So we went to give this place a try. Yum on the Italian Beef! The air conditioning was out and place was very hot inside due to outside temps. But we shall return for more Chicago Food for sure!!
__label__4	This place is the best food and beer combo option there is probably in all of Goleta and Santa Barbara. Their beer is good and the food is great, but that's it. At the end of the day, I wouldn't go here to go to a brewery, but instead eat, drink, and then go somewhere else to have that brewery feel.
__label__4	Great place to get eggs and bacon at anytime during the day. Customer service was great and the food was prepared in minutes. Love hitting this place while traveling on the road.
__label__4	"Let's keep this place open! Great food, reasonable prices, good service!

Little disappointed none of the associates were wearing masks...Not good!"
__label__4	I had the belly buster omelette. It was amazing! Huge portions and great taste. Staff was very friendly.
__label__4	Great beer specials. A smoking bar is a plus. I enjoy it here. Friendly and at tentative staff. Free Wi-Fi
__label__4	Very good pizza. Very accommodating. Lost a star on their drink prices. But then again I am a cheap a$$
__label__4	"I was at a housewarming party and asked the host where he got the pizza. ""Palermo's,"" he said.

He had ordered several pizzas and a couple of orders of wings. Palermo's doesn't deliver so he had to pick them up. The pies we ate were large, fresh-tasting and delicious. The mushroom vegetable pizza was a hit with the partygoers, and had a good sauce and ample toppings! The wings were decent - tiny but crispy and flavorful.

Recommended if you need to feed a crowd!"
__label__4	We attended the country club for a wedding and it was beautiful! Our food was delicious as well-I got the studded chicken, my husband got the short rib. The dance floor was a great size, as well as the whole reception room. My only complaint was there  was no martini glasses for martinis-they were served in wine glasses.
__label__4	"The food is always so fantastic, but I have to complain about the claustrophobic floor plan, loud music and the slow as a snail bus boys.

I have never had a bad meal at Nifty Fifty's. You can order any flavor milkshake and cover everything you order with Cheese Whiz. Who doesn't love that? Just expect to wait in line, unless you want to sit at the counter.

Also, they have crayons, coloring place mats and paper cook hats for the kids. I'm always tempted to ask for a cup or colors for myself to use!"
__label__4	Demmings landing is probably one of the best places for an outdoor theater production. We've been coming to the outdoor theater production for over 17 years and we have never had a disappointing event. Today is no exception the stage is huge, The seating and the fact that you can bring a picnic think that even better. Oh yes and you can drink wine in here enjoy production
__label__4	The food was great and extremely worth the price, but the only issue was the service. It was quite slow and the fact that we had to continuously ask for bread and menus throughout the shift was frustrating. We were so exhausted from our travels, that the slowness was literally putting us to sleep
__label__4	"CVS is a loner ever since the Publix moved across the street.  It is easy to miss, but never busy or crowded so if you're in a rush this is a win.  It's in the old Publix plaza, off Gulf Blvd(22nd S) across from the Sweetbay.  
As I said, the place is never crowded, and always clean and fully stocked.  Parking lot is large and you can always get the number 1 or 2 parking spot."
__label__4	What a great find this place is! My nephew wanted an affordable pack-n-play to keep at my folks' house for when they come to town with his baby. He called in from San Diego and made the purchase via phone - I popped in and picked it up. I keep going back to get stuff for the baby, the deals there are so good! (Especially on gently/hardly used, sometimes top-brand baby clothes.)
__label__4	the staff and the service was cool however what we ordered, the waffle witch, the crepes and the belgian waffles were not so good. the crepes had this nasty strawberry taste, it tasted as if the strawberries had gone bad. the waffle witch and the belgian waffles were too citrus infused. i know it states on the menu but it literally felt like i was biting into a piece of orange. visited here on a vacation and i don't think i would come back second time.
__label__4	So this place was about a .5 mile walk from the Hyatt that I stayed at.  The place is a walk-up and take your brown bag home.  I had the Italian style sandwich which was then grilled similar to a panini.  And I also had the Nutella panino.  Both of which were super tasty!  All of the bread is homemade and you can taste the difference!  The food ingredients are all quality.  I don't believe you will walk away disappointed.
__label__4	I came here at 2:30am looking for late night bar food. I had the hot wings, fries, and 4 monkey beignets. Surprisingly they were all quite tasty and reasonably priced (under $15 after tax). CC is accepted for checks over $10.
__label__4	"(4) ~ very good food & service.  NOTE: Credit Cards can be used at Minimum of $10.  Also, the muffins are around the corner in the glass case.

OUR MENU:
** El Rancho Wrap (w. salsa) = (4.5) Very Good
** Julie's Breakfast Sandwich (Bagel) = (4) very good...uses salami;)
* Raspberry Cream Muffin = (3.5) good
* Iced Coffee = (3.5) good
* Hot Coffee = (3.5) good"
__label__4	"Cute little restaurant where Haley's used to be, and it's a nice place to go for lunch. The sandwiches are really good, and they serve them with ""Italian chips,"" which look kind of like pita chips but are seasoned very nicely. Service was pretty quick too. Prices are fairly reasonable for lunch. I'll probably be back in the future!"
__label__4	Tried it in Atlanta and it was in a little strip mall. I didn't even realize they had sandwiches. Wow what a surprise it was. It tasted great and when I got back to town I found the location here. I tried the kale and apple slaw. It was great it's going to my knew place for sandwiches now. I didn't think kale could taste so good.
__label__4	Ordered delivery for our first time and had four different entrees to share. Excellent quality and generous portions. Will definitely be ordering again.
__label__4	Good food, prices are a little high. The chef has had a tough time with my medium well steak our last 2 visits, but the staff is so motivated to make things right, it all works out.
__label__4	"I hadn't stepped inside since before Katrina. I mostly used this store as I ran to friend's house in the neighborhood. And the store is certainly different now. There are lots of takeout options and the grocery basics.

The staff was nice and offered assistance. And the store was clean. I was confused by the layout but that might be a personal problem. 

+1 star for having Vernor's ginger ale which I haven't seen around NOLA before."
__label__4	I am lactose intolerant and love their marinara pie which is simple yet flavorful. They are decently priced, however I would like the portion size to be a tad bit larger. Other than that service is alway prompt and nice, although I only have done take out.
__label__4	Super nice people, relaxed atmosphere.  Good food.
__label__4	I've been looking for a good mussels place in my travels and Brugge really hit the spot! I ordered the 2lbs of mussels in the class Belgium sauce and every bite was a rich savory flavor, sprinkled with minced garlic and onion pieces. Thus dish also came with a side of perfectly prepared fries with an option for two dipping sauces.i picked the roasted garlic aioli and the herb pesto. I would definitely recommend combining these two together when using the dipping sauces. I'm usually not a big fries person but this made them taste amazing!
__label__4	We had a nice time here.  It was a beautiful day & the deck area is a great place for the view of the bay.  The grouper sandwich is delish and my salmon was tasty.  The service is good, just sit under the awning.  Beware of birds.  Definitely a place to go back to for a relaxed, chill day.
__label__4	Super helpful staff, beautiful artwork. Bought the yelp deal and bought lots of fun treats for family and friends, that really are one-of-a-kind NoLA. Definitely stop by if passing through the area!
__label__4	"Portion size is just right! Very creative place and one of a kind menu. Not your typical Asian dishes, you won't find orange chicken or teriyaki! It is a dining experience. 
Modern decoration. Friendly server."
__label__4	I can't go here and not get a beer and fries!! Obsessed with the fries. Also they have always been so accommodating to large parties that we have, which can be hard for so many restaurants.
__label__4	So far it has been great service and good food. Usually go to the one in south common.
__label__4	went there for the first time last night. was pleasantly surprised not much seating inside but the food was great and our server melissa was awesome.loved the fried green tomatoes.we  definately will make the drive from oldsmar back over there again
__label__4	Great pit stop between flights. Beers are excellent on tap. Can't get much better than Cigar City Maduro. Staff is really friendly and it's nice to be able to grab a sandwich as well. I go through lots of airports and this is always a nice waypoint during my travels.
__label__4	I've eaten here a few times and always been pleased with the food. Authentic BBQ and spicy which i love. Recently the portions got a bit smaller and the prices are not cheap for the type of food. Great place to go when I'm hungry for a great meal and willing to spend a few bucks. Have the brisket and mac and cheese.
__label__4	Quaint location with plenty of elbow room. Came here with coworkers for lunch and had the buffet. This is my first time having Indian cuisine. service was friendly. The buffet menu was very diverse and had great flavor. Staff was very Helpful with allergy restrictions. We even had someone in our party with a sensitive stomach and he managed to find a few things to eat. I would come here again.
__label__4	My husband and I had a blast on the pub crawl. We had a large group of 25 and think it would have been better with a smaller group, but nonetheless less it was fun. Only went to 3 or 4 bars and one we left after one shot  where at other bars we stayed too long. Would have liked to go to more bars for a single drink over just a few bars for a couple of drinks. I would recommend to friends.
__label__4	Such a delicious restaurant but crazy expensive. This place is really only for expense accounts and anniversaries. We had great service and the food was top notch. Did I mention how expensive it is? Way out of line but I guess it's a once a year place.
__label__4	Family owned business.  Great food.  Huge portions on fish and other plates.  Very homey and cozy feel to this place.  Lots of seating.  Just a nice place to eat
__label__4	A very interesting little museum. Lots of great classic and antique cars. A good way to pass a couple hours immersed in America's auto heritage.
__label__4	Great craft shop where all things crafty can be found in one store.  They also have a great selection of seasonal decor and gifts.
__label__4	My cousin is a local and works in a restaurant. so, when he suggested this place I knew we were going to be OK. It was just a few minutes walk from our hotel which was a nice plus. We had excellent service, good solid drink pours and very good food. The place is rather small so reservations will assure you a table. This will go on my list of NOLA favorites, but there are so many great places to choose from. You will not be disappointed with a dinner here! Check it out!
__label__4	This is one of our go-to restaurants for a good, affordable, BYOB meal in a semi-casual atmosphere.
__label__4	Great pedicure. Been here half a dozen times and never had a problem. Not sure why negative ratings when I've always had great service. Lots of colors to chose from. Nice and clean salon.
__label__4	If there is a better Mexican spot in University City I would like to know about it
__label__4	I don't care what anyone says... this place is amazing.  Maybe I love it more for the amazing memories than the actual establishment... but think about it... it's Circus Circus.  It's not supposed to be a 5 star hotel.  Anyway my friend and I only stayed one night as a pit stop on a road trip.  The hotel stay was super cheap, we gambled and drank at the bar, and then played all the kiddy games.  My only complaint is that the kiddy game area didn't stay open late enough.
__label__4	The crawfish etouffe over biscuits with gravy topped with two poached eggs was great and super filling. If you are into crawfish, definitely check this breakfast out.
__label__4	Very good food and great prices. Great place for happy hour. The service is always good. You may have to wait for a table depending on the day and time you go, but it's worth the wait!
__label__4	So far, this is the best dim sum in town.  It's a bit on the pricey side but the variety is excellent.  Very authentic, my mom gets the chicken feet whenever she goes.  They only have the dim sum carts on weekend brunch, otherwise you have to order off the dim sum menu.  Other menu items are good but a bit overpriced.  This is not cheap chinese take out but if you are hankering for authentic, high quality chinese food this is the place.  Still I agree with the other reviews, the price is the reason we don't go more often.
__label__4	Great BBQ.  Fun atmosphere, great service, and delicious food.  They have great biscuits and the best corn pudding I've ever had.  Their bbq is delicious and they have a great selection to choose from.
__label__4	I love Sam's but was very disappointed when I called today to find out the hours for Santa Claus as I was hoping to take my 2 year old grandson by Saturday the 23rd. I just recently had injections in my neck and was unable to take him this past weekend but when I just called I found out that he was only at Sam's Club for one weekend during the whole holiday season, which happened to be this past weekend. Very disappointed. I mean who wants to pay $20+ for ONE 5X7 picture with Santa at the mall?!
__label__4	I have enjoyed their services twice and will continue to go back. The guys here are always friendly, helpful, not pushy and as promised fast. I get the full synthetic oil, the price is reasonable and love that I can go twice as far so it saves me time too. Probably the worst part of going here is getting in and out of the location due to the construction on ulmerton. I find the great service is worth that trouble every time I stop by through.
__label__4	I would definitely recommend! Food was really good and fresh! The waiter was very nice and informative in the beginning, but after taking our order, he didn't really check in on us and kind of disappeared. The menu has a wide variety of interesting food that is hard to find anywhere else! The food is worth the price and perfect for a nice meal!
__label__4	Been here a couple times and the food is excellent. Love the location so close to everything, but the service has been hit and miss. However definitely someplace I drill return, and often
__label__4	Love this place.  What a variety!  And free soft serve ice cream?!?!? That I can swirl myself??!  What??!!?!?  Nom nom nom!!!  Best of the menu?  Caprese panini!!! Yum!   Oh don't worry, I'll be back.  And I'm bringing my family!
__label__4	A very nice, upscale restaurant off State Street.  Smaller menu but quality. I had the duck confit and my partner had a dinner salad. Both were excellent.
__label__4	I've found myself coming here a lot because it's right by the greyhound station, and it's a very solid banh mi joint. The lemongrass tofu option is a nice differentiator--lots of flavor and vegetarian-friendly. The meat banh mis could stand to have a bit more filling, but that's a small quibble. The owners/staff are all super friendly, and I'm always happy to return here.
__label__4	Had a late lunch here today!  The club Panini hit the spot.  I was especially pleased that the bread was dry and crunchy.
__label__4	Pretty busy location.  I only had drinks but o felt it was a good location that I would definitely return.  Definitely worth a try if in the area.
__label__4	Pork Tan Tan was good, for take out I don't think they cook the noodles so I had to heat them up for quite a while before it was edible. Otherwise taste really good. Had the takoyaki as well really good.
__label__4	The employee that answered my call when I couldn't find the entrance was nice. I ordered an everything bagel, I included pics. I really like everything bagels bc they're exactly that, sesame, poppyseed, etc. The bagel I got was something, yes. Everything, no.There was ALOT of lox and there was alot of smear on only 1 side of the bagel .
__label__4	Went today for the first time.  I was looking for something light and quick for a late lunch.  The spinach and goat cheese crepe that I ordered exactly hit the bill.  It was tasty and perfectly cooked.  Service was fast and friendly.  The menu was extensive and something that I'd love to try another time.  Looking around the room some of the sweet crepes looked and sounded amazing.
__label__4	"I wandered in here after a cut at Twisted and had a great experience. One of the best foot massages I've ever gotten with a pedicure. The place was relaxing and the staff were friendly and attentive. Given the price, the nice hours, and my satisfaction, this is  my new go to place. 
I got a pedicure with paraffin for $30. Cheaper than a number of other places where I've gotten that combination."
__label__4	Go here or take out here - generous exceptional food - they had me at the salsa - could not stay for the in house experiece - but it just felt fun
__label__4	The mahi-mahi varadero was delicious! I loved both the fish and the yellow rice that came with it. The queso fundito was mainly tomatoes, very little cheese, so that was a bit disappointing. Overall, the food was good and the ambiance was very nice!
__label__4	McAlister's has amazing customer service for a fast food restaurant. It's like Panera 2.0. One of my favorite things about it is their pickle jar. Last time I was here and it took them like 10 minutes to refill it which was mildly annoying. The drinks are stupidly large but I don't mind it especially since I enjoy staying hydrated. The ciabatta is fantastic and so is their soup. They don't have garden salsa sun chips though which I was bad about.
__label__4	Great food and awesome beer....I would definitely recommend this place.  Justin...thanks for a wonderful experience.
__label__4	"Always busy, and a little cramped. But the food is great, as is the service!

I always get the sausage gravy. It's a good sized portion of home made gravy on top of yummy biscuits. 

The waitresses are quick to fill my cup. The place is clean"
__label__4	The service was exceptional. My husband and I haven't been in years because we weren't fond of it before. We got a gift card and decided to go again. From the moment we walked in the door we were treated A+. We cannot rave enough about every single employee. It was truly a team effort by each and everyone that walked passed us. Great job Scotty, our waiter and the entire staff. Can't wait to return!!
__label__4	"A slow start with a service malaise....and the untenable ( for me) use of Pepsi products gave way to a wonderful basket of crisp thick cut fries and remarkably delicious burger. Mine came with bacon and I added habanero cheese.

The restaurant is more a "" hall "", but who cares about ambiance when the burgers are this great?"
__label__4	"When I think of BBQ in Tucson, I think of BrushFire.  I love the ribs, brisket, pulled pork, and the pit beef.  Fries are good, as well as the mac and cheese.  Sauces are good, something for those that prefer the sweet or the vinegary side of things.

The restaurant is little small for me as I hate to be crowded, so I visit between meals (2-3pm) or I get it to go."
__label__4	When I'm in the mood for Italian, this place always come to mind. I've gone here with a large group of guys and on a date and both times the service and food were great. There food is pretty basic Italian recipes and they don't try to get overly creative. They stick to everyone's favorites and aim to please. The prices are reasonable and they take reservations which is a plus for large groups.  I always leave stuffed and happy.
__label__4	They have good food for a reasonable price and they give HUGE portions. Get the Grilled Chicken Plate all the way! Mmm.
__label__4	I recently moved to Reno from Oregon and a friend of mine recommended Brasserie for birthday drinks and appetizers. This place has somewhat of a Portland-esque vibe, minus the beards and plaid. The drinks were great (loved my sparkling sangria, beer selection was good too), food was excellent, atmosphere was pleasant and casual, and servers were attentive and knowledgeable. I'll definitely be going back for happy hour.
__label__4	I really liked the look and feel of this place- bacon meets nerdy. A really eclectic verging on hipster vibe. I however wasn't super wowed by my food- granted, I got a BLT. It was good, just nothing spectacular (though can you expect spectacular from a BLT?). Everyone else's food at my table looked delicious, even if I didn't get to taste it. I'd definitely give it a try if I were you, but maybe try something more adventurous than the BLT.
__label__4	We went here yesterday morning after hearing that they are requiring patrons to wear a mask during this covid pandemic. THANK YOU! We got a butter croissant, prosciutto & gruyere croissant, the Milky Way tart and the Framboise Verveine. We absolutely loved everything except the Framboise Verveine, it was just so so for us. With that being said we have absolutely nothing to compare it to because we've never had this dessert before. We will definitely be going back, we recommend everything else.
__label__4	The Capital Mall State Park isn't just a scenic route from Germantown to Downtown, but it's a fun and educational experience. There's tons of things to see, including a WWII memorial and a gigantic tiled floor map of Tennessee. It was also lovely to walk through in the winter, with all of the different trees covered in frost.
__label__4	Great food great service.  A bit pricy, hence the 4 stars.  The wait staff are very friendly.
__label__4	"YUM!
I got the turkey bacon ranch  sandwich and DEMOLISHED it! 
It was amazing! 

My mom got a Reuban and loved it and my sister got the buffalo chicken sandwich and said it was the best she had ever had! 
3 people just sandwiches was around $20"
__label__4	Pretty much the same as Rave Theaters.....good location, very comfortable seating.... Can grab a bite too eat inside before u catch a movie. Just gotta be over 21 thou...soon they be serving alcoholic drinks and food have so enjoy with ya movie.
__label__4	"This place serves their lunch and dinner menu all day! Who wakes up at 9:00am and wants Red Beans and Rice? This chick. And it was excellent! It was served with gator sausage which was grilled to perfection. The boyfriend ordered chicken and waffles. The chicken was marinated in a spicy glaze which he really liked. 

Ambiance here is fabulous. Dark, old room with old fixtures. Andrew Jackson and Jean Lafitte met here to discuss plans for what would come to be known as the Battle of New Orleans. 

Pure NOLA."
__label__4	feeling and looking good! another great experience at mars Venus they are oh so nice and my hair looks wonderful I got a new sassy cut, a beautiful color, with highlights. The salons gorgeous, the stylist are very good and the owner a strong, beautiful, professional women runs a great salon! I highly recommend going there. I have had nothing but a good experience, every time I go there.                          Thanks ladys!
__label__4	For a chain steakhouse, I haven't had better. The food was unique from the lobster queso, sesame crusted salmon, and the herb crusted prime rib.  The rib was cooked to perfection, and my wife raved about the salmon. the service was fast and friendly.  This was our first visit to this restaurant, and it made a great first impression.
__label__4	I love this restaurant. I got the chicken teriyaki and the Thai mango. Amazing dishes I go here all the time. Though sometimes the rice isn't well done but  most of the time it is
__label__4	Stopped here for breakfast on our way back to the Bay Area from Santa Barbara. We sat at the picnic tables out front (we had our dog with us) and ordered inside. Despite a little mix-up with our order, we enjoyed ourselves. It didn't hurt that the singer Pink was at the table directly behind us (seriously). I would recommend the breakfast panini. My wife enjoyed a vegetarian breakfast burrito. Coffee was tasty and came with free refills.
__label__4	I had the Fathead with the beans and collards. Very enjoyable. Great sandwich. Great menu. Great service. The only knock is that there is not enough seating for a group lunch trip. Great for takeout only. Order ahead for fast service.
__label__4	Prices are cheap to on par with everyone else in the area.  Good mixed drinks!  The bar does not serve food, but there's always a food truck (at least tacos and / or hotdogs) outside, with GOOD food.
__label__4	Solid 4 stars. I stopped by Lona's again and got the same rice paper wrap (chicken, stir fry, and sesame sauce). Delicious. I was feeling reckless so I went ahead and ordered some chicken spring rolls. The wrap and the spring rolls together put it over the top--I couldn't finish it all. I ended up saving the rest for a very delicious breakfast. I will definitely be back.
__label__4	"Home. Made.
I thought my mom was in the kitchen waiting to ambush me.
The chicken soup is fantastic and the staff very friendly.
Highly recommend!"
__label__4	"These chicken fingers were delicious! 
Friendly service coupled with tasty beers and lots of laughs. I'll be back for more"
__label__4	Ordered today from work because my coworker suggested it after I waited an hour for jimmy johns yesterday and I was super impressed with the speed of delivery.  It was here in 15 minutes! The ordering process was easy and I love how they kept me informed of when it left their site and was on their way to me.  Also loved how I got a survey after delivery. I will definitely order from there again.  I got the mac and cheese with pulled pork, it was a tad bland (which is why I only gave 4 stars) but overall the service was phenomenal.
__label__4	Delicious surprise! And the Price is Right. Like the chicken hibachi better than the steak.
__label__4	So don't come here for kale infused cocktails, but if you want to hang out at a casual bar that allows smoking and has darts, pool and other parlor games, then this is a great place. Also the bartenders pour generous.
__label__4	Swanky's Taco Shop is a good Taco restaurant.  I really like the way they have their meat seasoned.  Try it.
__label__4	Awesome off the tourist path Salvadoran food. Everything was great. Came for breakfast.  I'm happy it's open on Sunday! It's a small place and gets busy so you will have to wait for your food but it's worth it.  Jugo de Jamaica or Marañon or Mango were delicious. Prices are very reasonable.
__label__4	Glad to have a diner in the area that's not a chain restaurant. Food was very tasty and service was great, Will be back again!
__label__4	Most the time I can find what I need when it comes to guitar accessories, parts, cables and such.  The consistency of the quality of the guitars is hit or miss until you get to the $1,000 range. And then it gets a little more reliable.  Overall a go-to store when I'm in a pinch.
__label__4	"Huge & more selection compared to other Aldi's

-Wide isles
-more designated organic produce
-more trays of produce to choose from
-more non-perishables (kitchen utensils, special buys)

They had 2 lanes open for check-out on a weekday!

Overall- It's still an Aldi's just bigger."
__label__4	The fried oyster appetizer and red sangria were both amazing!
__label__4	This place has a huge menu that can accommodate anyone! Friendly service and a laid back, casual atmosphere. I didnt see any alcohol on the menu so I dont think they serve it. I wasnt a fan of that aspect as I wanted to celebrate with a beer.
__label__4	Great store, clean, friendly employees but this one seems a bit smaller than their other stores.  It's a handy location so I'll deal with the negatives!
__label__4	I wish there were more seats at the bar, but there are plenty of tables.  The beer sampler is an awesome deal with six glasses of what I'd guess are 8 oz each of a variety of local beers.
__label__4	I had a really great burger here, the Sam Elliot, but the fries were disappointing and cold. My kid got a reuben that they loved. We split the fennel falafel salad, it was just okay by me. Cocktails were yummy but we passed on dessert. The macarons looked a bit old and soggy sitting in the case near the front desk. The service was pleasant and attentive. We'll try again and hopefully we'll get some great fries that I'd heard about.
__label__4	Great food, great cocktails, awesome service and a super chill vibe.  Hands down my favorite restaurant in Boise.
__label__4	It's Chipotle. The food is good, not great, but good. The service here is great though. Very friendly and take the time to throw in some small talk while making your food.
__label__4	Sandwich was huge.  Took half home with me.  We went there on Friday and they had half of the drinks, which was nice. All their sandwiches have fries in the middle.  It's their signature.
__label__4	I've tried this place twice. And the first time i did come the food was good, i ordered a grilled cheese with chicken. The second time i got bulgogi fries, they were good but just had a little too much salt. Service was okay.
__label__4	"Good when your in a hurry and want a cup of soup or a hot sandwich!  Its a big step above fast food but not somewhere I would go for ""dinner out"". Bagels are amazing and the soup in the bread bowls is also quite tasty!"
__label__4	I haven't yet tried the Korean cuisine, but this is a solid place for a meal salad and quick lunch. The staff is friendly, although there is occasionally a language barrier. It seems like the menu was developed without training the staff, so specifically requesting a defined salad from the menu doesn't communicate anything to them. Just go along the line saying what you want. Quality ingredients and a great value!
__label__4	Went here a few weeks ago for a friends wedding, and it was great! The views during sunset in the City Club awesome! The staff that worked the wedding were really great and the bartenders sure know how to make a good drink. The venue in not huge, so at times it felt crowded. But, it was a party and we were all having a great time. So who cares!
__label__4	Love the Fish tacos!! You  get your money's worth. The Crab legs??? Very small amount. Very big price. But that is the only reason I am not giving 5 stars. The employees are professional and nice
__label__4	"We come here all the time. Perfect spot before a show at the Fox Theater or Powell Hall. We'll even go here before a show or sporting even downtown. 
Great wine list, great beer & cocktail list, and the food is awesome. I loved, loved, loved the Tuscan salad - it has chicken, awesome dressing and even a perfect amount of jalapeno to spice it up. I can't get enough of it. Service is spotty, but they're always super busy so I can understand. Highly recommend you get a reservation on OpenTable before going."
__label__4	Wow. What a selection. For album aficionados this is a great place. Loads of selection. I don't know many people that still have a turntable but if you do, this is a must-visit. They don't have everything because of course this is a specialty market but they might have what you're looking for....
__label__4	The tour was great!  A nice walk through the French Quarter with each stop offering a sampling of all the dishes that you would expect to try during a NOLA visit - jambalaya, red beans and rice, praline candy, gumbo, and etouffee.  Excellent tour for your Day 1 to help map out future eats during your stay.
__label__4	Everything is fresh fresh....hope the turn it into a tacobell/KFC combo...staff is very accommodating
__label__4	"Always a good burger 
Stop by many times
Closer than Pottstown
Bacon double my favorite"
__label__4	One of my favorite places for crawfish in Metairie. It's a small, family run restaurant with FOB seafood.
__label__4	"This place hands down has the best pistachio gelato ever... EVER!!!!! I've been to many other gelato places and I always compare them to this place's. No artificial almond flavor. They have unique flavors that they rotate around.

This place will always be my gelato place..."
__label__4	Pete was a good driver and he had the best price as well. I would use him again if in sba
__label__4	I hand a very interesting winter squash salad, more meat and less lettuce than I am used to but it was good.  I had the mussels, an they were outstanding, with a nice Smokey taste and were substantial.  They also have a nice selection of draft beers and wines.
__label__4	"Great place went with friends over a early dinner and had a great time. the wait was a bit of a drag
the seafood paella is to die for and you can get it without the chorizo for those who don't eat pork."
__label__4	"Pro: Beautiful restaurant, friendly staff, panna cotta dessert was incredible, lamb loin was tender/melts in your mouth, lovely wine selection.

Con: Garlic soup was way too strong and over whelming, would not recommend ordering.  Eggplant caviar was bland and boring.

But seriously do not order the garlic soup."
__label__4	Loved the tour and hearing about the history of free people of color which I had not heard before. I recommend making a stop here if you are visiting NOLA. Call ahead to get their tour times.
__label__4	Hidden gem along the river! Their blackened fish was so delicious, lots of blackening seasoning and cooked perfectly. Their peel and eat shrimp can be ordered warm or cold which I enjoy because I like them warm. Definitely will go back!
__label__4	Really enjoyed a late dinner breakfast here last night.  Breakfast items were good and large portions (I enjoyed breakfast flatbread very much) Jose was our server and he was excellent- very helpful and friendly for our party of 6!  No crowded - no waiting. We are staying at The Roosevelt so will probably go back for bagels before we leave town!
__label__4	"Much like the D. review I would like to have done 3.5 stars on this one.  Now between the two of us it averages to that so there's a victory for all the mathletes.  
The pizza is quite serviceable and the prices are reasonable.  They send out coupons almost too often and even if you don't have your coupon with you they honor it anyway."
__label__4	Overall great tapas. They have a little of everything, but some are better than others. The tuna and octopus ceviche,  steak with leeks,  and pork shank where all great. Would also definitely recommend the sangria. However,  the chorizo was just an average generic sausage and the chicken dish we had was nothing to write home about.
__label__4	"good place for a quick meal to satisfy your kbbq craving. the burritos here are pretty cheap and filling. usually get the spicy pork or beef, cant go wrong with either one.
small fee for card"
__label__4	the new Orleans experience is not complete without paying a visit to this establishment and trying a po'boy sandwich and some jambalaya..You will fall in love..mothers has a line out the door because of it's popularity ..but also for it's amazing food and it is worth the wait...Believe me this place is worth the hype
__label__4	"This seems like a branch for a bigger location.  But it has very pretty items and several different price points.  I was a little disappointed that there wasn't more variety in the case items, but maybe that was just the day I popped in.

The boxes and cookies are beautifully wrapped and decorated.  I just find the enrobing chocolate a bit blah, but that's just my personal taste."
__label__4	Ate here a few times the food is pretty good, one time I had a very excellent filet mignon went back a few weeks later to have the same steak and it was off the menu, I hope they bring it back. The servers are very nice and do a good job. The beer selection is very good, bartenders are alright. Go on Wednesday evenings to see Mike Mcguire, he is an acoustic guitar player and singer and is very entertaining.
__label__4	Yum, steak tacos and white sangria! I think the entrees are way too expensive, and the salsa has GOT to change, but the tacos are yummy and cheap. That's what I'd definitely go for. The margs are good too!
__label__4	"Wife was looking for a place to eat on northwest side of Tucson . She was googling and found Guiseppe's. I wanted Italian.  We had eggplant
Parmesan, minestone soup , garden salad,
Seafood soup. Food was tasty and delicious.
Waiter was friendly and service was good. Entrees were served nice and hot .
Will return to restaurant every time we visit Tucson."
__label__4	Loved this place, will def be coming back next time I'm in town. We just had wings And a couple brews out on their patio, so I'll need to try more of their food next time. Service was great, good ambiance and wings were tasty.
__label__4	First and foremost, they do not serve pizza or Stromboli anymore.  Maybe want to drop that from your business name , lol  Cheesesteak is bountiful.  Conshohocken bakery roll.  Good chesse.  Meat could be better.  John's Roast Pork is still my #1 in Philly area, but Mama's makes my top 10.
__label__4	wonderful location on State Street.  Food was very fresh and it was a great value.  Pea soup was thick and delicious.  Definitely recommend!
__label__4	We always dine here when we visit Tucson. Food & drinks have been good & consistent all these years.
__label__4	"My girls (6 of us) and I booked a day of self care and pampering first stop massages.  I opted for the relaxation massage, 90 minutes of bliss ‍.

There are 2 floors and everyone felt relaxed and ready for the next stop for our self care day."
__label__4	This place is special. I rarely write reviews but I was inspired tonight. Great food, great service, great atmosphere and music.
__label__4	"Great little Thai spot. I've been wanting to try this place since I moved to palm harbor, and I'm so glad I did! 

The steamed dumplings were some of the best I've had, and there were very fresh vegetables in the entrees. I also felt that medium spice was right on par, and mild was very mild. 

The atmosphere was nice for dinner, and the wait staff was very attentive. We will definitely be back!"
__label__4	Went for an early dinner during happy hour - super relaxed but classy place and a solid happy hour menu. Friendly service. Their full menu has fantastic options as well.
__label__4	I've ordered delivery from here numerous times and I really like this place because service is prompt. I've never had any issues with any of my delivery orders and their delivery person is really nice. Their pizza is also really good! Try their chicken Caesar salad as well.
__label__4	I ordered salmon salad panzanella! It was awesome! I really like this restaurant, it has a great menu - varieties of food choices. All options looked fresh, healthy and high end cuisine!
__label__4	On our recent Road-trip from San Diego to Santa Cruz the gang and I used Yelp to find all of our eating spots, and it was a big success! This place was my top choice for the best food on our week long adventure. We were lucky enough to arrive for Happy Hour and discovered a long list of yummy food & drinks at great prices. The best item? Grilled Cheese with honey & truffle oil for $4-! I want to eat it again! Check in and get some great calamari as well, we did!
__label__4	The food was execellent!  Our server gave great advice on what to select.  Will go back!
__label__4	Came in here on a slow Tuesday night. The service itself I would give 3 Stars because everything took way too long to get to our table. We saw our drinks that we ordered just waiting at the bar for almost 10 minutes before it was brought to our table and the restaurant was basically empty! Food also takes a while to get on the table so don't come absolutely starving. The food itself I found very tasty and well cooked. We ordered the lamb and branzino and was not disappointed at all. I feel like I would likely order takeout here but may not dine in next time!
__label__4	I love Madeira Beach and it's beach fronts! Our Holiday Halfathon Starting Line was at City Hall this past Dec. I've been to several arts & crafts shows and plan to do the Mad Beach Triathlon here this year! It's well managed and the main beach road is always monitored for speeders! We're laid back here in Paradise. Great cafes, restaurants, and bars are in this little town as well as excellent resorts! Mad Beach rocks!
__label__4	This is a little hidden gem in a Little neighborhood Wilmington called Bellefonte witch lots of cute little shops and an alternative feel. The menu had lots of vegetarian options which is not always east to find. We had the stuffed avocado (with hummus) and beet salad. The homemade hummus was really good! I read from other reviews that the service was slow, but I found them to be really promt and attentive. I can't wait to go back.
__label__4	"The gym and bathrooms are both very clean.  They have lots of equipment and floor area.  This location has a pool. 

I'm on a trial membership coz I just moved here."
__label__4	Four stars only because I waited about 45 min or more for a table! The staff was super friendly, the guy taking the names at the door was never annoyed when I asked how much longer, he was kind and apologetic. When we finally got a table I was super happy with the many choices, I am on a strict diet and I loved I could eat great food and stay within my program! I ordered the farmhouse omelette and it was sssoooo good! So much flavor and the veggie fritters were tasty! I will totally be back ... I am a fan!
__label__4	Great spot. Interesting food and drink. They know their stuff and care about it. It shows thru in the service and hospitality.
__label__4	Easy parking - Lots of space for a group or party. enjoyed the atmosphere a lot!  Menu will accomodate wide array of appetites
__label__4	Was in Nashville for a conference a couple of weeks ago and the locals around the area I was in recommended this or Rippy's but we choose to lunch at this place. The prices were ridiculously cheap and the food was sooo bomby! A taste of real southern cooking. There were only three of us that ate here but we ordered a full rack of ribs, hot links, 4 orders of 1/2pint sides, corn bread, and three beers for a little under $40! Now that's a deal for some good bbq!
__label__4	"The food was finger-licking good (although see below)! I had fried chicken, meatloaf, mac-n-cheese, and strawberry shortcake!

The only thing I would have changed is the server asking the patrons to not lick their fingers and to actually clean them before touching the serving bowls and utensils. Just something like that to help prevent the spread of germs."
__label__4	Have been back twice recently. I had read that they had adjusted their menu some. My husband had the hot fish sandwich (which might not be new just new to us). My brother had the salmon. The salmon looked like a small portion to my brother for the cost at first but he raved about how well it was cooked and seasoned. Also, they've added happy hour drink specials and a patio. We love this place!
__label__4	Good food!  Timely and quick delivery to home!  Nice girl answers for orders! Rarely, and I mean extremely rare, any problems - I think the worst was weather related like a blizzard!
__label__4	I stumbled across Tony's little place as it's right near my house. I needed a snap replaced on my motorcycle pants, and he put one on while I waited, and didn't charge me a thing! I will definitely be going back to Tony for some alterations I need done to a suit.
__label__4	I have been a patron of this location for many years. Never has let me down like many other locations. Service is extremely efficient. By the time you're done your order they have your drink for you. The staff are very nice as well! Food and bakery items are standard to all Dunkin stores but are still satisfying. Parking can be a little hairy due to the limited spaces (can get crowded in the AM) but otherwise this location is great!
__label__4	It's alright. I thought Bouchon's had better service / wine selection.
__label__4	Was traveling to see family for the holiday. Needed to get snow tires and change oil before the long drive. Everyone was nice. Took a bit longer then expected. Thats why i am giving 4 stars instead of 5. However, they where also busy. The store manager did his best to make me comfortable while i waited. Even offered to make me coffee. Will absolutely return!
__label__4	Shrimp tempura roll was mediocre   My husband really liked the sliders. Our waitress was very attentive and service was great. Can't beat the atmosphere!  Even though we didn't get the wings, they looked great
__label__4	"Delicious dinner. She had the Santa Barbara Salad with chicken and I had the seafood tacos with shrimp, rice, and black beans. 

The portions were plentiful. I'm grateful for outdoor seating because it was such a lovely evening. 

Out-of-towners, we'll be back for breakfast in the morning. 

Staff seems friendly but you walk up to order so we only interacted with the one person at the cash register. 

Enjoy!"
__label__4	"Went here over Easter! The line was long but moved at a quick pace.... $10 for a cheesesteak without the ""Whiz"" but with grilled peppers! Yum - not greasy, but juicy!"
__label__4	"Seems like a tourist trap, but it isn't! Great spot for a girls lunch or Happy Hour.
Perfect people watching on State Street"
__label__4	I'm very glad this place opened in channelside, the rolls and salads are fantastic still have a few things to try here. I hope they expand their menu in the future and add some of the dishes that the downtown restaurant offers...friendly staff and quiet atmosphere.
__label__4	Had a large group meeting and eating here.  I was so impressed with the food.  Our server didn't let our coffee cup get even half way down and she was there.  I couldn't have been more impressed.  Took orders quickly for large group and everything was cook properly.  I really liked this place and will return.
__label__4	Amazing authentic shanghainese soup dumplings, other stuff not amazing.  Best to go at a non rush time, like midafternoon during the week.
__label__4	We've been searching for a good Chinese restaurant and found it in Mt. Juliet! The service is fast and friendly, the atmosphere is nice and the food is fresh and flavorful.  The one item that could be improved is the fried rice, but we are used to it having lots of soy and vegetables added in and most places here don't serve it that way. My hard-to-please husband enjoys the Sushi. This is a great spot to gather with friends to share and sample from an extensive menu.
__label__4	Wow, the food is great, but what's up with the music??? It's like being in a dance club with a booming drum beat going nonstop. Food deserves 5 stars, music -1, for a total of 4 stars. Please, we love your food, but the thumping loud music has got to go!
__label__4	Delivered to us hot! Super delicious. And not greasy! I love the Kona with the cheddar cheese, and the white pizza with oil and different cheeses. Drooling.
__label__4	Toppings were fresh. Staff was friendly. Cooked up very good when we got home. Recommend Papa Murphy's and recommend this location.
__label__4	Mad Fish is a must if you're visiting or live here!  Later hours than most of the beach eateries & the best Teriyaki Glazed Salmon with sticky rice. Like the high end diner decorum!  Service is always on point. Hats off to the chef!
__label__4	The best chicken parm sandwich ever! I've also had their chicken cutlet sandwiches and hoagies. So good. It's huge so one sandwich can be two meals. They also have hot foods (cheesesteaks which they are known for on Food Network). The cheesesteaks and sides are also delicious. I definitely recommend calling ahead because this place can get so busy!
__label__4	I really enjoyed Pucketts! I loved the atmosphere, the service was great, and the food was amazing!
__label__4	The wife and I recently checked this place out for brunch.  Ill keep it simple.  Service was good, place was nice, food was good.  Southern inspired brunch hit the spot...Ill be back to check out the she-crab soup..
__label__4	"We were here with a large group 14+ people.  They did a very nice job of accommodating a group that size.  I started with the crab meat cheese cake- to-die-for!  Followed by the pecan crusted catfish which was excellent.  This was all followed up with the white chocolate creme brûlée...it was fine, but one bite was enough, I'd opt for something different the next time.

The atmosphere was a bit noisy and the restaurant was freezing. Bring a sweater."
__label__4	Stopped here for a quick drink and we're surprised to meet the man himself! He was very nice. Our bartender was very friendly and provided nice service. Cool atmosphere in here too. Cannot speak for the food as we didn't eat anything.
__label__4	Unique space serving brunch and great coffee. Solid free WiFi. Tried the slinger and avacado toast. Both are excellent
__label__4	Yes go, you need that burger! Homemade patties and thick cut bacon...need I say more. Ordered through Uber eats, loved that it arrived nice and warm due to the packaging. The fries were homemade and still had a nice crunchy when it arrived.
__label__4	"Great experience! They have cookies on the table equivalent to chips and salsa at a mexican restaurant. We had all kinds of chocolate drink concoctions. Also, we had truffles which were a little too rich but delicious nonetheless. It was pretty pricey, but we were paying for the ambiance. 
The theme of the bathrooms is alice in wonderland. I thought that it was pretty clever since you go down the stairs to go to the bathroom. 

The downside: we stood in line for about 30 minutes blocking the doorway and getting in trouble with the waitress. I just wanted to sit down so badly."
__label__4	The fried chicken was delicious & moist.  The green beans tasted like they came from a can. Mac n cheese was great.
__label__4	Had dinner here. Staff was friendly and helpful with choosing menu items, and the food came out very fast! Egg drop soup and sesame chicken were excellent. Avoid the mo shu chicken, very bland, very disappointing.
__label__4	This is a genuine type of restaurant.  When it's busy  it is busy - all the staff is running 100 mph and things can be a bit unsettling.  No worries all the food is fresh, good ingredients, and made with love.  I've had almost everything and starting to rotate dishes.  4 stars cause they are keeping it real.  Some of the seasonings / taste is inconsistent, serving sizes also vary at times but its never bad and nobody is trying to get over on you.
__label__4	"Yum loved the food, especially the Queso Fundido app. Great flavor with the choriza and really like how they did the peppers separately.
We are always looking for a good Mexican restaurant and so many times have been disappointed. Good margaritas and sangria too. This one is our new favorite!"
__label__4	100 % like this place and good for us , delicious hot dog from here. Coming back  next time with more rate.
__label__4	The soup is good, ramen, ummm, i guess its ok~
__label__4	Good BBQ at decent prices.  If you are in the area, stop in and give they a try.
__label__4	"Good service, nice selection of appetizers, food and drinks on the menu. The fresh tofu rolls were excellent. The pho was good but not great. I've been here twice for lunch and dinner and got a table right away. 
Seems to be run with care and efficiency....solid four stars."
__label__4	Even during quarantine, this local eatery knows how to provide excellent service and delicious food. Ordering food from Mama Flora's was quick and easy, and the food was ready very soon. The staff was very courteous and our order was perfect. The food was delicious and the portions were substantial.
__label__4	Everything was very good and prepared in a unique way! This is definitely a vegan place though. Everything we ordered was vegetables so it was a lighter meal and maybe not the cheapest food for what you get.
__label__4	Checked this place out because a friend recommended the fish and chips, and did not disappoint. Servings are huge and everything is fresh. My parents split an entre of fish and chips and that filled them up. I had delicious shepards pie and washed it down with a shandy.
__label__4	Just went in for a slab of ribs, coleslaw, baked beans, and greens. Don't forget the pecan pie! Everything was excellent. The ribs are tender and seasoned just right. Sides are delicious and the pecan pie is awesome! The place was crowded for lunch and the service was fast. Uncle Rodney is a hard working individual and deserves our support for his fine food. Thumbs up sir!
__label__4	"Service was adequate. My buffalo burger was excellent. Hubby had s Hugh protein burger and said was very good and didn't make him feel full at all. 

Beautiful place but a little pricey"
__label__4	A family-style Southern me you won't ever forget. From the communal seating, rules that you can't be on your cell phone during dinner and the made-from-scratch approach, this is comfort food at its finest, particularly the super tasty and gender fried chicken, homemade biscuits and white gravy and the meatloaf. Could do without skins skins in mashed potatoes and the pulled pork was dry and bland. Otherwise little to quibble about here.
__label__4	Excellent service, beautiful presentation, great atmosphere, unique & delicious food!
__label__4	Had a windshield replaced had a problem but was very impressed how they sorted the problem out final result was good and would not only use them again but would recommend them Thanks for help
__label__4	This new ballroom studio offers instruction in waltz, foxtrot, tango, rumba, cha Cha cha, salsa, bachata,  cumbia, swing, nightclub two step, country two step, line dancing, and youth classes. The first lesson is complimentary and the owner offers many packages for beginning lessons,  wedding lessons,  private and group lessons.  There's a dance social every Friday night. The free initial consultation allows both student and instructor to evaluate their compatibility. Come down and tell Irene that I recommended her studio.
__label__4	"My first time at this venue 

Parking easy and walking distance not cheap but I guess average 

Walking distance to restaurants and bars and neat shops on second st 

Fillmore is clean and well lit very nice venue the seats are very uncomfortable something you would see at a high school graduation 

Sound was good and not too loud

Cool chandeliers reminiscent of winterland in San Francisco ( see the last waltz movie to get the reference)

I'd go here again!!"
__label__4	The bar in this inn is great.  Large.  When you sit down your not on top of anyone.  They make the best BLT sandwich in Chester County!!
__label__4	We consistently receive good service and food when we dine at this location. Our favorite entrees are the cajun chicken littles and smokehouse bbq burger. Their skinny flatbreads are excellent as well.
__label__4	"It's fine enough...like a Diner.  I am not expecting gourmet when we eat at Perkins.  Way better than Denny's!

Good quick service, clean and good desserts.  They are very good with children also. Make sure to check out the specials and new items."
__label__4	"I have been going to the 19th Hole for many years and it has always been good food, especially for a golf course.
They have a great hot dog, chips, and beer selection for the passer by as you hit the turn into the back 9 holes.
I also attend a business networking group in the morning occasionally and have breakfast.
It is always average to good, and never bad.
4 stars is a great rating based on the food quality, prices, and the friendly staff!"
__label__4	"Great, authentic, fresh bahn mi -- but that's only one half of the story.

The hidden star here is the fantastic cilantro-tinged congee, which is the steal of the year at only 3.00 per quart.  Go get yourself a sandwich and a quart of congee for breakfast the next day -- this place is a hidden gem."
__label__4	"I love The Rack on Sundays, for hospitality night... I definitely wouldn't pay normal prices though. They always have a band when I'm there, and pool tables... 
I've had their wings which are surprisingly good, and sushi is pretty good too."
__label__4	The ladies here are very sweet and price is very reasonable. They have a well supplied snack station and offer free drinks. They are awesome at manicures as well as acrylics.
__label__4	I was surprised I couldn't get points on my loyalty card after using a $1 off coupon! My drink was still $4.35 with the coupon!
__label__4	It's in the lunch rotation.  Typical Philly deli/cheesesteak fare but good quality ingredients.  Last week I had a delicious spinach salad with bacon and it was super good.  They are great for breakfast sandwiches as well.
__label__4	"Proper knows how to do it up Proper the food is delicous, service amazing. Can't wait to try everything on the menu.
There take on sonoran dog, frites with black pepper aioli, burger with bacon aioli. Yummy!"
__label__4	"Party of two went for center city restaurant week 2021   Choice was decent and we liked the food and atmosphere 
Service from host and server was more outstanding than food. Really liked their mannerisms 
Valet parking validation $10 was convenient too 
Restaurant is located in hotel building ,
We had to ask for some access card each time using lady's room 
Overall, it was good experience"
__label__4	"Tried them at the south side farmers market and stopped by their brick and mortar. 
Delicious coffee and great staff!"
__label__4	Loved my first time waxing session at the Naked Peach yesterday! Sarah my therapist yesterday was awesome. She made me relax and was very attentive and helpful in answering my questions. The place is very clean. Highly recommend this place for first timers like me!
__label__4	Some of the best nails I have received...I like powdered organic..,seem very attentive to customers.  Clean than most.  Prices higher but you get what you pay for!
__label__4	As far as brewery tours go, this one is a more about the history of a company than it is about the beer. But I have never had a bad time on the tour. The guides are always very friendly, there is no cost to the tour, and if you happen to go on a day that brewing and bottling aren't happening, you get an extra sample at the end. Who can really complain about free beer and a fun, interactive history lesson?!
__label__4	The wife and I stopped in last Saturday after enjoying the beach. The beer was pretty good. However, I wish they were able to offer samples before having to commit to a full beer.
__label__4	Had very yummy, cheap drinks here when we were visiting a friend, thanks to the Yelp check-in offer.
__label__4	"Great selection of different bubble teas with boba / jelly / tapioca as well as some authentic Japanese soft and yogurt drinks.

Most of drinks come in a pretty large size. Strawberry bubble tea was great and was done quickly. Giving it 4 stars only because it was like $7-8 for a drink..."
__label__4	Pretty decent bar, staff is attentive and extremely nice. Good selection of beers and bar food. Tried the vegetarian hoagie and was surprised at how good it tasted. Prices are reasonable and pretty big inside.
__label__4	Cream cheese icing on top is creamy and not overly sweet. Cupcakes are kind of pricey though, and extremely large! Probably not a good idea to eat 1 in one sitting.
__label__5	My wife and I love this place, not only is the food great, the staff is so friendly and they always have fast service
__label__5	Simple NOLA/Cajun restaurant, of simply outstanding quality. The menu changes daily, and orders can be whole or half and half (a half-portion of two dishes on the same plate. The staff is always friendly, ready to answer questions about the menu helpfully, and samples to help one decide are always free. Personal favorites are the Maque Choux and the black chili. Check them out.
__label__5	This place is my go to! Its a great family owned pizza joint. The pizza is outstanding and the service is friendly and fast. They had a girl that was answering the phones there that was a little rough to deal with but I don't think she is there anymore. If you looking for a great pie from good people this is the place to go.
__label__5	I love Lucy Pop! Super cute salon and very friendly staff. Landy always does an amazing job on my hair! Highly recommended.
__label__5	Yummy spot for breakfast. Try the cinnamon toast and cheesy grits. We go almost every morning on vacation. The staff is super friendly too.
__label__5	My friend and I came here spontaneously one day in the summer looking for some soft serve ice cream; I couldn't be happier we found this place! Friendly staff, amazing soft serve and great prices. I get the twisted soft serve (with chocolate and vanilla ice cream) oreo crunch; I love that they incorporate the oreo's throughout the ice cream rather than just sprinkling some on top. Amazingly creamy ice cream and some of the best in the New Orleans area!
__label__5	Having breakfast with my mom...turned out to be a great visit in part thanks to the owner and friendly staff who did everything to ratify and satisfy a cituation.  Thanks you all.
__label__5	as a Tampa Native it took me FOREVER to try Berns as I thought it was over the moon expensive, yet it was just a high end steak house with VERY Fair pricing for an above average meal.  Would highly recommend.  My only complaint is that its so hard to get a reservation unless its MONTHS in advance.  The wait is long for walk-ins if available, and I would consider eating at the bar.
__label__5	Had an early Saturday morning emergency, main drain was clogged which means all water activity in house has to stop. Saw in reviews that Ken was recommended for emergencies and that response time was typically very fast. He picked up my call immediately and his team was at my door in 30 minutes. They saved our weekend, we are very appreciative, will definitely be calling again!
__label__5	We ordered catering for my daughter's graduation party and it was a huge hit! We got the brisket, smoked wings, potato salad and baked beans...it also came with the sauces and rolls. The portions were large and the food was delicious, everyone at the party loved it. Will definitely order there again! Very reasonably priced as well.
__label__5	"The salad and the pizza are great!  I also
Love the chicken wings without the onions.  The wings are hearty and grilled.   You won be disappointed- get either the wings and pizza or the salad and pizza.  The meatballs are amazing but that is another meal"
__label__5	So very delicious! Got off the plane at the airport and we were starving! The beef and chicken schwarma was wonderful. Great garlic sauce too!
__label__5	The staff here is super friendly and knowledgeable! We have visited many vape shops and is always a let down when we know more than the workers luck for us that's not the case at mystic vape. Excellent selection of both house blend juices and premium juice.  Plus they carry my favorite line, boosted. highly suggest people that are new to vapping check it out they will teach you how to use your equipment properly and to its full potential.
__label__5	Very good Scottish gastro pub in CWE.  Amazing Scotch selection and good amount of beer.  Plenty of traditional Scottish and assorted British fare.  I had the Shepard's pie which was good but not fantastic.  Since I've been in London for quite a while, it was a nice treat and was definitely worth it.  Also they show European football (soccer) and other less popular sports so it may be a good place to watch a game. I don't know because it was Euro 08 Qualifiers when I was there, which means there were exciting matches like Slovenia vs. Albania.
__label__5	Delicious and fresh ingredients. Family restaurant. So quant and warm. Definitely order their Kibbe and also the spinach pie!! Arabic coffee is so authentic and tasty. This is a staple in the neighborhood.
__label__5	I'm a Charleston, SC Native. Carolina boy through and through. Ever since I've moved to the big easy I've been craving a good mustard based pulled pork BBQ. Then I found LA Smokehouse and it was everything I wanted and more. AMAZING amazing food, and at a very reasonable price. My girlfriend and I ate dinner for $25! Can't beat that!
__label__5	Great pizza with enormous slices. Authentic homemade spanakopita is simply delicious. Highly recommend it!
__label__5	"Off the chart Chile rellena. Awesome staff and tequila selection.  Other menu items look great. Good location. Give um a try
Sady would be the bartender of choice."
__label__5	Always one of my favorite chain restaurants. Great selection in meat/ seafood/ veggies and sauces. I would deduct 1/2 a star because they were out of my favorite sauce, khan pao. :/ But after going to Khan's Mongolian Grill downtown, I couldn't take that 1/2 off. Wish that they had a more centralized location... there are only two locations right now - one in Franklin and one in Hendersonville.
__label__5	So good! Ordered tamales for dinner and was pleasantly surprised. Never seen a tamale this loaded with beef before, usually places skimp on that. They were also extremely kind and with the online ordering option I didn't have to do much to eat good food. Will definitely be back.
__label__5	Great food, great prices. Their fried mushrooms and burger are the best. Strongly recommend.
__label__5	I booked this limousine service to take us to the airport for our Walt Disney trip. The driver showed up on time and was very helpful and friendly. On the return, he was there to recieve us and helped us with all of our luggage. We felt like celebrities going and coming. We will recommended T&S Limousines to all of our friends and family.
__label__5	King crab and Cajun seasoning bowl...very good. Then to top off with fried ice cream.
__label__5	From the moment I walked in, I was amazed. The selection of aged meats and fine cheeses blew my mind. I can't wait to go back.
__label__5	Seriously so much fun. The staff is very professional, and every kart runs and handles great. I got the annual membership, which is well worth it, and intend on going as much as I can. Just remember to be courteous and watch out for each other.
__label__5	Lucy's Fire is likely the best taco in the city. Would love to have a beef version. I found this place 3 weeks ago and I've already been 5 times. Margs use fake lime juice which take away from potential.
__label__5	Had a great time at the beautiful Scottish rites building listening to Armen donelian - gorgeous piano playing and the acoustics were incredible.  A lovely 2 hour show with a lovely variety of song choices.  My favorite was his rendition of Sunrise/sunset from Fiddler on the Roof- gave me goose bumps!
__label__5	Very professional and clean. Had full back done and it was relatively painless (as far as waxing goes). Kate did a great job and was kind as well as professional the entire time- not to mention she did a fantastic job! I look forward to future appointments, and possibly getting a membership.
__label__5	We had an after hours emergency. We were lucky enough to have an experienced, courteous, and professional plumber come out. Services rendered after hours are charged a premium, but it was worth it. Our technician, JR was determined to solve our issue despite the rain he encountered while working outside at night. He got us back in business and even dealt with our landlord on the phone to explain all the work he did. Again, we were lucky to get JR, and even though we hope we don't need their services again, we will call on Billy the Sunshine Plumber again.
__label__5	I ate there for Thanksgiving 2018 and had the Best Snow Crab Legs ever will be coming back for more...
__label__5	Jason and crew are knowledgeable, efficient, and most importantly HONEST! I really appreciate them and recommend them to anyone.
__label__5	As a newbie to Cajun food I will say that this place was great. Had the Boudin Ball that were delicious with a little heat. Next was the crab boil. OMG I could really get addicted to this.
__label__5	It's the best the best the best oh the best and bestest cheezsteak cheeeesesteak xheeese steak the best the best oh it's the best eat it love it live it till you can't eat anymore till you die of happiness
__label__5	Best pizza, loved the crust! Tried their new Bavarian pretzels sticks with the cheese all I can say is oh my it was so good. Great server and loved the atmosphere. I would definitely go back again. A small individual pizza and a salad $7.99 great deal
__label__5	Off the beaten path in the Bywater area of New Orleans is some of the best BBQ you'll have. I got the pulled pork & 1/2 chicken. The chicken was great, & the pork was just right. My wife got the brisket sandwich, & I wish I got that! It was amazing! The coleslaw was a nice balance for the smoked meats. The mac & cheese was the only thing that was sub-par, but the meat is the star!
__label__5	I absolutely love this place! It reminds of coffee shops that serve food back on the east coast, very cute and laid back with incredible food. The carnitas were so well seasoned and perfectly cooked, and our drinks were spot on with the flavor. We will be returning soon for the ambiance and food (and I'll be back for more chai lattes!)
__label__5	Kristen, Brad, Brad, Goel, Kaylee, Alex, Rick and all the staff make this restaurant truly a family, fun and living environment!  I am a Sauce loyal and love the food, but have the bonus of seeing such caring and friendly people. Thank you for offering such healthy food choices and excellent ice tea. My favorite is the Quinoa salad with Kale instead of the Arugula. The value is excellent for healthy, fresh food with happy, considerate staff. Well done Sauce on Campbell!
__label__5	UNPRECEDENTED Service! This place is phenomenal! I am recommending this place to all my family and friends! Not only do they have the very best services at the lowest prices, but if your vehicle is not truly in need of service, they will be honest enough to tell you! Shout out to Lisa for her great customer service skills and ability to get you in and serviced Quickly!!!
__label__5	Very friendly and accommodating staff. Great color selection. They give you a massage during your appointment. I also really enjoyed the pedicure experience. I liked the quality of the product they used during the pedicure.
__label__5	Great food even better staff, a must for great food!  I has the blackened Grouper sandwich  with fries FANTASTIC!!!  And the staff was super friendly just the best.  I had a killer desert fried banana pie.
__label__5	Service department: Rich Hood is my guy. We have owned over a dozen GMs ranging from cash-purchased beater trucks to Cadillacs. Right now our 140k mile Suburban is our baby and we want to take care of it. Rich treats our 2011 Suburban like we just bought it from them. (And we didn't, but we will next time). He often under promises on the price he can do then over delivers (on the good side) when we get to the payment counter. We will continue to go back to Rich for our Suburban's long life. Thank you.
__label__5	Love this place!!! The margaritas are awesome!!! The chips and salsa are addictive.....definitely coming back.
__label__5	This place was great! Best Pho I ever had in Reno NV
__label__5	Lori is FANTASITIC!, personable, and confidential, with what she does.  She is outstanding.  She does a superb job with her waxing techniques.  I highly recommend her!!!!  Men and women are treated respectfully and discretely, alike, by her.  I a BIG thumbs up for Lori OConnor.
__label__5	I haven't had Domino's Pizza in a very long time because it's usually never good. Today I was overly excited after receiving my delivery. The pizza was amazing and I felt like I was eating a gourmet pizza! It was hot and arrived completely in tact! Thank you guys at store 5011 for getting it right today!
__label__5	We found this place while visiting Indianapolis and decided to visit the Coca Cola bottle company area! Wow what a great choice! Customer service was fantastic and we enjoyed yummy milkshakes and a banana foster!!! Would highly recommend if you have a sweet tooth!!! High high recommend the banana foster, the person in front of us ordered pie and ice cream and that looked to die for also!
__label__5	This place is awesome. The food was beyond excellent. The atmosphere is cozy and lively. The drinks were excellent. Even on the first Friday of being opened, they were quick! Tater, one of the servers was great!
__label__5	So glad this space is open! Had an amazing experience, from the food to all the kind employees. I've been a couple of times, but my favorite meal so far has definitely been the sweet porridge with a poached egg on top. Seriously so good! I also got the Atlas coffee, it was delicious and so unique! I will definitely be frequenting!
__label__5	"This is our favorite sushi restaurant ever. We try to make it here as often as possible, even though it's a good 30 min. drive from our house. We have tried many of the special rolls, the Fantastic Roll is our absolute favorite! 

The service is excellent, the owner is very sweet and personable - always remembers our names and welcomes us warmly. And the waitresses decorate the plates with the most beautiful ""plate art.""

If you love fresh sushi - don't miss Fusion Asian!"
__label__5	"The fresh ginger is very reasonable here! This family owned business is helpful and friendly! 
I love the cold pressed  olive oil here!  One of west county best kept secret on everything fresh and authentic! Fresh dry ginger, cinnamon, cinnamon bark and more! Stocking up for the winter!"
__label__5	Had a great experience at the Liter House. Delicious meal and hearty bloody! Was a unplanned stop on the way to the winter market located in the same location. The service was exceptional and the menu interesting. They use local ingredients and from the menu support local most of the time.
__label__5	Buffalo chicken cheesesteak was delicious. They certainly don't skimp on the Buffalo sauce. That bad boy was drenched. Amazing
__label__5	Based on what we had, I was very delighted. We ordered the Nutella, banana, walnut crepe, with ice cream and drizzled chocolate. Every single bite was decadent. The crepe was cooked just right and the sweetness of the toppings was not like some desserts that are just to rich to really enjoy. We also had a delicious cappuccino. My husband and I really enjoyed this little Ybor gem.
__label__5	Adorable and modern sweet shop with many options to hit that sweet tooth craving.  In search of some macarons, YELP didn't steer me wrong. The shop was clean, the service was helpful (especially because I don't like dark/milk chocolate) and my selections were moderately priced! I chose 3 macarons of Strawberry, pumpkin pie and apple pie. Should I visit Magazine street again, I'll stop and and check out their delicious seasonal flavors!
__label__5	Just went through the appetizers and they were just great! If you've never tried alligator this is where you should have it first. The oysters and the shrimps are a good complement to get you through the night
__label__5	The best fried chicken ever!!!!!! No wonder they are so famous and the sides were DELICIOUS! Don't pass on the red potato skin salad. The  fries  were crispy until we got home 30 minutes away.
__label__5	This place is really coming along! Got some groceries done and noticed that that cafe is now open! After shopping, say down and had some food and is delish! Great flavors with fresh ingredients. Def coming back again! Looking forward on trying the other dishes next time. Friendly staff too.
__label__5	Fat Salmon literally never disappoints. If I want good, affordable sushi...this is the go-to. Table for one or table for 10, the service is always on point, and the quality of fish is just...superb. The super white tuna is melt in your mouth delicious & the Old School roll is amazing (not for the faint of heart, this stuff is SPICY.) So many good memories here and most importantly, so many fantastic meals. I luv Fat Salmon.
__label__5	Had this for the first time when I was down in Tucson for business. I have had just about every concoction you can make with a hot dog but the Sonoran Hotdog is truly the most tasty and fun one I have ever had. I was also very happy with the facility. Very clean and very quick with the order. I will definitely be back whenever I am in town again!
__label__5	This bread is well known amongst the foodies here in Tucson. It lives up to its reputation! By far the best bread in Arizona!
__label__5	This is the one of the best Thai places in Indy I come here all the time and I love the yellow curry!
__label__5	Food and service was excellent! This was nice after our experience last night at a another local place. We will be back.  The view is fantastic!
__label__5	Amazing atmosphere, amazing food! the brunch menu is my favorite. The owners make everyone feel like family. This place is a parish gem. Don't be afraid to come try! Vegan options as well.
__label__5	Outstanding Shepherd's Pie and Hummus! Love the feel & atmosphere of this pub. Very friendly staff and live music!
__label__5	First time coming here, food is fresh and you can see into the kitchen and see what's cookin. Cannolis here are decent but aren't worth the price shown. Pizza is tasty as well and definitely made with love.
__label__5	"Let me explain one thing and then I will get into the other stuff...

.Chickie and Pete's cheese sauce for sale....

That gets five stars alone. but really, this is a bright supermarket with an abundance of almost everything you will ever need. They really have a great selection of fruits and veggies and even a lot of organic stuff. 
They re did the Cheltenham Shoprite so it is pretty much the same as far as the Chinese buffet and those things."
__label__5	Great food! Great service. I'm glad to have stumbled upon this hidden gem in downtown Tampa!
__label__5	Holy Sh&% this place is awesome. I felt like I was in Franco's living room with his family and neighbors sitting around us. Excellent authentic Italian hybrid cuisine with reasonable prices. BYOB to boot. Love this spot. Total sleeper smash hit!
__label__5	Always awesome dining and superlative service,   Bria is a go to for us any night.  We love  it every time.
__label__5	"I LOVED this place! The ice cream here was very very good. Staff was super friendly..I tried almost every flavor haha..but they were so sweet.

The flavors were so SHARP and unique. The kind of flavors you'd see on the Food Network challenge shows (I.E : coconut & basil) You could totally tell that this ice cream was quality and a lot of thought went into producing it. I didn't try the pastries but they also looked equally good and quality. 

Even though the quantity seemed really small since we ordered 2 small sized portions it was still satisfying and plenty."
__label__5	Love this family-run restaurant!  The charming duo of mother and daughter is chef and waitstaff.  I ordered the tamal azteca and chocolate oaxaca, and the portions are huge!  The tamal was delicious-- the salsa was amazing.  I'm normally not a fan of rice and beans, but these were delicious.
__label__5	Great happy hour (our bill for 2 was under $40 before tip)! I recommend the crunchy bagel roll and the shrimp tempura roll. If you love coconut, order the Pink Geisha cocktail, eh, go ahead and order two!
__label__5	My favorite place to get gyros. Well cooked with a nice sauce. Their pita bread is amazing. Very airy. I've had their hummus and babaganoush. Both are delicious. The atmosphere is very laid back. I have gone to Marhaba many times and have never had a bad experience. Highly recommend this place!
__label__5	I loved the food, decor, and atmosphere here. We came late on a Monday night, so it was pretty empty, but we were all happy with our wines and our light food selections. The service was good too. I'd love to come back on a future visit to Saint Louis.
__label__5	Piece of cake to get in and out of. Simple layout, two concourses and they're clearly marked. You can't get lost in this place. The folks I dealt with in the gift shop were so friendly! Big change of pace from larger airports where the gift shop staff hates their job.
__label__5	Holy crap,  what an amazing meal.  Put a fork in me I'm done. Prime rib spectacular., melts in you mouth  and a great deal,  two people less than $100.00. Can't wait to come come back.
__label__5	This was my first visit at Urban Allure and it exceeded all of my expectations! I had Morgan as a stylist and she is so wonderful and honest with her clients. I wasn't exactly sure what I wanted done and she guided me through her opinions. I love what she did to my hair!! She's the best, go to her!
__label__5	Best burger on NS Indy, and their pepperoni pizzas are GREAT.  My sister loves the strawberry salad.  Almost always good, attentive service (refills on drinks are prompt.)  Our food arrived in about 8 minutes, so I can't complain.  After all, it is a big burger and they had to cook it and dress it.
__label__5	Great fried chicken. I grew up on this stuff, and it is the best fried chicken in Delaware. Great hot, but get some extra to eat the next day cold, its just as good.
__label__5	Great location, great food and cocktails. Staff is extremely friendly. Can't beat the views.
__label__5	"This place is fantastically classy. Rather than seven TVs showing Opera, this place plays clasical music. Manicures and pedicures come with hot stone massages. It's a great place to go to relax - it's quiet, calm, and very nice. $12 for a manicure, $30 for a pedi - but the massage is wonderful and totally worth it. They have discounts Mon - Wed on various things.

There's no parking, but when school is out you can park in the lot across the street."
__label__5	"Imagine investing 30 min, to get a little box of 6 mini donuts and after your first bite thinking, ""Are you kidding me how good these are???"" SO worth the wait! I had chocolate donut w/vanilla buttercream icing and vanilla glazed. Both were the kind of taste pleasure that makes you wanna savor and smile! Can't wait to try the gluten free next time!"
__label__5	"This new restaurant is a wonderful addition to the neighborhood (open for 6 weeks, as of this review). Authentic, refined recipes, with fresh ingredients. The service is also first rate. The attention to detail really shows.

I look forward to coming back."
__label__5	Kelsey was AH-Mazing! I had gone to another salon and they basically did the exact opposite of what I wanted. Kelsey fixed my hair and made me look wonderful! I will be going back to her in a couple weeks to get my color done.
__label__5	Dr. Wolfe-Gasche and her Audiology staff treat each patient with the utmost respect, discuss the short and long term effects of hearing loss, then introduce and demonstrate the recommended hearing aid technology to assist each specific hearing loss.
__label__5	Dr. Hollander is the most caring, patient and gentle dentist I've ever seen. I've been under his care for over 2 years now and can't imagine seeing another dentist. I used to be afraid of dental work, but Dr. Hollander made me feel very comfortable and relaxed. And thanks to his hard work, my teeth are now the healthiest, and in the best shape they have ever been in.
__label__5	"Clean, accessible paths, manicured lawns, appealing landscape, room to roam, near eateries and pubs, pet friendly, and it's in the middle of the Biggest Little City in the World.

Thank you City of Reno. You should be proud of this little park. Gay Pride Day will be filling the place this weekend (8/15/15), and I'm wishing I could be here to see the goings on.

When I visited today, it was on the quiet side, and it appears to be a favorite among locals and very well used. Kudos, again Reno!"
__label__5	"A taste of Puerto Rico in Lutz! OMG! Don't be fooled at the location. Behind a gas station. It's like being in Puerto Rico. 

The food is delicious. The place is clean, friendly and the food to die for. Only about 10 tables. The place is cozy with a great little atmospheres 

If you want real good Puerto Rican food, that tastes like your grandmother made, it run to this place in of all places Lutz!"
__label__5	"Friendly staff and well stocked store. I couldn't find any beauty in here, but there are lots of supplies to help you BECOME beautiful!

I think they should be called a beauty AID supply. They have tons of different colors for your hair, and all the stuff to mix together to make those colors stay in your hair. Of course, you have to have hair to  color or else it gets a little weird! Prices seem fair, though I haven't shopped anywhere else. Great place for this part of town."
__label__5	Finally was able to make to the restaurant. It was so so good.Its a tiny little place and full of Chicago nostalgia, Bears wallpaper in the bathroom(go Bears!). All kinds of pictures all over the walls such as Chicago album covers and a picture of Bozo the clown!! The food was fantastic. The lunch special with wings and slice of stuffed pizza was amazing.The wings has great flavor and you can't go wrong with stuffed pizza. We will be back as they have so many things on the menu I want to come back and try ( gotta try that Italian beef!!)
__label__5	"Just discovered this place by accident after a doctor's appointment.
Friendly staff behind the counter greeted me. I picked a lamb Gyros ( by the way if you ever go to Greece don't call it Euro, that's a currency, it's pronounced Gūros). I also ordered Tzaziki with warm pita bread as takeout. Both dishes were excellent. Portions are nice, enough for 2 to share.
I'll come back and try more."
__label__5	Amazingly delicious western omelette.  Pretty presentation.  Clean surroundings. Attentive service.  Such a gem.
__label__5	Wow! I am still in awe of this place! This was my first visit! I ordered the goat cheese red cherry ice cream! It was heavenly! Great balance of tart and sweetness!
__label__5	I love this place!  Lots of fitness classes, swimming and open gym. It is unpretentious compared to other gyms in the area. It is a beautiful, clean facility that appeals to families. There's a very nice outdoor water park with slides, lazy river, simulated surfing area. A park surrounds it with trails and a very nice splash park and playground for little ones. You can purchase a monthly pass or pay by the day. We're lucky and access is part of our Lilly benefits. We can also go to LA Fitness but I much prefer this center.
__label__5	Brooklyn's pizza company is probably one of my top favorite spots to eat at. The pizza is yummy and the bread sticks are bomb!!! The service is great, very friendly. I would recommend everyone to go there I love it sooo much!
__label__5	I visit and shop in a lot of grocery stores and this store is one of the best grocery stores ever. The Resturant offerings (fire grilled chicken, sticky ribs, sushi, giant sized Hoagie bar, etc) are fantastic. The organic selection is great and the store has a great selection of beer and wine!
__label__5	"Amazing food!  Every bite explodes in your mouth with a burst of flavor!

The oysters are to die for and the blackened red fish was amazing.  The bread soufflé with whiskey sauce was to die for as well as their signature shot at the end of the meal!

This is an amazing place that the locals love.  You can go to the spots where the tourists go or you can go where the people who live here frequent.

I know what choice I made-you should too!"
__label__5	"John.

I have used this company many times.   They have always been fair, and professional.
Prices are fair."
__label__5	One of the best burgers I have ever had. Seasoned and cooked perfectly, the fries are pretty good too. They have their own sauces you can put on your burger or dip your fries in, all of them are delicious. They have hand crafted soda's and a very modern look and feel to them.  I was impressed, I wasn't expecting it to be as good as it was. I've already taken some friends here and they loved it too. Keep up the good work guys, your doing an awesome job!
__label__5	So this used to be an outdated ABC pizza but now it's a great all-day breakfast diner now. Completely remodeled and cozy diner with dog friendly outdoor patio and tables. We were treated to a round of drinks from the owner who came over to check on everything while we were eating. Fairly priced and good food! Breakfast here is my favorite.
__label__5	2nd visit:  prix fixe menu winter-  5 star food, 5 star service.  Can't wait to try next seasons menu!  Thanks
__label__5	Update - My most recent experience in Saigon Blonde. As a customer I was embraced with a heartfelt warm welcome and a grateful attitude from management.  This place has one of the most original decors in all of Down Town St Petersburg.  The bar ambiance oozes an air of total relaxation, music and service. Complimented with an amazing selection of cocktails that can be enhanced with CBD.  Great for group gathering, if on a date nestle in a comfortable cozy romantic couch. A must stop place when visiting Down Town St Petersburg.
__label__5	We have been eating here for years. The food is fresh and delicious. The service is great. The new space is really beautiful.  You can dine indoors or out on the deck, weather permitting. Highly recommended!!
__label__5	I ordered a plain pizza from Angelos. All of the ingredients tasted very fresh and the pizza was amazing. I just wish the ordering and pickup process was a little more convenient.
__label__5	It was our first time to Robert's. The server was great! It was my birthday that day and she went out of her way for me. The music was good and the service was on point. It wasn't as busy as some of the other bars on broadway but it was by far our favorite bar.

__label__5	Great food. Something I would expect in tampa area. Surprisingly good quality and good price. Not bad zephyrhills!
__label__5	Had diner here last night it was as good as Morton's or Flemmings my filet wrapped in bacon with crab and sweet corn risotto was banging. Great job!
__label__5	I LOVE this place! It is always spotless clean and the staff is always very nice and make u feel ur part of a family. I will never do my laundry anywhere else! Plus the fact u can pay using ur phone is so easy, and helpful when u run out of quarters or just dont have any to use. This is the top dog of laundry mats! Good work! Thank u for giving us a safe, clean, friendly environment to do laundry in.
__label__5	Best meal on Clearwater Beach!  Chips and guacamole were standard but the tacos were outstanding. We tried the Cuban, Shorty and Vegetal and devoured every last morsel. The tables outside are under a large tree but the scenery is basically the parking lot.  This was a short walk from Opal Sands - wish we would've come here on the first night instead of the last.
__label__5	Had a pepperoni pizza to go last night. Best pizza I've had in this area in years. This will be Trudy's and my pizza place from now on, in addition to our regular Italian restaurant.  Staff always well attending and friendly. Mario always greets with a big hello. Good people.
__label__5	Food and coffee is great! I wish the didn't close early. They let you customize your meals and cater to food allergies! I wish they were open 24/7! Get the power scramble! Cute brunch and healthy eats
__label__5	There are some good groomers around, but none can compete with this place! Have been taking my pets there for several months and never disappointed. I have been to a lot of dog/cat groomers over the years, but this is the BEST! Caring employees give your pet the VIP treatment, treat them like your children.  Reasonable prices, friendly, happy atmosphere. We always leave with smiles on our faces. (critters included) Conveniently located and accommodating attitudes.
__label__5	I am a fairly new patient but my experience has been great with Dr. Liu and his staff. I usually go on my lunch hour and they are always efficient!
__label__5	"Wow what a nice flavorful find in Nashville.  Very basic and tasty.  This reminded me of my California roots.   I assume the origin was California as they have a flag hanging. 

What I liked best was the carne asada burrito.   Meet only.  No filling of beans and rice.  Now I know that this place is authentic.  Salsa on tables are spicy.  

Will be back.  Not whiteman Mexican but a place where a Mexican would and could eat."
__label__5	Scarlett Begonias is sooo good! Cinnamon Rolls, biscuits  & pretzels all awesome.  Salmon bagel was one the best I've had.  Good coffee, good pancakes for kids, it's all good folks!
__label__5	After working hard in the yard I need an elk or an ostrich burger from Fudds !! I love the healthier buns and the yummy fries. My little likes the chicken strips and the complementary cookie. Their is a new style Coca-cola Machine that can make literally any kind of soda you can imagine. There is Nevada decor and large tvs to watch as well. Their specialty burgers are my absolute favorite!
__label__5	Brandon W. and André K were fantastic! So nice and professional and quick! Overall super happy with the service I received. Had literally no issues and everything was done safe and promptly
__label__5	The best Cuban sandwiches ever! Since I ate their Cuban sandwiches I never want to eat any others. I totally understand why they can run their business more than 100 years in Ybor city.
__label__5	I'm shocked to find such a delicious soul food restaurant right here in Indy. I've been back twice in the last 2 weeks. The service is great and the food is outstanding. This place is a smaller restaurant so it got pretty busy during both visits but they get you seated very quickly.
__label__5	I took my car to Midas after getting a windshield wiper promotion in the mail. In addition to getting my oil changed and the promotion windshield wipers, the mechanics discovered a dirty air filter (engine). I am highly satisfied with the service done to my car and level of professionalism displayed at this location by Winton and the manager on site. I had a chance to speak with both of them regarding my car. I will be back to this location in the future. Excellent customer service goes a long way and I appreciate the courtesy, especially during this pandemic. Highly recommended, 5 star experience.
__label__5	Sunflower market is certainly a welcome change from some of the more commercialized big box grocers.  Unique finds, good prices and good service.  There should be more in town!
__label__5	"Wonderful place for our daughter's wedding weekend.  We held the rehearsal dinner out back by the pool, it was beautiful 
and lots of fun.  All the family members stayed here so we had the BnB to ourselves.  Bill and Wilder were great to work with, very accommodating and helpful in every way. 
The rooms are very comfortable, immaculately clean and have everything you could need.  Breakfast was a treat each morning and there are tons of restaurants close by for lunch and dinner.  
We highly recommend the Water Garden Inn and want to thank them for making our special weekend a great success!"
__label__5	I don't see where the bad reviews about the broth are coming from. I've gotten ramen here probably 6 times (always the signature tonkotsu) and have always enjoyed it. I think it's delicious and rich, it's my favorite part of the ramen.
__label__5	Saw that the store is under new management and decided to give it a try. I was greeted from the start by Jose who was very knowledgeable and helped me get my right size and price matched it for me also!
__label__5	Food is the best...glad I found it before I moved......but the little girl with the bad attitude that works taking orders really should get another job or learn how to deal with customers. Stop stomping into the kitchen to ask what is in a dish......family member or not, grow up!  Not the best for the business.  I made my displeasure known several times to her, but Brat was still there the last time I ordered. Never had the time to ask for a grown-up to come out and speak with me...
__label__5	I would give them 6 stars if I could! When you see a line out the door, you know why! I loveeeee their breakfast and po-boys! Drooling just thinking about it.
__label__5	This is probably the best seafood I've tasted in a long time. We walked in and it was empty and the staff was getting ready for the day. We were greeted by the hostess, who was really friendly. Upon sitting down the waiter (Rick) explained the menu to us, since it was our first time at their restaurant. He provided us with an explanation on how fresh their seafood was and guided us to their restaurant favorites. Words can't explain on how delicious the food was and how fresh it was!!!! Great service and food!!!!!!!!
__label__5	love going to this location! staff is so kind and helpful, store is very organized and clean, will definitely be going to only this location from now on.
__label__5	Mica is very caring and sends me pics of my precious feline while I am away.  Responsible, loving and trustworthy.  Great combination.
__label__5	This place doesn't look like much but their food is really really good.  Stopped in for a lunch while traveling through Indianapolis and I was not disappointed.  The lunch fajitas were huge and my wife got a lunch enchiladas, both dishes looked like dinner portions.
__label__5	"Food was Great!  Delicious Gumbo, salad and burger! 

Also. this was great service! Thank you"
__label__5	Fabulous and hassle-free experience with my car repair at Touch N Go. Chris is extremely knowledgeable and cares about his customers, as well as ensuring that the repair is good quality while not overcharging. The estimate he gave me was exactly what the ending price was (to the cent), hours were convenient (he often stays much later than what the hours listed online are), and my car was repaired, washed, and cleaned on the inside in half the time he had originally estimated. Highly recommended!
__label__5	I am using Chuck's garage for all my cars since year. This is the best quality and very honest shop around and services import cars too. I bring my Porsche and BMW there and been happy customer. If you live or work close they even drive you there, highly recommend this awesome shop.
__label__5	This is the sushi in town. I used to live two blocks from here and would dine 2-3 times a week.
__label__5	Atmosphere is nice. The waiter was social and very funny. The drinks were great.  Had the barbequed shrimp and it was delicious.
__label__5	Wow wow what a great lunch ,Great  food, byo,chairs confortable,very friendly only bad parking need to pay Cross street or make sure have plenty changes. I'll put the menu later Iam eating :)) with a paradox winery wine . Good job chef ohh kind Mediterranean food mix American and some Mexican great combo .
__label__5	My favorite go to #2 drink its the perf mix of coffee and milk tea flavors with out it being too sweet. Be careful because once you order one you wanna keep coming back for more that drink is so addicting!
__label__5	"Great pizza and restaurant.  Friendly Staff, especially George.  Love the new look and the food is always superb!

Best,
Bob Plaut & Family."
__label__5	Very good family restaurant for breakfast and lunch. Excellent service and food. Breakfast omelets are large and delicious. A very good amount of food for the money. A great value!
__label__5	The service from this entire family was super polite. We had breakfast... I must say I've had juevos rancheros at many restaurants over the years, and it's such a simple dish, but this was the best I have ever had. Very cozy inside, clean. Will be sure to bring out of towners any time we have them. This is truly a treasure hidden in the east side.
__label__5	Great food and salsa bar. They definitely do not wimp down their hot sauces. The avocado salsa is the mildest aside from the pico de gallo. I had the mahi-mahi dish and it was cooked with love! The burrito Mojado is also very good!
__label__5	We have taken our cars to Jim's for many years now.  THE most honest mechanic you will ever find.  We've had window tinting on three cars, all of which were perfection.  We also get our cars detailed here annually.  Impeccable!  Staff is very friendly and helpful in all locations.  I would never dream of taking my car anywhere other than Jim's for any of these services.
__label__5	I took my fifth wheel to Camping World to be consigned. I called first and went through the process with Mindy. She is the consignment specialist. She was absolutely wonderful! From the time we dropped it off until the time we picked up the check she did all the work and made the process so easy. I would highly recommend working with Mindy and Camping World. They got me a fair price and I wouldn't hesitate to go through it again. Thank you again Mindy!
__label__5	This a great little lunch spot tucked away in old city next to the customs house. I love the variety of wraps, although the #21 spicy chicken with fresh mozzarella is probably my favorite and the fries are delicious. Traditional to Belgian frites they have a bunch of different sauces you can get on the side with your fries. All in all a solid lunch spot that is quick and delicious!
__label__5	This review is specifically for their fruit shakes. Made with love and fresh fruit, they are my favorite shakes in Chinatown. Get the honeydew with bubbles. I've also had her homemade yogurt, which is delicious.
__label__5	"Wonderful. I know enough about cars to know when I'm being taken for a ride. 

The whole experience from start to finish was sincere. 

Thank you for your trustworthiness and quality service."
__label__5	"We waited about 40 mins to be seated (12 noon on a Sunday), but the servers were so friendly, food came out quickly, and everything was delicious. 
The stuffed french toast is epic. The Mexi scramble was great too, but had a bit too many onions in my opinion. Mexi scramble came with black bean grits which were really unique and yummy. Top it off with fresh squeezed orange juice and we were set. 
The seating was lovely too. We sat out on the enclosed porch with big windows and a nice view. A little pricey, but the portions were enormous."
__label__5	Absolutely the best fried chicken I have ever had. My only regret is that I only got to eat here once during my trip. The chicken was juicy and not greasy and all the sides were delicious. Make sure you get a roll and a corn muffin. I want to come back to New Orleans just to eat here.
__label__5	4 of us went for dinner on Thursday evening.  What an incredible menu!  Not the usual items found on most Indian restaurant menus.  We shared 4 small plates and 2 entrees.  The lamb was luscious!  The green bean entrée was fantastic.  We also had the rabbit stuffed naan, wow, to die for!  We tried both shrub beverages, both were delicious.
__label__5	My all-time favorite motorcycle destination! Best buffalo burger I've ever had - goes great with the giant onion rings! Very unique place to visit!
__label__5	Great place. Nice seating. Good crowd. Love the staff here. Like their veggie breakfast sandwich. Very nice coffee too.
__label__5	If you want great food and have the time - this is the place to go! The service is friendly and the food is wonderful, but the cook makes everything fresh so the wait can be really lengthy. Let me tell you though if you want the best onion rings, french fries, or potato pancakes you have ever eaten then it is worth the wait! They also have an amazing french toast breakfast that is so much food it is hard to eat all of it, and it cost right around $5. Unbelievable!
__label__5	BEST FRIED CHICKEN, EVER! I got the two piece fried chicken with mash potatoes and potato salad and it was incredible. The Cajun burger was also delicious! Also, the staff was super helpful and kind-- just an all around great experience!
__label__5	Mike's pizza is excellent. The wings are really good but my most favorite item from Mike's is their Chicken Parm. with spaghetti. They give you two good size chicken breast, not patties. The portion is so generous that I have never finished it in one sitting. They have great garlic bread and their salad has always been fresh. What ever you order, you will be happy with.  I also love the train that runs around the ceiling.
__label__5	"This is a man's barber shop.  The owner is a young local guy who is very friendly and all about customer service. They have a kegirator in the shop and serve free beer while you wait for your haircut.

Awesome price and service. Took me awhile to find this place but finally did after a year of trying different barbers in the St. Pete area.

I highly recommend to anyone looking for a good haircut at a good price!"
__label__5	"Really Really Really Good! 

I've lived in SB for 20 years and this is one of the best restaurants to hit town in a long time. They have really nailed the pulse of what people in SB yearn for with a restaurant. Ambience, character, service, great food are a few of the attributes that make this such the bustling hub that it has become.
I will be a repeat customer of the Lark and will be telling my friends and clients about this spot, also super easy to make a reservation on 'Open Table""
Good Luck Lark...!"
__label__5	"My first trip to Fort Edmonton Park was definitely not a let down. The quaint area around Capitol Theatre, and the greater Park, looks great, especially in the winter. 

The theatre itself is very nice, smaller than I expected, but that only lends itself to an even better atmosphere. It's cozy, which is a good word for the entire area. 

We saw a live radio broadcast of It's a Wonderful Life and enjoyed every second of it! Definitely recommended."
__label__5	Place is awesome. Found it for the bf. Great atmosphere for men with professional stylist
__label__5	"Loves this place! Started with a wonderful Margarita and The dip duo!  Both were so good! Then we enjoyed The chicken sandwich and the Kale salad.
Will be back for sure!"
__label__5	New to the area, found dawn at lash lounge... she is amazing!!  Knows all the product lines and what works, I have sensitivity to glue, she has one that works perfectly! Great prices n fast! Love it!!
__label__5	"Very fresh and tasty burgers ,
Best place in Indianapolis this burger joint brings a taste of Cali style burgers I recommend everyone to try it ."
__label__5	This place was a great find for my wife and I who were visiting from out of town. The bbq shrimp with mole was amazing. They have a good selection of local drafts as well. Can take the St Charles streetcar from canal area which takes you right in front of the restaurant.
__label__5	Hands down the best Biryani I have ever tasted in the US. We ordered the chicken biryani. 2 plates for 3 people and we never thought that we would be able to finish the food but we crushed it. Apart from the fact that we had ordered chicken chilly and chicken 65 for starters also. The food all over was really top notch. May be they could do with some fancy decor but considering the food that they serve, its worth it.
__label__5	Just found this place by accident and it's fabulous! Awesome vibe, cozy atmosphere, check out the rad bathrooms--chalkboard walls with cool quotes on them! Open early AND late. Love the place! Just found my new favorite hangout.  Did I mention the free the free Wifi?!?
__label__5	I came to Artiva to get a trim and am very happy with the results. She was very attentive to what I wanted. Great value- only $10 for the cut.
__label__5	Quick service and rolls were fresh. Tried K-Love and Ceviche specialty rolls and each were packed right with explosive flavors.
__label__5	Best Indian we've had in the area. Senior Management had a grilled tandoor meat appetizer and lamb korma. Totally wonderful. I had onion fritters and paneer tika masala. Fritters fried to perfection. Not greasy or heavy like the ones I have had in other places. Paneer tika masala top notch. We had a rich, heavenly rice pudding for dessert. One note. The service is not slow. It's you meal being individually prepared fresh. No short cuts in their kitchen. Nothing done ahead of time and reheated.
__label__5	Best little airport in the biggest little city in the world! Easy to get in and out of this is truly a no hassle airport a gateway to the world. Good connections to nearby major international airports makes this Reno INTERNATIONAL a real gem. Love the Burning Man display. And other art in their art room on the main concourse.
__label__5	"ok to those who gave a bad review,,,,, you're spoiled
come to the midwest and see what they give us

This is the best ""mexican"" I have ever had, and the best meal I had in New Orleans

GREAT PLACE"
__label__5	"Mainly just reviewing the food here since I found it to be so unexpectedly good. 

I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich with fries on the side - both were very good. Definitely on my list of places to grab a quick and tasty bite."
__label__5	Rob Zinnsmiester and the entire Kieffer's staff has given my customers knowledgeable and friendly assistance for many years.  Their pricing is great and they carry every appliance available.  Great Showroom too.
__label__5	"Been here too many times to count... and I moved here 1 year ago (almost exactly).
Highly recommended! Fair prices, delicious flavors and friendly service."
__label__5	"Brought my parents for their first experience with Pho and Vietnamese food. They loved it!  The flavors were perfect and a nice change to our usually dinner options

We had:
- phi special pho
- chicken fried rice
- meatball pho
- chicken vermicelli
- vegetable spring roll

Even my picky one year old son loved the spring rolls and fried rice!"
__label__5	One of my favorite food trucks in Tucson. I love every version of their fries and their buffaracha wings. I have yet to have anything bad from Big Bad Wolf.
__label__5	I had a great and easy time booking a private van for our roundtrip commute from Philly to JFK. The drivers were kind, helpful and on-time. I will be sure to use them again in the future!
__label__5	Came here with friends on a Saturday night a few weeks ago. Our waiter Wes was awesome and we had a great time! They offer indoor and outdoor dining, they have great food, and they are very good about COVID restrictions (social distanced tables, sanitizing tables, QR Code menus!)
__label__5	great place for discount furniture! they helped me through a tough financial spot! i was able to get furniture for only $50!
__label__5	Love this place!  Such a great value and a very cool place for drinks.  Ask for the jambalaya wrap (no longer on the menu, but can still get it) - it's my favorite in NOLA!
__label__5	I love Dr. Leal and her assistant Sherry!!  They are absolutely terrific.  I could not be more happier with this Dental Office.  I moved to Tampa 4 years ago and was driving back to Orlando to see my old Dentist but now I'm extremely happy I made the move to Tampa Dental Wellness!!  You will be love this office for yourself and your kids.  My children go here as well.
__label__5	We have used all of the larger nurseries in Tucson over the last 3 years and have found that Civano is the best.  Their plants are healthy and last as long as you take care of them.  The staff is knowledgeable and friendly and always have the answer.  We even had them move fruit trees,  and potted plants across town to a new house we bought, flawless and very reasonably priced.   Don't waste your time anywhere else.
__label__5	This small unassuming place is the perfect little restaurant for a dinner with friends. It is pricy but well worth it! Amazing staff and great food. Will be back for the spring menu for sure!
__label__5	the best resturant i have ever eaten!!!!!! the food is amazing!!! The place is very nice and clean!!! The people are extremely nice. i love it
__label__5	"Last visit I never tried the cheesesteak and I'm very pleased to say it was excellent.Packed with meat very flavorful and well seasoned.
I added pepperoni, fried onions, provolone and mozzarella cheese and it had ample amounts of all.The roll was very soft and fresh and it held all the meat together as well as the juices were contained.
I couldn't just get a cheesesteak without trying a pizza slice. The slices are giant, very tasty even when reheated and the staff here is very friendly. Kudos."
__label__5	Went there just to hit the bar for a little bit, had amazing service and great drinks. If you're at Ruth's Chris and you're at the bar, you better hope you get Michelle, she's on point
__label__5	Large portion sizes and good seafood. The lobster roll was a winner, we enjoyed the cajun fish tacos,   and the grouper sandwich was huge and delicious. Worth a stop if you want to eat on the Boardwalk at John's Pass!
__label__5	Had an amazing wedding here this last weekend. Cameron is so awesome, and so helpful and made sure everything went as planned. We can't thank him and the rest of his staff enough for all that they did. The venue is so beautiful and well worth the money we spent. If we had to do it all again, we wouldn't change a thing.
__label__5	I was originally referred to MCM as an alternative to my Audi dealer.  Scott and his team are highly recommended.  I have found them to be knowledgeable, honest & reliable.  Don't waste your time & money at your dealer.  Take your car to MCM!
__label__5	Amazing breakfast! Enjoyed the bacon, avocado Benedict, and let me tell you it was pure heaven with a side of home potatoes that were perfect. The staff was very attentive and made sure we felt welcome. We will be back.
__label__5	"Great food every time I visit!

Went in today for a quick to-go lunch. The bar tender, Anthony, was hilarious and gave prompt service. I was in and out in about 5 minutes. (I did just get a side and shake.) Great service every time i've been there, and the food is great and not too expensive."
__label__5	Had to stay here last night due to a property issue at my apartment which is right up the street. The man at the front desk who helped us check in was extremely kind and understanding of the stress we were under and the problem we were dealing with and accommodated to our needs immediately. Certainly one of the best experiences I've had yet at a hotel in the area!
__label__5	First time here. Great atmosphere, Poutine was great and our server Chloe was awesome! We'll be back soon!
__label__5	"I love the Mekong. Maybe the most under-rated restaurant on South Grand, if not the whole city. It's cheap, friendly and good. 
Let the tourists from the county pack Pho Grand. I'll slide into a comfy booth at the place up the street."
__label__5	"One of my favorite places in Tampa. It's my go-to place to take out-of-towners. Great beer selection and super-creative cocktails (""spa water"" is the best - cucumber vodka & cucumber soda = so refreshing & perfect for summer.) The homemade chips with blue cheese sauce are awesome. Just went there for brunch the other day and was blown away by the chicken & waffles... Eggs Benedict with fried chicken tenders on a cheddar cheese belgian waffle. I pretty much died and went to heaven."
__label__5	Best Mexican food in Tucson.  Menudo and Shrimp Ceviche is no Joke!!  Salsa and Beans Very good. They serve a green enchilada that is unreal.  Whenever in town it's a must.  The service is way off the charts....
__label__5	Best bar ever!!!! Great food and even better bartenders!!!! Not one bad thing to say!
__label__5	Best Italian food in Boise! The location & building are deceiving, but once you are sat at a table you'll know you're in for something special.  Great wine list. We've never been disappointed with anything. Wait staff is well trained and attentive. The only down side is the small bar/waiting area which they've tried to mitigate with a yurt but, well it's a yurt w/folding chairs also, no reservations. But you can call ahead.
__label__5	This is one of the best Brick and Mortar Sporting Goods shops you'll find. Ammo during the shortage? They've got it! A wide selection of every type of firearm you could want? They're chock full of em! Plus, you'll have the friendliest customer service around regardless of who assists you! If you're a first time buyer, these folks will happily walk you through the entire process from choosing what firearm fits you needs and budget, to completion of the necessary paperwork. Check them out
__label__5	This has been one of my favorite things 30 years! The food is amazing, and the people have always been great. We come every time we are in town!
__label__5	Terrific food! Fresh, innovative, and great flavors! Top notch! But I think the biggest thing to brag about with this restaurant (at both branches) is the exceptional customer service they provide, consistently, EVERY time I go here!!! They really value their customers--and it shows in their food and their service!! They are especially careful with any food allergies you might have. Love this place!
__label__5	I stopped for a quick lunch and it was amazing! My server was a very kind man and he was very attentive. I had the Mongolian beef lunch special and had enough for a Togo box. Very nice atmosphere and people and delicious food.
__label__5	"Love nails is over the top! amazing. Modern, clean, professional! I was fortunate enough to have Ivy‍ to clean up a messed up powder fill. She fixed  me up...Over the top!
She's probably the best nail tech/artist I have ever been to!"
__label__5	This is the best seafood in Nashville in my opinion. The staff is super friendly, attentive & experienced. The oysters are 'to die for' and everything on the menu is excellent. Great wine & cocktail list & the atmosphere is upbeat & modern. The patio is my favorite spot. We can't wait to go back!
__label__5	Adopted our dog from Diane's almost 2 years ago. We had a great experience! We also love that we can bring her in to have her nails trimmed. The staff is awesome!
__label__5	"If you like eating...you'll love this place!
I ordered the corned beef po' boy and it was delicious! It was not lacking in meat, tasty bread or dressings... what else could one want?....perhaps some chilli cheese fries? done. My friend ordered those and they were decadent.
There is the option to have table service or you may order at a window for and plenty of self-seating. 
Great place! I'd definitely go back!"
__label__5	If you're looking at reviews and see low reviews about  service that's one thing.. but to say it's not good fried chicken is absurd. I thought this place was better then Hattie B's. The medium (which is essentially hot) is just the right amount of spice if you like spicy and tasteful fried chicken. I'd come back here every time I'm in Nashville. It's also a stop in the Nashville Pedal Tavern which is also a great experience if you're visiting Nashville for the first time.
__label__5	Really good! I am originally from Sichuan( the hometown of hotpot), the hotpot here is as good as Sichuan! Recommend!!! If you cannot have spicy food, you can try not spicy soup, it is also delicious!
__label__5	Have been here several times, & it never disappoints!  Great food & good choice of beers!  We love to sit on the patio!
__label__5	"I love craft beer, especially hazy IPA!  This is my favorite brewery anywhere - lucky that my job relocated me to Tucson to be near this gem! 

These guys have such a great setup to still get you your favorite beers during the pandemic- grateful for their curbside pickup and easy online ordering! 

We can't wait to safely be back in the brewery playing games with our friends and enjoying your awesome beer, PV!"
__label__5	Simply an amazing experience. Great food, drink and staff. Of course, I had to get the Batali for my first time there. I will definitely be back.
__label__5	I loved this place! My friend brought me here and said it was the best.  He did not lie! The menu was awesome.  More variety than the average place.  It was quaint with a shabby chic vibe.  Service and food terrific!  Will make this my place each time I'm in Indy.
__label__5	Just had a relaxing late lunch and great glass of wine! The wine was high quality and inexpensive. The food was delicious- you order off of the Wine Cask menu. We ate outside, but the tasting room has plenty of room to sit at the tasting bar- you can taste, order a glass of wine or purchase a bottle to drink (at retail cost!!). As a local, finding a new place that has great food, relaxing atmosphere and friendly service is refreshing (and doesn't happen very often!).
__label__5	A great museum to visit if you are in New Orleans.  We spent a little over six hours there and probably could have spent another six.
__label__5	This place was a homerun. We were in Reno to catch a flight home, but we had several hours to kill.  The beers were great. We shared multiple appetizers, which were great. There was a live band, which was great. The bartender was very nice and helpful. Rooftop seating is always a plus. We had a great time. I wish my hometown had a place like this, because I would go all the time.
__label__5	"We ordered muffuletta and a croissant, it was delicious!!!
The beignets are good too but not as good as Le cafe du monde."
__label__5	Little unknown gem in Tampa. Has a very nice atmosphere with great tea and comfortable seats that make you never want to leave! The Houdini sandwich is a personal favorite of mine and at a price that can't be beat. But I would go there for the desserts alone. The friendly staff told me they are looking to expand the menu, and I am excited to see whats in store!!
__label__5	"Great pizza, great wings! The staff were amazingly friendly and efficient! While customer service has become a lost art elsewhere, it is alive and well at Marco's! It is our new pizza place!

Frank, the general manager, took great care of us!"
__label__5	This place was pretty bomb. Was looking for something other than a normal fast food chain and this place did the trick.
__label__5	Now I understand why this hotel is so recommended.Everything about it from The grand entrance and  the antique elevators scream - history and elegance. The rooms are spacious and Updated without losing their Southern charm. Their on site restaurant was wonderful and so was the staff. I will always stay at The Hermitage when in town. The level of service along with the accommodations were 5 star.
__label__5	"Charming rustic farmhouse location with a very friendly and knowledgeable staff. Award winning wines available for tasting or by the glass, with a heated deck, outside table seating and a quiet back room as well. 

We've been a handful of times and are impressed with each visit. The staff is always happy to explain any wine in detail, and gives great suggestions for wines by the glass. 

Snacks are available as well, cheese plates and light meals. Penns Woods fits nicely into the local winery trail, and is a great spot to hit if you are touring other local wineries."
__label__5	David was super friendly and welcoming.  He sells the cleanest juice on the market, Blue Lab Vapors. Very clean and non-intimidating atmosphere. He was super knowledgeable in CBD and made great recommendations based on our personal needs.
__label__5	"Professional and eager to help. Not an inexpensive place to shop or repair bikes, but they do things correctly. 

Sometimes they have a friendly puppy there to say hello to ALL of their guests; always a warm touch. Top-notch service and high-end bikes. Great people!"
__label__5	"I'm from I'm out of town and was doing some exploring. I went to Southeastern Salvage an M.D. when I came out, decided I needed my nails done. Looked up nail salons and found this one. I thought I'd give it a try. It's pricy but definitely worth it!!!
The nail tech was extremely nice and made me feel welcomed and did an awesome job on my nails and couldn't be more pleased. Thank You nails and cocktails"
__label__5	Cozy coffeehouse/cafe' located on the historic St. Charles main street. Serving sandwiches, hot dogs, coffee, espresso drinks, tea and lemonade. Great relaxing atmosphere and friendly workers.
__label__5	Amazing beer selection, great food, great service, and amazing atmosphere. They have tons of private stock/cellar beers that are pricey but are always worth the extra cost. I suggest going on a nice day so that you can get a seat on the hidden side alley. Try the wings!
__label__5	The menu is always great, but it's the pizza and cocktails that bring me back. Top notch!
__label__5	Amazing food cooked to order, delicious sides and friendly staff. I keep getting the same chicken sandwich and tots. Great local spot.
__label__5	After a devastating nail appointment with another salon, I went here to be rescued. Julie is absolutely amazing! She takes a little longer than expected, but her work is definitely worth it. She is a perfectionist, which you don't find in a lot of Salons. I will definitely be going back. Highly recommended! Make an appointment.
__label__5	I recently used Lucky Strike to split about 3 cord of wood.   There was a high chance of rain that day so I assumed they were going to call and cancel.  Instead they came prepared with a pop-up tent and worked non-stop until the work was done.  They were on time, hard working and very professional.  I highly recommend them and will definately be using them again myself in the future.
__label__5	It's a bit of a drive from where we live but it was worth it. Honda Crown has excellent customer service and their staff is friendly and professional. It was an excellent experience. Serg (sp?)  was our sales associate and he was terrific. In fact, everyone was terrific.  I recommend them to all our friends and family now.  They're that good.
__label__5	"What a pleasant surprise! 
Was hesitant to try when I saw ""Bowl"" in its name. My sons and I ordered 3 bowls; unagi, rib eye tataki, and pork toro kakuni. We've been spoiled by the good food in many restaurants  and also disappointed often enough, not to expect anything really good...sorry, but just relying from Yelp or Check Please reviews have not always worked out. This was a really tasty and different experience. Of the 3 bowls, the pork was our favorite. Before we left, we ordered another one to go."
__label__5	Really yummy pizza and the pickup process during covid has been solid and safe. We order from here once a week and their pies always taste fresh and delicious, they don't cut corners on quality! Get a Dave's pie you won't regret it.
__label__5	BBQ was delicious. Chatted with the cooks they were both super nice. Great place for good BBQ in New Orleans, would definitely recommend for anyone visiting the city
__label__5	Good food and great service. Waiter (can't remember his name..he had mentioned he was from Wisconsin) was very friendly and prompt. Will be back in the future due to his personable service and the nice beach view.
__label__5	Stopped in on our way to Los Olivos a few months ago.  Great find, food and service.
__label__5	I was very impressed by these folks. They clearly know their stuff, but above all else, they're honest and don't overcharge. I had been looking for a go-to place for computer repair. I have found it.
__label__5	Amazing food, clean environment, mostly friendly staff. Just a great experience all around and unique.
__label__5	My wife and I have been here a time or two. This time was outstanding. Ben Taylor, our waiter this evening, was maybe the best waiter I have ever experienced. Knowledgeable, personable, all you could ask from a seasoned waiter at a high end steak house.  And the food was great. We will be back if Ben waits on us. Great service is the separator, if everyone at Prime is as great as Ben, Prime will be our favorite.
__label__5	"Last time I was in Baileys Range was about 4 years ago and this time around could have been the best bout yet. Many other places don't hold true to the nostalgia that you hold for them but Bailey's Range delivers. 

Matt the bArTeNdEr tells it how it is. Drink variety ranged from boozy shake to margarita to spicy margarita to spiked tea and around each corner each drink was perfect, even though you'd hate to tell him this to his face. Quintessential bar experience if you like to belly up. 

Go here. Drink. Eat burgers. They are good."
__label__5	"This is the restaurant I craved the most when I lived out of state.
I'm sad to see the one by the parthenon has closed but I did get there one last time before that happened.

The dipping sauce for the nachos is awesome!"
__label__5	"Lawn Klippers gets it done! Keith truly came through after a glitch with the last lawn care service fizzled out. He gave a reasonable quote and cut the next day (due to rain). 

Keith was also able to trim up the palms and made my yard pop! 

I appreciate all that he has done and couldn't ask for better service!

From one vet to another...Thank you Keith!"
__label__5	We love the Bayou Cafe. The breakfast is awesome. If you go M-F before 10, the special is a great deal and very filling. Wait staff always professional and timely.
__label__5	We are here on vacation.  For breakfast, gotta do the Frog Pond.  The food is great and the service is incredible.  Had to go back a second time.
__label__5	"Stopped in for a quick bite during a layover. They were switching the menu over from breakfast to lunch so the waited put my lunch order in when the kitchen was ready for it. 
The turkey club was good but the sweet potato waffle fries were amazing! I ate them with syrup and was very pleased.
Prices are fair, wait staff is quick and polite. I would definitely eat here again."
__label__5	"Had my desk assembled through Office Depot 
in Parker Colorado.  Apollo  sent Peter who was absolutely amazing. Called to give me a heads up on his arrival, was  on time, wore his mask, and did the job like a real professional.   Great service!"
__label__5	Best ice cream & gelato on St Pete Beach. Tons of flavors & ice cream drinks, desserts. Gelato is thick & fresh. 20+years in the business, they know how to keep their customers HAPPY!! Definitely stop in!!
__label__5	If I could leave more stars I would. Jim and his crew went above and beyond when cutting down a tree in our yard. They were so careful not to damage a fence and or house that was near the tree. When they left the yard was cleaned up as if a tree was never there. I will use them again and again. I have recommended them to a few friends and will anytime I hear someone needs a tree trimmed, removed or any landscaping work done. Thank you!!
__label__5	Probably one of my favorite spots in midtown. The service is great. The people are kind. The food is excellent. I get Portland vibes when I eat here. The atmosphere and the setup. My favorite is the pita with a cup of soup on the side. Their dressing on the cranberry salad is to die for! I'm always a satisfied customer. Even with limited seating while it's cold it's fine to wait. And when it's nice out the outside seating is killer!
__label__5	My experience with the staff at coastal spine has bee great especially with Sharon the scheduler.  Sharon does her very best to relieve you of you fears of the procedures as she schedules you plus recently I was unable to walk and she was able to communicate with Dr. Paul to get me meds to try and help me.   Great Job Sharon you are a great representative and extension of coastal spine
__label__5	this one is a free standing panda by Wal mart on 50 it's about 2 years old and we go constantly it is super clean we met the owner when he came to check things they open at 1030 am and it's delicious tastes fresh and healthy and yum
__label__5	Great food. Awesome lunch specials. A great affordable Mexican food joint. Putting this one on the list of go-to's.
__label__5	Found this spot on a whim. Fabulous coffee and service. Super nice owners. My hubby drinks tea and they had a nice selection. I love dark roast coffee (hard to find here) and it was great. Nice seating area. Quiet enough to work. Will visit again!
__label__5	I have ordered t-shirts from Defend New Orleans before, so it was a treat to finally make it into the shop. Love the style of the store and everything they have to offer.
__label__5	This place is delicious! The service was outstanding.. From the delicious wine, appetizers to the amazing special meal of the day. The desserts were even to die for! Our server, Martin, was excellent and attentive! We will be back for sure!!
__label__5	"Forgive me, as I forgot our servers name. Anna or Annie. She was a PEACH & such fun! 
There was another guy, pink face mask. Forgive me as I didn't get his name. LOVED him.! 

Had dinner with my husband & brother in law. 
My husband ordered the Whiskey River BBQ Chicken wrap & I had the California Chicken sandwich. 
Mudd Pie, is ridiculously HUGE. I LOVE sweets, but for the life of me, couldn't devour it all.

Thanks for treating us well, RR!"
__label__5	Great location as well as great food! Located in one of the most amazing areas in St Louis this place offers a budget friendly option with great tasting food and drinks! I highly recommend T-N-T Wieners as my #1 dining choice in the St Louis loop area.
__label__5	Nicole helped turn my front closet into the most organized and well-utilized space in my house!!
__label__5	"I love shopping here - always great customer service & product selection. They carry local Mennonite cage-free eggs which makes me really happy! I appreciate that Whole Foods works with local producers.

Shout out to the youngster working the floral department who helped me land on this happy little arrangement I popped into a previously-enjoyed jar of peanut butter! The gentleman was super fun to work with & smell things with. 

I've loved all the staff I've encountered here & so enjoy my morning shopping trips! Such a great atmosphere :))"
__label__5	I love this chick-fil-a. They are so nice. I accidentally ordered the wrong meal and didn't notice until after they gave me the food. They apologized, gave me a full refund, and let me keep both meals for free. Best customer service ever!
__label__5	"I was just trying to decide on dinner tonight and remembered philly Phlava, thank goodness I've still got some working brain cells.
Good Stuff!!"
__label__5	Just go. Not sure what else to say. This place is outstanding. From the house salad to the best lasagna I've ever had. Stop searching and pick this place.
__label__5	"The food here is fantastic. I've never had a bad meal here yet.  The plantaines with lechon is one of my favorite dishes.

The service is also very good, they make a killer iced tea, and you can eat on the heated porch in winter.  Great Collingswood restaurant."
__label__5	Sumptuous Food And Service. Enjoyed Thoroughly and Very Friendly Service and Staff. Would Visit Again.
__label__5	Mickey is a sweetheart and has such a fun spirit. The sandwiches are the best!! (And I'm a huge sandwhich critic) I got the Italian and can't wait to try the London broil next!
__label__5	"An amazing spot for brunch, on this visit.  The vibe of the place is so cool.  Service and food is outstanding.  

I recommend you try few things and share to eat the most out of the menu and for sure check out one of their cocktails as they are just amazing.

Enjoy!"
__label__5	Nice stadium, field, and facilities. Looking fwd to coming back. I thought it was cool having a concert after the game.
__label__5	I took my dog to world of animals and they really exceeded my expectations in terms of service and thoroughness. Dr Stupine is empathetic, a good listener and an excellent diagnostician. The staff and he both checked in on how my dog was doing after the visit. On top of their great service and accessibility (they are open evenings and weekends!) they are reasonably priced
__label__5	What more could you ask for? Great wines, great servers, great ambiance, great puppy (love you jojo)... you get the gist :)
__label__5	"24/7 Mexican goodness. 

The BEST authentic Mexican food in Tampa! Love the barbacoa meat, especially with lots of spicy green sauce. The tamales are amazing too, but only available on the weekends. And the pineapple water is pure love! So refreshing and sweet. I could drink it all day. 

And all that deliciousness is made and served from a bus. Taco Bus FTW!"
__label__5	"It's been a while since I've been back here and it's still just as cozy. Nothing really fancy just a great, cheap place to get pampered with my an my wife.

We came back to see Anita as she is the best in Santa Barbara.
Same genuine little oriental lady who gives a fantastic pedicure!

Other that a little wait, now that it's busier than before, it's still the best I've been to."
__label__5	"This place is awesome! I am always blow away at how good the food and the service is. They really know what they are doing at Café 72. 
Jim N"
__label__5	Delia and her team are really helpful and truly customer centric. Cheers to all!!
__label__5	Love this place! food is good! I come all the time with my daughter she loves the ba baw as for I like everything they have on the menu.
__label__5	"This is a very unique space with incredible charm and character. The whipped ricotta was an absolute MUST!!! I am from Chicago and would walk to Philadelphia to get that again. 
Staff was very friendly and helpful."
__label__5	Every server I've ever had here has been extremely efficient and friendly! Jen, the bartender, is fantastic!!!
__label__5	Yelp did not let us down! Excellent pulled pork plate, tasty, crisp slaw, yummy onion rings & okra. Really liked the cornbread pancake as well. Made me want to go home and experiment with some variations. Service was quick and friendly, and (bonus) it's really close to I-40 for us Yankees passing through. Hope to return!
__label__5	Great food, fast and friendly service! Wide selection on their menu. Definitely going back!
__label__5	Hot & fresh EVERY time. Full of flavor. Authentic. Very kind people. Convenient location and quick service.
__label__5	I never ate at their actual restaurant but I go to their bakery all the time they have excellent food there my favorite is the red bean sesame ball but everything else I've tried I've loved.
__label__5	Michael Solomonov absolutely killed it again with Merkaz. Merkaz gives you the opportunity to eat the amazing hummus that is served at the popular Zahav, in a more casual setting (and without a 3 month wait). Seriously...you cannot visit without getting the hummus. Solomonov restaurants have the BEST hummus in Philadelphia! Also, the lamb pita is fantastic! Perfectly marinated and has all of the right flavors. This is definitely a spot I'd recommend getting your order to-go because seating fills up fairly quick.
__label__5	Simply AH-amazing! I loved it!!!!!! The blueberry cheesecake was so delicious my my my ! So good!
__label__5	I had the schnitzel with fries when I ate here and both were cooked to perfection.  The atmosphere was very relaxed.
__label__5	The aesthetics are amazing! Love the interior decor its so earthy and vintage. The open kitchen makes the space feel so airy. The food was DELICIOUS! And the service was efficient. Great tastes for the prices and a great complement to the other locations! This may be my fave!
__label__5	"We stopped in over the weekend and we were only one of two parties in the restaurant.  It was a weird time of day but this place should NEVER be that empty.  The food is great.  We shared a number of the small plates; everything was nicely presented and tasted fabulous. 

Our waiter did a great job and the chef was super friendly.  The is a place that has earned a spot in my regular rotation."
__label__5	this is one of the best places to try something your taste buds will super love red beans and rice are one of the best but i going back to try many more!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__5	"Clean as expected 

Easy parking.

Location close to major town and easy commute. 

Standard nice Home Depot."
__label__5	Such a cute little donut shop off of 12th!! I'm really glad this wasn't just a hype! The donuts really are good!! I tried two flavors with some self control! I wanted to try them all! I tried the vanilla bean glaze which tasted like a glazed donut x 100 and a monthly special which was blueberry lemon with Lemon zest glaze! That was delicious!!
__label__5	A little pricey but the atmosphere, food and drinks are hard to top. Fox concepts knows what they're doing
__label__5	Great burgers, hole in the wall atmosphere!! A must have in NOLA!!! First time here & everything rocked!!
__label__5	Went to Chicks on Saturday 1/27/18. 7 of us for Brunch.  Great Place!!!. Food was fabulous.  The Shrimp and Grits best ever.  The Artichoke Pizza was a great choice.  The Beet and Orange salad was a favorite.  Love this Place.   Highly recommend.
__label__5	Mama...love your empanadas! Love the selection and sauces...friendly staff.. Keep em coming !!!
__label__5	"The inside-out pizza is terrific here. You can get it either deep fried or baked. I like baked. We buy lots and keep them in the freezer for snacks and ""emergency"" meals. The regular pizza is excellent as well -- they have a wide range of toppings."
__label__5	Fantastic spot to eat while in Santa Barbara!! Try the eggplant and goat cheese ravioli, simply delicious!!! The evening's special was Italian sausage and spinach ravioli, absolutely delicious as well! We went on a Tuesday night and it wasn't very busy, but the restaurant is small and tables are close to one another. I'd suggest making reservations. Ambiance is elegant/romantic. Our waiter, Andy, was spot on. He was working on 6-7 different tables and he never missed a beat. Food, ambiance, service...excellent!
__label__5	First time going here and it was great! We had the seafood fettuccini and the ahi salad that was recommended by our server and both were delicious. Our server was Erika, you should ask to be put her in her section. She was fast and super friendly. And there were no errors in our order! Definitely recommend this place!  We will be going again
__label__5	The best eyebrow place in Indiana!! She takes the time and cares about all her clients. I've been going to her for 5 years now and she never disappoints
__label__5	Matt and RJ with Appliance Wholesalers were our lifesavers!! Our fridge went out and all of the big box sellers had their 4th of July sale, but with that came their LONG delivery schedule that we couldn't work with.Appliance Wholesalers had what I was looking for and more for a lot LESS!!! Plus we got next day delivery!  So much food will be saved and my sanity! Located in Westport and easy to get to!
__label__5	Really good, fresh pizza served by friendly staff. Everyone was upbeat and happy, and the food was amazing. There were plenty of unique vegetarian options which is rare at a fast casual restaurant. Will definitely be back!
__label__5	I wish I could give this place 10 stars, really. These guys handled the repairs on our AC. They are fantastic, starting with Adrianna, quite possibly the friendliest person you'll ever have to deal with at a company, and extending to the technicians. They're fast, friendly as all heck, patient when you have questions, honest and they provide the best service they can without blinking an eye. I promise you won't have a bad experience with this place.
__label__5	"Back again on a Friday night to try the triple habanero pizza. Long wait, but we were warned...before we ordered, we were warned it would be 50 minutes. Fair enough...it was actually less than 50 mins.Triple Hab was well executed...frankly not much spicier than the single... although I could see 3x as many habs on it. I strongly recommend adding pineapple...really rounds out the pie.

I'll be back...great stuff. The quality in toppings really shows."
__label__5	Second time in here, ordered the Turkey Avocado everyone has been raving about. Tower Deli delivered. It was great! Seems they are quicker in the ordering process than last time. Will visit again.
__label__5	I went to Yats on 96 street, and they take credit cards! I used to go to the one in College that does not. They let me try a few different ones, and I got a half and half. The food was great, and I will go back for sure. Especially if I am short on time. This place was lightening fast.
__label__5	I GAINED 87 LBS after I left KPOT. If you're on KETO this is the place to go. All you can eat meat for 26.99.... everything was amazing! Highly recommend !!!!
__label__5	What a selection on this DSW. The largest in the country. How could I resist, I bought some shoes. It is my wife's fault.
__label__5	"Perfect spot to sit in the sun & sip tea with friends. 
The park is clean & adorable.
Has a carousel for kids & a play ground.
Just watched people riding around on segways.
Right by Chinatown. Grab a bubble tea and go check it out!"
__label__5	"Visiting Nashville during a six-week USA trip. Found these guys via YELP (thanks) and they were great! The young woman who served us was so helpful and did two bags of laundry for us in a couple of hours. She phoned me as soon as it was ready, and we returned to find it all folded and put back into our two carry-on suitcases. 
Good service, with a smile, and genuine politeness - and less than $30 all up.
Excellent!"
__label__5	"The burgers are fantastic, they give you more fries than you could want (and they're amazing), and the guys in there are super nice and helpful. They have tons of great sauces too. 

We prefer the West Main Street location to the Cool Springs one, but the food is the same. We like the atmosphere better there and don't feel like we smell like burgers when we leave. We love Ground!"
__label__5	A Fairmount treasure, in my opinion! I'll be honest, I've only been several times for breakfast/brunch and drinks, but each time I've gone it's been a perfect experience. The staff is nice, the food is SO delicious and their skylight dining room is seriously cozy, especially on a sunny day.
__label__5	I've been here for both brunch and dinner.  Love their fried pickles, Richard's Duck Blind Dlux, Shrimp Salad, margaritas.  Great ambiance and decent prices considering the quality of the food and downtown location.
__label__5	They made chicken tacos in soft corn tortillas for me even though they were not on the menu..lady was nice and helpful...the tacos were delicious and what set them off was the salsa verde and the spicy salsa roja i asked for..authentic street style tacos with cilantro onions and lime...will be back
__label__5	Great happy hour prices, 7 days a week! Awesome bartenders with sparkling personalities! :) Tons of tv's to catch the game on, pool tables, dart boards, dj's on the weekends so you can bust a move on the dance floor, some patio seating if you prefer to enjoy whatever Idaho weather we're having, and an elevator for your convenience!
__label__5	Didn't know where to eat quickly in Nashville. This place popped up, and it was exactly what my friend and I were looking for in our time crunch! Great food and quick. Would go back if I'm ever in Nashville.
__label__5	We always eat breakfast every day at Cafe Fleur De Lis when we are in New Orleans.
__label__5	"This was a first time experience with Smoking Barrels BBQ and they didn't disappoint!  Got the pulled pork (delivery by GrubHub) and it was delicious.  Juicy with a great smoky BBQ flavor.  So happy I discovered this gem.

I waited less than an hour for delivery, so no complaints!"
__label__5	Very warm and friendly staff.   Unusual for a government facility but this one is very different in my opinion.  Thanks for making it so easy !!!
__label__5	"Had a fantastic lunch with drinks. I had the Creole Trio and my wife had a Portabello
Po' boy. I had a NOLA ale and she killed a Hurricane. The food was incredible and the service was great. The staff were very friendly and we felt very welcomed. Loves it!!!"
__label__5	Great selection of lingerie and toys etc.  Salespeople are very helpful and Knowledgeable.  My boyfriend's dream.
__label__5	"Great experience..twice.   We had lunch and went back for dinner the same day.   It was that good.  We highly recommend the crab claws as a starter.   

Tessa was our server for both meals...and made us feel at home.  Perfect service.  Thank you very much for a memorable day."
__label__5	There is a great buffet. It has options for vegan and vegetarians. It is under 12 bucks.  The facility is gorgeous, and the wait staff is attentive.  We had a large group there and we all had a nice time and enjoyed the food.
__label__5	This place was the best. Tony was our waiter. Area insider knows all the great spots for shopping.
__label__5	Was able to explore the Harvest Day displays with my Lume ticket. This was not the traditional Harvest Day held in the weekends so it wasn't crowed and not all exhibits like the Lily House open. It was still totally worth while to walk the grounds and enjoy the creativity of what the staff come up with. It would definitely be worth it to come for Harvest Nights or the weekend Harvest Days. Just buy tickets early as they sell out quick. The Lume exhibit is amazing and very worth a visit.
__label__5	Great for breakfast and brunch.  Excellent food and attentive service.  I always order either the Hawaiian breakfast or loco moco.  Great experience every time!! Highly recommend for brunch.
__label__5	Fantastic place. Love it every time I go. At least a couple times a month. Love the size of the menu and variety. Owners are always present and care what's going on with the customers.
__label__5	"Russ is one of the best restauranteurs in America. You've got to ask to see Russ. 

60 beers is a good start. 

8 cheeseburgers is a good middle. 


Service staff that makes the chains blush with embarrassment is the closing of the perfect circle. 


Now if Russ the owner had a religious call we'd all be going to heaven."
__label__5	My experience with Schneider's service was awesome, they helped me get my Samsung TV working again, even though unit was outside of warranty. They are honest, knowledgeable, and extremely helpful. Five stars
__label__5	This is my favorite breakfast! It's hard to find a place that gives you FRESH strawberries with your waffles! ;)
__label__5	If you love bacon and excellent customer service, you HAVE to eat here! Bacon station constantly comes to my work on food truck days, and I am completely impressed. While the menu is fairly basic, their food is nothing short of fantastic. The crew that runs it is always friendly, always preparing food in a fairly efficient manner, and a joy to buy food from.
__label__5	Great service great people I used them for my home guys were so clean and didn't break anything
__label__5	This place is a great place to go to if you want food and hookah. I like that they have great variety customer service is great and you will always have someone checking up on you to make sure you are doing good. Hookah is okay but it's just another option. The priority is the food to them. Everything does take a while to come out but it's a restaurant not a fast food spot. Shout out to our server named Ally she was great with recommending specials and hookah flavors. The only downside is that they used a cheaper brand of shisha called samba.
__label__5	Visited this place while on a weekend vacation. We came across the Jazz Cafe because we miraculously found a parking spot right out front which in New Orleans is pretty difficult. We checked it out and looked like a pretty laid back place playing old school funk and RnB so we said why not. 10 strong $4 cocktails later we were having the best time! Live band at night and cheap cocktails? I'm in! Definitely coming back to visit the amazing staff!
__label__5	Awesome atmosphere, neighborhood, service, and menu. Drinks were amazing. A few of my friends got The Big Fix. Retro diner vibes with some delicious southern brunch. Can't beat it.
__label__5	Great beer selection. Menu lends itself to lunch/afternoon outing for foodies. Will definitely be back!
__label__5	My car broke down on a friday night on the hill from Truckee. sent messages to many tow companies  , only got 1 response right away from D&s. Thank Megan...Jim, the driver, drove me up the next morning and made a stressful event stress free....Great conversations and very helpful with the drive back   they have the big platform truck which also gave me peace of mind...charged me 5 bucks less than quoted ! Then Jim went out of his way to drive me back to the house...Thanks again Jim & D&S!!!!
__label__5	Friendly staff, quick moving line, and amazing ice cream!! I had a great experience visiting this store! The staff were fun and kept conversation going as they created my ice cream and made it a true one of a kind experience. I would highly recommend Sweet Charlie's!
__label__5	I love TAP! I love the big mason jars filled with Thai iced tea and I always get great Thai food every time. One of my favorite Thai food places in SB.
__label__5	"Exceptionally courteous staff. Completely professional yet simple with their explanations of what was going on. Never made me feel like I wasn't important to them nor did they not make me feel at home. I didn't feel like they were trying to do work to me that wasn't necessary. I would not only go back to them again, but I would tell others that they don't make it feel like going to the dentist, has to feel like ""going to the dentist""."
__label__5	This is a regular lunch stop for me. Everything I've ever tried has been wonderful. All the lunch specials come with a chicken and rice soup and a chicken spring roll. These are just the beginning of what will be a great meal. I highly recommend the Curry Chicken, it's YUMMY!
__label__5	This is THE best place for a cool treat in sunny St Pete! So many delicious flavors from which to choose--they'll give you free samples to help you narrow it down. A bit pricey but you get what you pay for, so don't expect to find fast-food drive-thru ice-cream cone prices.
__label__5	Go see Kayla! Super relaxing facial experience, everyone there is nice and helpful! Easy to get to location behind the main drag of Green Hills. I always fall asleep when I'm getting my facial and I'm usually someone who talks during a massage.
__label__5	"I love this store. We have brought out international friends to this store and they were very pleased with the quality, prices, and variety. 

I shop here about twice per month, as I live 10 miles away. I always find their produce to be high quality and fresh. 

The product selection is vast and excellent to give you choices in St. Louis county for every ethnic taste."
__label__5	Wow, wow a million times wow! Food is OUT OF CONTROL - don't miss the Italian Poutine. Not to mention their owner and staff are the nicest people around!
__label__5	After contacting Mike for an estimate for something we weren't sure we were going to do, Mike saw how odd our plumbing was and mentioned what it should be.  We definitely agreed and since we needed a lot done we asked him to redo almost all of our plumbing including the pipe from our house to the water main.  Not only was it done quick, but the basement looks great and we haven't had any issues since.  I would (and have) recommend Cangemi plubming to anyone that needs any plumbing work done.
__label__5	"Best sushi in the Santa Barbara/Goleta area for the best price!

Everytime I've been there I never leave unsatisfied. Great portion sizes and large variety of rolls to choose from, even though I usually just stick with the Godzilla roll, which is absolutely lights out. Don't forget about the spicy mayo.

Can't say enough good things about the place, other than I wish there was a happy hour :(.

George is the man. Hardest working, best server in town."
__label__5	I had a Swedish Massage for an hour and not gonna lie it was very relaxing and for $65 i think it was a pretty good deal. The massage was nothing crazy. They compliment you with tea afterwards. The facility was very clean and fresh! I would come here again to try the floating and possibly a different type of massage. I was looking for something more advanced.
__label__5	"The burgers here are amazing! Love the Main Street Fries too.  And surprisingly, the PB&J burger is incredible! I never thought I would like it, but it was sooooo good. Highly recommend living outside your comfort zone and trying it.

The beer menu is also pretty good. The bar tenders know their beer, and have always made good recommendations and are always willing to chat about beer in general with you.  I've been coming for years and will continue to do so."
__label__5	We had been meaning to try this place for a while but hadn't yet. We stopped in on a whim tonight without reservations and they worked us right in.  The bread and dipping oil were delicious as a starter.  My husband ordered the lentil soup, also very good. He ordered the salmon special and I had the baked ziti.  Both were outstanding.  The service was wonderful.  We highly recommend this place and we'll absolutely be back!
__label__5	absolutely amazing. 2 best things combined into one; kitty shelter & coffee shop. i love everything about Kawaii Kitty Cafe & plan to go there frequently. all the kitties are so cute & the whole place has such a comfortable atmosphere. never stop being so cute
__label__5	Great place for take out or get it delivered fast! The food is always top quality. Been eating their for years and everything on the menu is great. They make a garlic bread cheesesteak that's out of this world!
__label__5	My kids and I have been coming here for years. They availability can't be beat. Dr. Shulte is the best and always takes her time and explains everything thoroughly.
__label__5	Large quantities of well priced, delicious, fresh, beautifully presented food. We got the Lebanese nachos (meat on the side), falafel plate with lentil soup and a side salad. It came with soft warm pita bread.
__label__5	Jayson was very friendly and helpful. Panda Express in Goleta is lucky to have such a great employee.
__label__5	"Service and prices the way it should be . This guy knows what he is doing! I had a special turquoise faced watch that anther place couldn't fix. Fixed here( inner spring repair on Swiss movement)! Also got bracket on Rolex shortened and battery and band on time.
 A bit hard to find ( no signage), walk to the end of alley/ walkway near cricket store."
__label__5	The Sweety Pie Pizza is to die for! The menu is full​ of HOMEMADE delicacies.​ ​Overall you won't find a better ​ ,cleaner and serving quality food made with love in the entire​ are!
__label__5	Great food, very fresh & tasty!!!!! Love crepes and krepelicious knows how to make 'em.
__label__5	"What's not to like? Beautiful building, great bookstore and great coffee. There's also what looks to be a great tea parlor and a small restaurant but I haven't tried either. 

One of my biggest gripes with Tampa is the lack of good coffee houses. It's really mind blowing to me just how bad the situation is for coffee enthusiasts. So I'm very glad to have found at least a nice cup of pour over even if it means a half hour drive. Their expresso drinks need some tweaking, but beggars can't be choosers."
__label__5	Been there on multiple occasions.  Great food with great service.  I love the combination pho.
__label__5	This place came recommended, tried it and it was amazing. My husband is from Philly and very picky about cheesesteaks. He gave this place five stars. You must try it!!
__label__5	"So I tried char grilled oysters at 4 different places in the French quarter and even the places the locals recommended for ""best oysters"" were nowhere near as good. They are BEYOND amazing here. They also have a nice selection of other ones... bienville which is shrimp and cheese on top as well as buffalo and others. Can't rate on other food but the oysters and the service is amazing !!"
__label__5	Love the patio and beer selection for the summer! And I've always had a great meal when I've came here, I'd definitely recommend.
__label__5	Awesome! Food is amazing! Cool vibe to the place. Artsy - local artist's work on the walls, menu on chalkboard. Menu changes/rotates, so everyday is a little different. Fresh, healthy. Vegan options available, too. Good portions - I got 2 meals out of my food bowl. The iced hibiscus tea is to die for. Large spirit/beer selection, too. Doesn't look like much from the outside, but it is amazing inside; food, staff, vibe.
__label__5	This place deserves more than 10-Stars.  The food is absolutely delicious.  The restaurant is a gem of Philadelphia.  I find this place very romantic.  Noise level is perfect.  Service was wonderful.  Enjoyed my date night with my husband this evening and this restaurant was the cherry on top.  My husband and I are so happy we found a new restaurant to return to, time after time.  Thank you Chef and staff for a lovely evening :)
__label__5	Great food with excellent service.  Coffee has a nice bold flavor.  Aztec mocha has a nice kick that will be sure to get you going in the morning.
__label__5	I had the vegan kimchi sandwich with an over-hard egg. It was delicious with a kick of spice!
__label__5	Amazing place!! Very reasonably priced, great coffee, and most of all you get to pet the most adorable adoptable cats! Literally did not want to leave this place (cause this is what heaven must be like). The staff is very friendly and it's a very clean establishment despite cats being everywhere lol definitely recommend!
__label__5	Beautiful tasting room with a solid tasting menu. Bottle prices are a bit high for what they are, but overall loved this place. Will definitely go back next time we are in SB
__label__5	"Awesome little find. We got Poboys oysters and catfish and a chicken/sausage gumbo to try. Go it to go and went down the street to have it with a few beers. 

Sandwiches were on point, little spicy, bread was great, and service was fast, friendly, and they made sure we got what we needed to go. 

I want to come back before I leave to try something else ."
__label__5	Went here finally after moving to Plant City last year. We had a pizza and salad. Will definitely be back. Food was good and so was the service.
__label__5	Great job! Very hard working staff that really work with each other to provide the best experience possible.  The food is fresh and full of flavor.  I had the pad Thai (extra spicy to open my sinuses).  The hot tea was phenomenal and my after dinner drink was amazing.  The prices are surprisingly lower than expected.... probably to get you hooked (LOL).  I look forward to coming back a few times.
__label__5	"Truly the Best people and the easiest to deal with. Rich and his colleagues are phenomenal!
This Enterprise location at Northeast Airport shows everyone else in business how the best customer service is done.

Thankful Customer of 5 years."
__label__5	We had the best dinner at SoDo before the theater.  Special of Swordfish, the best ever!  Although we go to SoDo frequently, tonight was special
__label__5	I tried srilankan vegetarian dish kottu rotti which was amazing. Never had anything like this before, full of flavor. Definitely would come here again.
__label__5	Love this store. It has everything. Pretty much any medium you can think of. Painting, print making, crafts, drawing pads, and TONS of canvases (and picture frames) downstairs. They also have a lot of fun little gifts and cards and things. Highly recommend.
__label__5	I was so happy to see masks being enforced, limiting number of people in store and sanitizing stations. Such a fun store with so much to offer. I love they support local artists. Always look forward to visiting this store.
__label__5	This is an awesome lil shop. I got a chance to speak with the owner and her husband. They are wonderful. I'm pretty bad about taking care of my skin but their face masks are a fast and easy way to take care of your face.  They have so many products that I had never seen before. I sent photos to a friend that knows her products and she was blown away at the selection. Definite hot spot for people on the go!
__label__5	Christina was amazing! The best waitress and took care of us from the very beginning!!
__label__5	I have been here golfing three times with friends and we absolutely love this course.  It's a great layout, in great shape in a very scenic setting.  We'll be back.
__label__5	Excellent Italian restaurant great food and service. A real Pizzaria.
__label__5	This is the best vegan food I've ever had. I'm vegan and my boyfriend isn't but he loves this place. The staff is so awesome and kind. New regulars!! Dank af
__label__5	Steak frites are amazing! All the different sauces are incredible. Not a bad item on the menu. Careful on the Tripel de Ripple. That will kick in faster than you think.
__label__5	It's always a pleasure to see Dr Farina. I have entrusted his expertise with my oldest son and now I am becoming a patient myself! Dr. Farina is kind, knowledgeable, and current with the latest in orthodontics. He has also worked wonders with a dear friend of ours who had very severe orthodontic issues. Visits are on time, quick, and fun! Even during braces my son looked forward to every visit.
__label__5	Gave honesty advice and suggestions even though he was busy. Will definitely be calling next time I have work required or the house.
__label__5	I've been coming here for over a year, every 2 weeks with Amanda, for gel nails and pedicures and I absolutely love her work! She does a great job every time and we talk and laugh through the entire appointment. The spa is very clean, and always professional. I would highly recommend the spa, and although all the girls are good, ask for Amanda!
__label__5	Kendrick was awesome . Perfect girls night out . Super thankful they were open and the drinks were good. Customer service was superb
__label__5	My favorite waxing salon! Joy is my go-to technician... when it comes to my Brazilian she's quick and thorough! Joy also does an AMAZING job on my brows, I always get compliments... Can't say enough good things about her and EWC :)
__label__5	I decided to stop in one evening with a friend to try the place out. Surprising, there was plenty of room to park nearby. We just wanted something quick for dessert, so we got the chocolate shake, and it was great! You could tell that it was freshly made. I will definitely be back to try more of the menu and have a full meal.
__label__5	"Great little sandwich place. Very nice beer selection. My tomato soup was ""the bomb.""  Our service was fantastic."
__label__5	The best spring rolls flavor! I wish the wonton was a little thinner but the flavor is amazing ...
__label__5	food is great as always, management is awesome. service was amazing. definitely recommend for a fun night out with the fam.
__label__5	"This Family owned Deli, Grocery & Catering is Outstanding!  Being from NY, I found this place today!
They were just about to close for the day & I was Starving for a Real Traditional NY Deli Sandwich!
Not only did they take care of me, the Food & Quality Tasted & Felt like being in Brooklyn NY!  ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!!
This is the kind of Business that I will go Back again & again & tell my Friends about!!
Thank You,
Seth Edelman"
__label__5	The flavors are just superb,  and the service wss excellent.  Sometimes everything just clicks and this was one of those times.  Loved sitting at the bar surrounding the kitchen.  Loved the entire space and the experience.  Everyone there seemed so please to be working there.
__label__5	Just had my first visit here this weekend with my mom, and didn't leave to head home until I had my second visit! Beautiful store and collection that is only outshined by how kind the owners are! We loved chatting with Rosemary, and will plan to make it a regular stop in Lahaska-- can't wait to come back!! The items we found here are already very happily settled in our respective homes! Loved it so much, thank you for the special trip!
__label__5	"All I can say is ""mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm""..... Delicious acai bowls topped by granola, honey, banana slices plus a free bee pollen booster..... Sooooo yummy.... My breakfast of choice each day visiting UCSB. $6.50."
__label__5	While Jason's Deli is not my go-to, Chris the manager will go out of his way to ensure you a good experience. He is constantly wiping tables down, refilling the salad bar (which is highly uncharacteristic of most managers I've come across) and will ask you how your meal is. This location is extremely friendly, clean and professional. I would definitely come here again the next time my mom wants to buy me lunch. haha
__label__5	I brought my girlfriend for our 1rst year anniversary and it was a success! Our waitress cinthia never left us waiting and made sure everything was going good and alfredo our busser never left us thirsty. Coming to romanza blew our expectations out the door with such incredible service. Will definitely come back again
__label__5	First time at this location. We had visited the other. We did the Momma platter take out and the food was so awesome. The side of German potato salad was best I ever tasted.  The meat was lean and tasty. We also ordered a side of the bacon which is beyond delish. Portions were decent size. It's kinda far from where we live, but next time we will eat outside on the picnic tables
__label__5	Love their pizza!  The Money Pie is our favorite.  Very fresh ingredients.  They also have great wings and salads.
__label__5	I've had most of the bbq places in Tucson and I think this is the best place by far. Excellent meat, bbq sauce was on point, and the sides were equally good. A lot of places rely too heavily on a good meat and pair it with pathetic sides, but KOS's side were ALL as good. And it was DAMN good. Will definitely be back with friends.
__label__5	Great wash for only $4.00 no car wash in NJ or PA can can even compete with this car was on wash quality let alone the price!! This car wash blows away the competition! And the staff even speaks English! I am a Uber driver so my car needs to be impeccable, I might get it washed with full service twice a week.  oh yeah full service is only $3.00 more to have your car vacuumed and interior wiped down and Windows cleaned! That's $7.00 total!!!! Best car wash I have ever been to!
__label__5	"I'm so thankful to have styled upon t&n! When I went in it was very quaint and friendly. I only went in for a normal egg breakfast - and was blown away.  They make their own spicy ketchup that is insane and I'm obsessed with their version of tater tots - they're like fried mashed potato balls - gotta try them! 

Try one of the fried chicken and waffle cupcakes - they're life changing!"
__label__5	Great service and food. I ordered the Fire Chicken Gangjung and Veggie Mandu. The location was extremely clean and my food was fresh! I will return.
__label__5	I meant to submit this much earlier.  We had friends in town and took them to several Mexican restaurants.  This was the best.  best service and best food.  I will be back!
__label__5	"AMAZING burger.
I'd hold the long hot though, it's very spicy.

Good fries.

Good beer selection.

The meatloaf sandwich  - very good w/ a fried egg

Ambiance is nice, although you might see a good number of hipsters

HIGHLY recommended"
__label__5	"Shelby did SUCH a fantastic job with Henry today.  Prompt, professional, knowledgeable! 
   
I was very skeptical as poodle cuts can be difficult but Shelby knows her cuts! She did 100% what I requested.

Aussie's pricing is high, this cut normally costs me $82 with tip, and today cost $110 before tip. 

But you pay for convenience for your childs, I mean dogs, comfortability - and the fact that I didn't have to drive in traffic to pick up and drop off. 

Henry will be seen every 6 weeks and it will be worth every penny!"
__label__5	This was a great experience. Checked in on line, wait was 17-35 minutes. After a short walk over, at about 35 minutes my phone went off and we were seated. There was a group of 22 sat down as we walked in but we were kept informed about our wait. Everyone on the staff apologized but was not needed, we were enjoying our time. We ordered the pretzels for appetizers and 3 different burgers, all were great, service was great and the ice cream was great, even with the temperature S below 20. GREAT!
__label__5	Absolutely THE BEST pedicure I've had in years!  The leg massage went on forever and the paraffin wrap was soooo soothing!  It even included a hot rock massage all for only $35!!!   My gel nails were done at the same time which saved me tons of time.  This was not only the best experience I've had but also the most value for my money.  Thanks so much Colors Nail Salon for the experience!  I will absolutely be back!
__label__5	If you're looking for a medical spa that can meet all of your needs look no further! I have been to multiple medical spas in the Reno/Sparks area and Esteem surpasses them all. My entire experience from scheduling to receiving treatment and follow up was seamless. Dr Glass is exceptional in all of his work. If you are looking to feel your best and receive treatment that is safe and effective to reach your individualized goals, you found it! I've never been happier and will never receive treatment elsewhere.
__label__5	"The Boathouse was a perfect place for a ""milestone"" reunion trip dinner for 6 high school friends from Nebraska, (and our husbands), thanks to Jordan. I reached out to her via email and she reserved a lovely table for 12, along the window, with beautiful views of the ocean, just after sunset . . . it was amazing!!

We enjoyed great wine, the seafood pasta special, the seabass special, salmon and several other entrees! A huge thank you to Liz and Amanda, who were simply wonderful. We'll all be back, thanks Jordan!"
__label__5	EXCELLENT PLACE!! Food is always exquisite and delicious! This is not your average sandwich shop! They have so many different, unique items on their menu, all of which are excellent. The service is always impeccable as well. The head chefs/ owners of the restaurant are always very friendly & welcoming any time I've been in there & had the chance to speak with them. You can tell they put their hearts into this business & the food 100%. Would recommend this place to anyone and everyone!! So so SO good & worth every penny!!
__label__5	Absolutely awesome! From start to finish, M&G made catering a breeze. Having so many delicious options was the only tough part of the entire process! We chose the fried chicken, BBQ brisket, kielbasa, Mac and cheese, pasta salad, potato salad. EVERYTHING was fresh and phenomenal. Everyone raved about the food and went back for seconds and thirds. You could tell the food was freshly prepared and everything was hot and delicious. Worth every penny! We'll definitely be back for our next party! Thank you!!!
__label__5	We had a large group dinner here on Saturday night. The staff was amazing to work with as was the food. Had a bunch of people tell me it was one of the best meals they have ever had. I would recommend this for any group dinner!
__label__5	This place has become my go to for post workout meals. When it comes to a protein rich, clean, filling meal not much is gonna beat this place. I really enjoy their bowls with grilled chicken and spicy tuna. The meal size is more than adequate. Their Boba drinks are exemplary as well. By far this the best poke place I have found in the Franklin area.
__label__5	Great food and friendly service!  VERY reasonably priced. The items on the menu are just the start, very flexible to get anything special you'd like most evenings. BYOB
__label__5	Whoever made this waffle and this butternut squash soup and the salad obviously cares a great deal about food quality, flavor, nutrition, and most of all delighting the people who eat the food. While we all have to stay far apart, this food makes me feel cared for. And I cannot comprehend how a waffle gets so deliciously chewy around the edges. Recyclable (and maybe some is compostable?) delivery packaging.
__label__5	I love Cyrano's. Beautiful atmosphere from the bar to the intimate fireplace. Dinner and lunch are great but you have to get dessert. If you want bread pudding, this is the spot.
__label__5	Not a huge fan of steak, but I LOVE steak from the Keg. I've had a few options, and they're always so good. I've also had their salmon, which was just ok. I guess it is a steakhouse after all. The appetizers are so good, I could order a few of them and be content. Lobster and escargot appies are insanely good. The twice baked potato is unreal. Servers are always pleasant.
__label__5	"This place is awesome!  I love the live music and I have never had such great, fun and attentive service.  Especially in midtown where bartenders and servers seem to think they are really special for some reason.  
This is my new favorite place!"
__label__5	Haven't been to any ALDI market before and I was surprise to see that this store is neat, clean, and organize! And they are cheap! They have stuff from wine to chips! Definitely will come back and shop kitchen, personal and bar needs!Z
__label__5	James is the professional you want to have show up for the job!  I cannot rate him highly enough.  Don't hesitate-these guys are really super to deal with!
__label__5	Awesome pizza and garlic knots. Cant wait to try something else. Please please please whatever you are doing keep doing it the same way and don't change a thing.
__label__5	If you're on this yelp page to double check the reviews, let me save you some time as there is no point in writing a detailed review on Butcher. It's already been documented from sources much more prestigious than myself. Literally, some of the BEST sandwiches that you can get on the planet. Stop reading. Just go eat here already.
__label__5	Staff is very friendly and accommodating. Yousel is the best -- very nice and helpful. Food is good. They have vegan cheese and gluten- free options!
__label__5	Excellent! The atmosphere is great.  The decor is incredible. Our server was Heather and she was excellent!! I loved the labneh and it was the best falafel I ever had.  My husband had the kafta and that was so flavorful.  This was our first time and we will definitely be back!!
__label__5	Strongest frozen margaritas in town!! The burgers are unbelievable and simple. Go for the sweet potato fries!! Also, no wait at the bar and you can order food too!
__label__5	Amazing food! I had the mushroom Swiss burger and it was juicy, the cheese was stringy and the lettuce and pickles were crisp!! Fries were awesome too! Brest place to go if you're looking fir a quality burger downtown!!
__label__5	What a great surprise ... Happy Hour all day for Mothers Day! Love this place. Gotta try the Salmon Carpaccio! Awesome!!!!
__label__5	This is fantastic pizza some of the best take out I've had. We ordered 4 pies each of different kinds all were excellent! The full clove if garlic on the tomato pie was a bit much but the sauce was exceptional! Next time I'm in philly this is a go to especially in Fishtown.
__label__5	Always good. Not a big fan of custard, but the ice cream is great. The fat free ice icream gives the regular a run for its money!
__label__5	Parking is always a challenge, but the food is excellent!  The gyoza are always grilled perfectly.  Ramen tastes as authentic as our favorite Tokyo noodle shops.  Rice and seasonings always remind me of authentic Japan. Service is prompt and the prices are very reasonable.  It's always a pleasant experience.
__label__5	Service was absolutely great! First time to eat at turning point and loved every single second of it! Can't wait to return! The girls at the front were extremely nice and professional!
__label__5	The sun was out. Walked in, bought a hat, walked back out. End of story.
__label__5	The last time I had falafel this good was in Israel. The staff was friendly and the restaurant was clean and inviting. I cannot wait to eat there again. The falafel wrap wa huge as well. Great value for the money. Thoroughly satisfied.
__label__5	A large group of friends and I attended the opening night event. We were very pleasantly surprised to see how much space there was available. We ended up sitting upstairs and managed to find room for about 20 people. The staff members were all incredibly friendly and accommodating. The beer selection was great as expected. The burger was honestly one of the best I've had in a while. I will definitely be coming back.
__label__5	One of my favorite salvage places anywhere round Indy! Awesome prices and very friendly and helpful staff :]]
__label__5	I've been here a few times now and the food has always been on point. Most recently, I went during a street festival so they had a bunch of extra outdoor seating. The place was busy inside and out but the service was attentive. Their breakfast is so good, can't go wrong with the Bennies or the omelets. I also got the turkey club which was delish. My boyfriend said his burger was great too. Solid brunch spot.
__label__5	The citrus & prawn salad is off the charts sooo good. Prob the best salad I've ever had.. who knew you could create something as good or better than your watermelon or artichoke salad. I'm beyond impressed
__label__5	The attitude of staff members is really great here! They are just as polite as Chick-fil-A team members, possibly even more so. The food and treats are excellent and getting better, and the prices are decent too. Speed of service in the drive-thru is excellent, and lines are not usually very long.
__label__5	Went for the comedy show (which was hilarious btw) and ended up ordering spring rolls and green onion cakes. Not kidding, BEST I have ever had in my entire life! While I wasn't in the actual restaurant (karaoke bar is above) I will absolutely be going back to try more from their menu.  Also, pricing is very fair for the portion size. Yummmm!!
__label__5	Dangerkat is one of a kind, the waffles are delicious and they created a cool back alley vibe. The mural on the outside of the shop is very cool. This place is locally owned, and great for a takeout waffle.
__label__5	My husband and just went to get a foot massage. But ended up doing 30 min foot and 40 min back. Best massage ever. They did whole body massage. We will back for sure.
__label__5	"Terri and John did a Great job diagnosing and repairing my Firman generator. Glad I have found a friendly and reliable repair service. 
Try The Mower Shop, you won't be disappointed !!!"
__label__5	"Love this place.
Great place to come and eat, listen to live music and have some cocktails"
__label__5	It is a super small place that you might not notice driving by, but worth stopping.  My husband and I came in on a Friday night and we loved the food.  We both had the Fra Diavlo.  The servers were all very friendly and attentive.  The one thing we were weary about was that there was a live singer and, as said above, it is small in there.  But he sung Sinatra songs and was really great.  After awhile we just relaxed and enjoyed.  The decor is really pretty too.
__label__5	"Great food! Fast service! 
Never had a bad steak at outbacks.  I love the bread. I had six ounce steak and all you can eat shrimps. Yum! Yum!"
__label__5	So Pizza Plus is my go to pizza. I've been eating there since the 80's. If you haven't tried them you absolutely should. I gave them a 5 star rating, but honestly  I'm so disappointed because they have always had the BEST steak fries, however tonight I opened up a box of regular fries. They are meh. I'm hoping that this is a freak incident and they ran out of their usual fries. If this is a permanent change I'm going to be so upset.
__label__5	Great place to grab lunch or dinner in downtown Greenwood. Service was quick, food was fabulous, and an had the option of an unlimited amount of yum yum sauce! Mike was friendly and the restaurant had a peaceful atmosphere.
__label__5	I go here for every UFC fight and its awesome.. The food is really good and the people that work are really nice.. KCCO!!!
__label__5	Just had dinner with my wife, as usual both dishes were superb!  My wife had the chicken special, with crabmeat and lobster raviolis, I had the veal sorentino.  Service great,food great. Been here many times and have never been disappointed!
__label__5	This is the best hot chocolate spot I've ever been in! They make hot chocolate with actual chocolate bricks, and the customer service is phenomenal!!! The owner is Mr. Let's Make it Happen and he is so much fun!!!!! I'd recommend this place for everyone to visit at least once in your life!
__label__5	Hands down, the best breakfast sandwiches in Conshy. Call ahead and your order will be ready in 15 minutes. The staff are friendly and it's consistently good. I just wish they were open later on weekdays so I could try the rest of the menu.
__label__5	One of my favorite restaurants in St Louis. Local ingredients, you can taste the difference! The specials are always a good thing to order - they change them often. Service is great and everyone that works there is very knowledgeable.
__label__5	I am fortunate enough to have eaten all over the world and I can safely say that Jaxon is one of the best meals I have ever had. Each dish was better than the next - which, believe me, I didn't think was possible after starting with the muscles and the gnudi. The passion and skill of the people were evident in the food, service, and ambience of this wonderful establishment. I will keep coming back until I'm either dead or broke. And even then, I'll probably ask to wash dishes in exchange for that gnudi.
__label__5	Little Radish was fantastic! And celiac safe!!! Wraps are delicious and the cookies AMAZING.
__label__5	I had been to Indo previously with my mother on her last visit to STL and thoroughly enjoyed our dinner .  So I decided to go for my birthday last event and had the omasake experience. It was amazing. Chef Bognar is an absolute sushi ninja and very nice guy .  This birthday dinner will be one to remember!
__label__5	Wow, talk about responsive and personalized service!   I contacted Jesse (owner) based on o his reputation and they did not disappoint!   The tech made special efforts to accommodate my difficult schedule, came over to assess the situation, gave me the truth and even created a workaround for an appliance that was not meant to operate the way I wanted.  There is no question of this companies ethic's, skill, and willingness to help on a personal level.  I now have a new appliance company!
__label__5	This place is amazing! The food tastes so fresh and the pizza is so good. I heard from people who can't have gluten that they were able to get the pasta or pizza because it's imported from Italy. I can attest that I ate the pasta with NO reaction! that was pretty exciting. Will be coming here again
__label__5	Jim's cheesecteaks is still the best I've ever tasted! I will go out of my eay to get a cheesesteak and fries from Jim's on public transportation! I don't eat many cheesesteaks like I used to do but Jim's is still the best in my opinion. I used to live near the store so I could walk there anytime, but since I don't anymore I will still catch public transportation or UBER to get one. You gotta try it at least once. You  be will become addicted !
__label__5	"Absolutely love this place!

Service is always friendly and welcoming. Their breaded steak tortas are ridiculously good. Everything on the menu is reasonably priced and portions are filling.

Hands down one of my favorite restaurants in the Fletcher Place neighborhood."
__label__5	Amazing. Kebab plate was so good. Pastry basket also really good. More like dessert but fun to split them between the table and try all o them. Favorite was the croissant style one if you're only getting one.
__label__5	Visited New Day Meadery for the first time this past Friday. The husband and I are dry wine drinkers and honestly didn't know what to expect with mead. Well, we were so pleasantly surprised - we are now mead lovers! Wonderful nectar. We also enjoyed the entire experience - the store atmosphere and the owners and the young man that served our mead - everything was lovely!  Can't wait to go back!
__label__5	Basically I can't say anything to top what the other reviewers have posted. Nashville needed a restaurant like this and now it has been delivered. Last night we truly had one of the best dining experiences ever. Everything from the minute we entered to the minute we left was wonderful. Service, food, atmosphere, etc. Awesome!
__label__5	I just moved to the area and my eyebrows needed some serious help. I read the reviews and thought that I would give it a try. The lady did a WONDERFUL job on my brows. She was very thorough. This is definitely my new place. Great experience!
__label__5	Amazing place, the chocolate snow is delicious. The serving size was enough to feed two people.
__label__5	This is one of the finest Starbucks stores I've ever been in. Great location and the service was awesome!
__label__5	Love the ease of access and TSA efficiency.  Then again I can only speak to Southwest areas.  As a HUGE bonus they have a Cigar City cafe in the Southwest gate area.   SAWEEET!
__label__5	We eat breakfast here at 6:30 every Friday morning. The service is awesome, Michelle is always there. She's the best. We often ask for unusual breakfast items, and they always find a way to accommodate us. This is the best diner in Delaware, I think. Burger night on Tuesday is a real bargain. Home made pies are excellent. But breakfast, either on Friday with my friends or Saturday with my wife, is the highlight of my week.
__label__5	I love good bbq and Corky's is one of my favorites in the Nashville area.  I like their sandwiches with slaw.
__label__5	Keke's is the spot! I had a peach Belgium waffle and it was amazing. I wish they were open longer but honestly I can't complain about their food 10/10 experience I hope to return soon.
__label__5	Great find for us in Santa Barbara! The service was great. They brought out fries on the house for our four year old! Pretty cool!
__label__5	"I hired Jorge and his crew to uproot and remove a tree and landscape my entire property. They did a fantastic job. All trimmings and such were cleaned up. I went with this company because of the good reviews. All of the men are hard workers. Excellent job fellas. Gracia.
Frank L."
__label__5	First time here and will definitely not be my last! Got 2 carne asada tacos and the meat was so tender and delicious 10/10! Definitely worth the price and environment there is very social!
__label__5	Boneless ribs are a classic done right. Lunch special is great for like $6 cant beat it
__label__5	Great frozen yogurt you pay for by weight. But it's really the toppings that make it. Everything from nuts, to chocolate to gummy worms...  a fun place to meet friends or make my teenage daughter sit and visit with me :-)
__label__5	"My husband and I had dinner tonight at Thaikuu at the top of Chestnut Hill. The atmosphere was cozy and romantic. The service was great! The food was absolutely delicious!!! For our main dish we had the crab fried rice. The presentation was beautiful and the crab was lump crab.
Highly recommended!"
__label__5	Full bar with friendly bartenders and a great mix of well maintained old and new video and pinball games. They even have little side tables you can slide over by your game to set your drink on while you play.
__label__5	Always good service and good drinks. A nice crowd, where you can chat and enjoy the conversation, or just relax alone.
__label__5	Shane responded quickly to our last-minute request to repair termite damage before we sold our home. His rate was reasonable and quality of work very good. You will find cheaper and faster but likely wind up paying more than Shane in the long run if you need a quality job.
__label__5	This Denny's location is fantastic! It never seems to be too busy but it's still very high quality. Our waitress was highly courteous, very prompt, and very detail-oriented. I would definitely recommend this Denny's to a friend!
__label__5	I have to completely agree with other reviews before me - absolutely fantastic! Oksana knew exactly what she was doing during my aches and pains with aromatherapy session, finding and working every knot (and there were plenty) and the Ashiatsu she incorporated in the end - I was speechless. Honestly, I felt like never before after a deep tissue and have already set another appointment without a Groupon, it is completely worth every penny!
__label__5	This place is amazing! Their food is so fresh. I live 4 minutes away and just discovered this place. My favs are the Soft Shell Crab salad and the Panang Curry chicken. I've already been here twice this week. Too bad I'll be relocating to another state otherwise I'd be here at least once weekly. You've got to give this place a try, I promise you, you won't be disappointed!
__label__5	We came during happy hour and had $1 off margaritas. Also tried the huge nachos, which were amazing, and both specials which featured duck tacos and fried grasshoppers atop cojita cheese. I love places that offer unusual and authentic foods so I really enjoyed Loco Pez!
__label__5	Everyone who assisted me in the service department was kind and polite. That's what mattered most. They provided excellent customer service and made sure I was taken care of. They were the best and I truly appreciated everyone who helped me! Thank you again Darryl, Debbie and Kirk Kratz! God bless you all. Xoxo.
__label__5	I recommend this vet to all of my friends. It is the best clinic I have taken any of my pets to. They are genuine, helpful, understanding and dont judge me for my dog's crazy behavior :) The clinic is clean and organized. The vets are professional and knowlegeable. And they are affordable to boot! They truly are the best vet in town!
__label__5	"Eaten here twice. Both times was outside The Shelter on Grant Rd. Delicious! $8 pizza seems fair for what you get.

Interesting flavor combinations that all seem to work. I've tried 4 of their pies and they are all tasty."
__label__5	"I had a problem with the remote start/entry installed Feb 2014.  I contacted them to let them know, and to inquire about my options.  They let me know that it was under warranty.  I was able to drop it off the night before my appointment for repair.  It was completed within an hour of them opening the next day.  Works like a charm.
Thanks!!! Great job!"
__label__5	Favorite brunch spot in the area. Super friendly and awesome service. Great coffee and food, lots of vegetarian options. My favorite dishes are probably the bagel sandwich, truffled egg toast, and sausage gravy cornbread waffle.
__label__5	Such a great place! Not only can you get a good hot breakfast but you can also do requests such as the pictures I have attached. I called about a mountain of donuts in alternative to a cake for my daughters birthday. The owner was amazing to work with. His ideas were great and so much better than what I had in mind LOL. Would definitely recommend them for any special events. I chose donuts instead of a cake so I wouldn't have to worry about plates, forks and napkins. So glad I chose this donut shop!
__label__5	Another perfect order full filled within timeframe quoted and at a GREAT price.  My handicap van accessible and penalty signs were of good quality and I'm very pleased. Thank you again !
__label__5	Been in a few times to this ridiculously cool speakeasy, and let me tell you it's always a blast! Great cocktails, amazing cigar selection and probably the best pizza in Nashville area! The staff is super knowledge and friendly. If you our on a date and want to impress them, I'd definitely take them here
__label__5	What a wonderful place to eat. They always bring you little pastries that they make each person gets a taste of all of them. Have not tried anything it was good. Their bloody Mary's are wonderful. They give you a large and of course portion to take home.
__label__5	Excellent spa experience. Great care and attention paid to customers. Relaxing atmosphere. Will definitely frequent millennium spa!
__label__5	"Despite the price for food and drinks, which I partake in every now and then, it's worth it! Smaller theater sizes and comfortable seating, makes watching the movie enjoyable. You can choose your seat as well.

I've been hear a number of times, and I have yet found something bad to say. As an added plus for me, it's a  convenient location."
__label__5	"Stayed in Hotel across theStreet for a week and ate here every single Day! Great Food, Fantastic Staff! 
Chicken Caesar Salad is a must! Thumbs up , highly recommended."
__label__5	This is a great place to try Nashville hot chicken. A little sweeter than some other hot chicken stops. Great draft beers!
__label__5	"Need dry ice bring apple hill pies to Southern California and then 25 gallons worth of ice cream from Los Angeles back to Reno? ... or just to have dry ice. This is the spot. I wasted time going everywhere that ""sold"" dry ice to be told they didn't have any yet (waiting for delivery). Just come straight here, have proper protective gloves and Styrofoam box or igloo with crumpled newspaper or towels."
__label__5	Super good quality, affordable sushi. Definitely good for like a lunch time spot or catching up with a friend. I got the special three rolls for $13 and everything was delicious. My dad got the lunch box which was $16 and he got so much food. Neither of us drank because we're doing dry January but the drinks also look phenomenal. The bar was fully stocked which we appreciate and we will be back after this month!
__label__5	Such a great spot! Date night. Family night. Ladies night. It's great for everyone. We really enjoy going for Taco Tuesday's.
__label__5	Oh lord.  Everything is great. Crazy things like fried bologna sandwiches and deep-fried pot pie are not to be missed. Same people as Molly's Rise and Shine.
__label__5	This place is amazing. Great food and great customer service! I love any and all of their dishes, but the chicken and rice bowl is my favorite.
__label__5	The place was absolutely amazing all around. The food was well seasoned, and definitely worth a try. They even catered to the English speaking customers by providing an English version of the menu. Very friendly staff also.
__label__5	"Professional, knowledgeable, and super friendly staff.
Great looking office & always clean.
Dr Christine is the BEST dentist!"
__label__5	This place is pretty incredible! If you enjoy horses, this will be heaven for you! We came for a couple nights but could stay a week without getting bored. There are various riding options for your morning or afternoon rides, a heated pool, hot tub, game room, theater and more. The food is great and the staff members are fantastic. We came here with our ten year old and he didn't want to leave! Don't bring fancy clothes...just jeans and boots are all you need!
__label__5	Working with Carl Alan was incredible! Vito was right on point with what I wanted! The flowers were beautiful and everything I could ask for. Vito made appointments so easy and fun. There are so many choices and details you can pick. I was lucky to work with someone who could help me sort through it all with ease. I LOVED my flowers day of!
__label__5	We had such a great time! 100% recommend! Our Cemetary tour guide Robert was really informative, friendly, funny, and really conscious of other tours, loud traffic, sunlight in your eyes. Really a great tour, we learned a lot and enjoyed all the outside info too!
__label__5	Yuuuuum! I've been looking for a good spot here in Sparks and I've found it in Haveli. If you want some good rice dishes and spicy, delicious sauces this is the place.
__label__5	"Pho Noodle has become our go-to neighborhood spot for Asian food, whether we dine in and enjoy generous bowls of pho loaded with fresh veggies or we order a couple of lunch specials to-go. Their prices are very reasonable for the consistent quality I've experienced and service is prompt and polite. Beware of the weekday business lunch crowd and either call in your order a little early or seat yourself prior to reaching your ""hangry"" point!"
__label__5	"Not sure what the Mike guy was talking about but I was just at this Hooters and the WiFi was kicking but with both a 5GHz and 2.4GHz option and full bars and my download speeds were screaming fast. Sounds like user error to me. Stay off the sites that give you malware and slow down your internet. lol

Food was great and so was service as always!"
__label__5	"I love beverage depot for all my at home alcohol needs. 
The customer service is quick and helpful. 
I especially appreciate that they keep kegs in stock for people like me that plan parties last minute. They have a huge selection of liquor and wine."
__label__5	Stopped by here to get some food and wow their fries are good. A nice wasabi flavored mayo with sprinkles of seaweed and seasoning. A box full of them for $5 is such a steal. Come stop by here and say hello to the two friendly owners of this little business.
__label__5	I live right around the corner from here and do my laundry nextdoor on the weekends. I have noticed the increased foot traffic because of the the coffee shop. Decided to check it out for myself today. I ended up getting a perfect iced coffee and some great conversation along with it. I hope it continues to get more business and stick around.
__label__5	I've been coming for about a year now, and can't say enough how thrilled I am with this salon. Clean, professional, an all around great experience Everyone is so nice and Andy does a fantastic job every time! If you have been searching for a salon, or are unhappy with your current one, I highly recommend Brio!!
__label__5	I come to Nashville often and after spending NYE here (and lunch the next day) I can say that I will DEFINTELY be back each trip! Best spot on broadway with the highest rooftop!
__label__5	Yes pricey but convenient and it's a small family owned store not a huge selection but past, friendly, clean, cute, and convenient.
__label__5	Very kool place. The food was simple but yummy. Nice vibe as well. Super busy, but this means one thing-good!
__label__5	I was in Tucson on Saturday for an event for my company and decided to stop in after seeing a lot of good yelp reviews. It was a good decision! Great food & very prompt & positive service. I would definitely recommend this restaurant.
__label__5	Great location, great atmosphere... great drinks and amazing food. The outdoor dining area was perfect. The managers Steve & Steve are the BEST. Do yourself a favor and check this place out. We will be back soon. Five stars and 2 thumbs up!
__label__5	"Wow, where have these guys been hiding out all this time. Always dealt with the ""big guys"" in town, but not anymore. The brothers were as professional and experienced as it gets and their rates were also very reasonable. As five stars as five stars gets."
__label__5	I absolutely love stopping by here anytime I am in town. I've debated on moving to NPR just to be in delivery range of this place! Lol. Great lunch specials. 2 big slices and a soda for 4.99. Best pizza in town.
__label__5	"After a long jaunt around the French quarter we found the three muses at the recommendation of an Anthony Bourdain episode. 

We loved the live music and the pork belly was insane. Our daughter was a big fan of the band that night and we both really enjoyed ourselves"
__label__5	Ate hear for the first time and I will be back! Neat little place , very clean and the service was great, not to mention my Waffle was delicious!
__label__5	"Fast, fresh and tastes great!!

Had the houseblend burger and it was awesome!  The tomatoes were deep red and very fresh.  The hamburger was cooked to perfection, like they actually listened to how I wanted it - not so common at other restaurants.

The house made chips were also very good!

We WILL be back!"
__label__5	"I did Dolphin Tour on Sunday last week and me and my wife simply loved it.
We booked it through Groupon, both Captain and Crew member was simply awesome. In 90 min tour driver indeed took us to many spots where we encountered several dolphins and not to forgot the best dolphin jump captured on our camera :)"
__label__5	Wow..SO happy we found this place. Shared the crispy calamari... best ever. The bed of arugula and corn went so well with it. I had the VEGGIE POT PIE..to die for! The gravy was so creamy and delicious. The crust was good and the vegetables were fresh and yummy! And I had a house salad...not your typical crappy house salad. Everything was fresh and delicious we scarfed it down!
__label__5	This company has knowledgeable, friendly, and competent technicians as well as amazing Customer Service. I got a call from the office (after they had closed) to let me know that the technician had gotten delayed on a previous job but would still come to fix my problem.   I have used other companies in the way past, but they do not even come close to providing the personalized, professional service of Michaelson's. Always very responsive and pleasant as well as professional and competent.
__label__5	I love this place. What an amazing selection of burgers. Always leave feeling like I'm in a food coma. I just wish they had nacho cheese for their tater tots!!!
__label__5	Great service! I walked-in and there was no wait time. The nail technician was so kind and my nails looked very nice. Just what I was looking for. Will go back for pedicure next. Highly recommend this place.
__label__5	"Fantastic services offered here. 
The spa is exceptional and is the perfect place to relax. 

I attend Pilates and yoga classes and think the instructors are A+ level. The personal trainers are great, Steve is talented as hell! 

Never too busy and love the amenities. 

My second home."
__label__5	Friendly staff. Stayed open late for us. Lots of colors to choose from. Quality service. 100% would recommend.
__label__5	Oh my goodness, this is the BEST BEST Asian place. Fabulous food (seriously, everything is made, plated and served with care and high quality) great drinks, fantastic dessert. My only problem is that there are no alcoholic drinks, so it's not someplace I can bring colleagues for dinner.
__label__5	Pure deliciousness! I expected the waffle to be kind of hard on  the outside like most Belgian waffles but mannnnn...this waffle was soft, warm and fluffy not to mention filled with cookies and cream ice cream!  The best Belgiian waffle Ive had hands down (and not because of the ice cream lol)
__label__5	Family owned and super friendly, we got the white pie with spinach. Yum!! Tony has been here for 51 years.
__label__5	OMG!!! Came nearby for work for one day and can't tell you enough about this place. This small mom and pop ice cream place has unique and exceptional flavors that will get your tastebuds sending a chill through your whole body. From the moment your start eating your ice cream, you want to savor every moment. I got the corn and avocado ice cream and topped it with chili powder and they are both amazing flavors. Everyone should at least sample it even though they do not like corn or avocado.
__label__5	Saw the web site had nothing to lose so gave the guy a call.  He asked a few questions and gave me a price.  I agreed to the price and he said he would be here within the next few days.  Three hours later he showed up, did the work and charged me less than what he quoted.  Good guy, good work, could not have been better unless he brought a cold six pack and dinner.
__label__5	"If you need to get your car smogged, GO HERE! All the guys were super nice, and the smog guy, I believe his name is Scott, was rad. He's crazy fast..I was in and out of there in under 10 minutes. The price was amazing..way cheaper than a lot of places I was researching. Out the door price $35.95 with certification; they give you a $2 discount off that if you pay in cash. 
Great and fast service, friendly attitudes, and great pricing. Highly recommend!!"
__label__5	Excellent experience all around! My car was hit, and it was my first time dealing with insurance. Errol was easy to communicate with, helpful, and patient as I navigated the claims process. He had my smacked-up car looking new n' spiffy within 7 days and at a very reasonable price too. Top notch service and great work! Highly recommended!
__label__5	If you want amazing REAL Mexican food - this is the place. Just like what I grew up on. Very nice owners and staff. You feel like you're going to an old friend. I come here far too often.
__label__5	By far the best meal I have had in a long time. The potato gnocchi were pillowy soft and bursting with flavor. The NY strip cooked to perfection and paired perfectly with potato purée and beet sauce. Exceeded all of my expectations! Don't forget dessert...the deconstructed brownie had me closing my eyes with joy. We will be back!
__label__5	"Really appreciate how helpful the staff is and how nice they are!!

They always seem happy to see customers which is not always the vase at their nearby competitors (you figure out who).  There is typically a young lady named Cortni there who is especially customer service oriented and is a pleasure to work with!  Kudos to this location for training and working with their staff!!!"
__label__5	Very good sandwiches.  I ate here for lunch everyday while visiting the near by hospital.  Everything about this place was awesome.
__label__5	Wonderful food and GREAT service! Classy restaurant great atmosphere. The veal is amazing!
__label__5	Breakfast at the Decatur St location in The Big Easy. Very busy, hip atmosphere, all ages represented, hangovers, cool soundtrack. That alone was worth the 20 minute wait. Ordered the pancake flight, steel cut oats, sides of fruit and pecans, and coffee. All excellent and well presented. The pancakes were delicious on their own; no syrup required or desired! Pecans were a great addition though. Oats cooked perfectly. Highest recomendation, will recommend to others, and will return again in the future.
__label__5	Here something I don't get these guys only have 3 stars but has been professional and courteous on their part. I called another company who was supposed to tow mine automobile to a location that I made sure I gave them the correct address. Well it didn't make you they would not fix the situation , so John's towing who took over and did the job for me and no cost.  Don't bother about calling anybody else John towing is the one you need.
__label__5	We love Ohana, my wife and I have had sushi at almost every place in Reno and this is hands down the best AYCE in town. The rolls are always fresh and flavorful, the service is on point, quick, and accurate, and the staff is friendly and they work well as a team to provide a great customer experience. Side note, I've never been a fan of fruity rolls until I had their rolls, the Honolulu has had my mouth watering for the last few weeks.
__label__5	Most delicious and tastiest flavors I have ever had! Fruit Loopz and Berry Dream are my favorite flavors! The flavors of the week is a great idea for being able to get a 50ml for 12 bucks! The staff is super friendly and helpful! If anyone is looking for a place to go or even a new place to go, I would definitely try this place out! Military discounts and amazing flavors!
__label__5	Fantastic place for nails and wax.  Hannah, Kim, and Jessica are wonderful. Never let you leave without being satisfied.
__label__5	So happy I stopped in this place. They carry EVERY type of natural dog food you can imagine. I have had a hard time finding merrick since I moved to Florida so I have been ordering online. Yes the price is a little higher then online but if I'm in a pinch I know where I can go.
__label__5	Fantastic! Just go here. Bright, clean, food is excellent. Nice attentive waitstaff. It's SO good.
__label__5	Best seafood and there artichokes are fabulous.  Can't get enough.  The staff is very helpful and kind   Always get my seafood from them.  Thank you Dennis' Seafood
__label__5	"amazing food in fantastic service. I ate here two nights in a row. Once a loan, and once with a friend. The service is ultra-fast and could not be more friendly. The food is freaking awesome. one night I had the carne asada which could not have been more perfectly seasoned. The other night I had shredded chicken enchiladas. Chips and salsa also perfect.

Everyone in the restaurant is carefully observing the covid-19 safety precautions."
__label__5	I went their to get brunch for my husband and myself. Everyone there was so nice and accommodating. The food was fantastic! Service was stellar!
__label__5	Come and see some great history and maybe a spirit or 2!! The tour is fantastic and Dawn is a great informative tour guide. Definitely worth checking it out and very affordable!
__label__5	"Never have to twist my arm to head here.  Atmosphere is great, front of house are approachable and helpful.  Back of house are wizards.

Seriously, the kitchen is working magic.  Pick anything on the menu.  The staple hot chicken to the ribs, killer brunch and sides that will make you reconsider what you would have for your final meal.

Bravo to Grace for providing STL with a dose of what protein aspires to be.

You owe yourself a meal here."
__label__5	Went here with a group due to the proximity to the theater last night and it was fantastic! There is something on the menu for everyone, especially considering the staff will special make just about any meal to accommodate. The staff was very friendly and the food was extremely well done, I will be making a point to return very soon!
__label__5	"Hurricane Eddies was remodeled after a fire destroyed the previous bar called the Inn.... I must say I was shocked by how much detail and work went into remodeling it. There is no food yet but that is coming very soon.. the drink prices a great... the staff is just so friendly and attentive to their customers...... what a gem this place is.......
                       THIS IS A DO NOT MISS!!!!!!!

__label__5	Excellent service. These guys explained everything that was going on with my car and they were very helpful. Highly recommend this place.
__label__5	The falafel, eggplant, and caramelized onion hummus with balsamic dressing are Amazing!!  Customer service has been great and the staff is very nice and accommodating if you have any concerns.  Look forward to eating here at least weekly.
__label__5	Hello my name is Karen and I really had a great experience at Bobby's Burger Palace the food was awesome the service was great the general manager witch I had the pleasure of meeting Ms. Kimberly Green was very knowledgeable and professional and the other manager Nicole was so SUPER also the certainly went the extra mile. My turkey burger, fries and sweet potato fries was awesome I give it 5 stars and 2 thumbs up.
__label__5	Thank you Palmer for great service and the recommendations for dinner and drinks. The honeysuckle & lavender flip was awesome
__label__5	Burgers from anywhere else do not compare! Absolutely the best in and around Tampa. Whether you try the 3 Pigs, Goober, Kicker or one of countless others, you won't ever attempt to eat a burger somewhere else again.
__label__5	"A truly amazing store. Greg and all of his staff are sensationally friendly and as helpful as can be. I purchased an engagement ring having done only minimal research, but Greg made the entire process simple. He explained, in detail, exactly what I should be looking for, while always keep my needs and budget first. I came away with an absolutely beautiful diamond ring. Most importantly, she said ""Yes!"" and she loves her ring."
__label__5	I just had my hair cut by Ben and it was hands down the best salon experience I've ever had. Not only did Ben listen closely to what I wanted, he was a super fun and down to earth guy and he paid extremely close attention to detail which ultimately resulted in an amazing cut/color that I'm super happy with. Also, the overall atmosphere of the salon was amazing. It's super clean and modern and you definitely feel welcome from the second you walk in. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR MEN AND WOMEN.
__label__5	Came here for s Yelp event and the food was great! I am doing Whole 30 with a friend and there wet tons of yummy options for us. We got the kale, grilled chicken and sides of brussel sprouts and sweet potato mash. The grilled chicken was delicious. I don't know how they cook it but it was juicy and tasty. Really enjoyed the brussel sprouts a lot as well. Thank you Yelp and Herban Eats for a great night!
__label__5	Such good food, and the perfect spot for lunch. The blackened crawfish side dish is a must!
__label__5	Great breakfast and coffee, and incredibly friendly service.
__label__5	Great place and great food. All food is authentic and they even have food you can come in and pick up if you are in a hurry.
__label__5	I came here last week and was very happy with my service. First of all the building is beautiful, very white and clean on the inside. My stylist was very nice and knowledgeable, and her teacher was very helpful when needed. If I thought she didn't understand what I was asking for I just made sure to have a conversation with her about it to be clear, and my hair ended up exactly the color and cut that I wanted. I would definitely recommend!
__label__5	"Words cannot describe how amazing this place is. This may be a little hole in the wall but it's a hole to paradise. I tried this place with a friend of mine and while eating it I forgot his name and could only call him ""dude"". My tastebuds were given a ride to pleasure island courtesy of chef oya. You know the meal is amazing when you just sit there after eating questioning why it took you so long to unlock your full potential. Highly recommend taking your tastebuds here and unleashing the glorious deliciousness of The Trap"
__label__5	Took a friend for her birthday dinner.  No reservations but they were able to find us seating at the bar.  The clam chowder was amazing!!  I got the duck which could be the best duck I have ever had and my friend got the swordfish.  Both of the dishes were wonderful.  You must end your dinner with the doughnuts! Can't wait to go back and try more dishes.
__label__5	Please don't go with anyone else. Kenneth is excellent and will work on your case. I was happy that he was able to help me with my speeding ticket. He is good at what he does. I didn't have to make the 4hr drive to go see him or go to court. He made my life very easy.  I highly recommend his firm.
__label__5	"Such an awesome place!  I actually look forward to working out again and it has everything to do with this place.  The atmosphere is motivating and friendly, the instructors are EXCELLENT, the classes are very challenging, and overall they really care about their customers.  

I've had a wonderful experience here and will miss it tremendously as I am moving out of the area.  

Try it and you will LOVE it!!!"
__label__5	My go to place in the CBD for lunch. Fast, fresh and always consistent. Very happy they've hit their stride.
__label__5	We came in to get a new Volt for me and left with the Volt as well as traded in my husbands truck for a new one! Everyone, from the cashier to the courtesy driver, to the sales people and the lead mechanic, are incredibly accommodating and helpful. We are a Bunnin family now!
__label__5	Diem and her team are the absolute best! I've been going to Diem for years to get my hair done (even before she opened this salon), and since then I've always received numerous compliments on my hair. The salon is very cute and comfortable too, when you're in there you'll quickly feel at ease and ready to relax while getting pampered. =)
__label__5	One of the best dessert shops I have been ever been to. We got the smores skillet with pistashio gelatto and the cassis. Both were delicious with a perfect balance of all flavors. The service was outstanding and easy to get in and out unlike other places in the French quarter.
__label__5	Coctails and an entree dish are a must. Craft cocktails are strong and tasty. Entree dishes are best, large, flavorful, and also a great variety of tastes.
__label__5	Great place for a real homemade breakfast. French toast was amazing. My boyfriend had the Ham and cheese omlette and just loved it. Our server Angelina was perfect. Very friendly and was there when we needed anything.
__label__5	I have been coming to A Taste of China since I was a little girl. I have tried almost everything they have and the quality is superb! Throughout the years one would think the business would have changed portion size, altered the recipes and/ or the menu but they have not. This is hands down the best Chinese place in St. Louis!
__label__5	"Great experience.   The food was amazing, loved all the options.   The service was good, the gouchos came quickly and as often as your 'green light' wanted.  Very comfortable atmosphere.  
It can be a little pricey once you add cocktails and dessert but definitely worth it!!!
I valet parked, only $10 versus $20 at a nearby lot."
__label__5	Really nice place to eat, the food is solid and it is reasonably priced.  The desserts would be my only complaint, not great.  The bread is really good that they serve beforehand, and I don't live close enough to frequent this place, but if I did live closer, I would definitely go in often.  i also like the atmosphere, it is fancy, but also quiet and elegant at the same time.  I was impressed with the variety of the menu, service, and quality of the food.  Good food, good prices, not sure what else you could want from a restaurant.
__label__5	"Eat continues to amaze.  Have been there for brunch several times over the years and it never fails.  

Great, friendly service.  Delicious and creative food.  Awesome atmosphere.

Highly recommend."
__label__5	For the first time having an event that I didn't cook myself, having Just To Serve You cater my daughters baby shower was professional, punctual, and presented well. The food was fantastic, everyone ate with such pleasure and lots of compliments. For catering, this is the restaurant I will use from now on. They were priced fair and they did what they said they would do. This experience has been a great first time for many more to come. Thank you, Just To Serve You, you served well!
__label__5	Finally made it to this restaurant, had the guac, yum!  Hubby had the Mariachi Platter (burrito, quesadilla, taco, tostata with rice and beans) and a flight of tequila, I had the chicken chimichanga, so light and flaky with lots of cheese and flavor.  Finished with the flan.  Highly recommend and will definitely return.
__label__5	Found this gem in a plaza up the street from my office and I couldn't be more happy. Their lunch specials are great, the service is always fantastic, and everything I've had has always been on point. My favorite roll is the lobster dynamite. It's MASSIVE!!!! Hands down my favorite roll of all time.
__label__5	Fabulous food and atmosphere!  Nice variety of Italian dishes; pasta, fish, veal, chicken. Something for everyone. This was our first visit and it was delicious! You won't be disappointed. We will be back and we'll save room for dessert too.
__label__5	If you're looking for authentic North Indian cuisine this is the place! Nothing short of amazing, from the food to the service. As a hardcore foodie this place serves as the closest reminder to the food back in Delhi. You won't be disappointed, hands down the best Indian restaurant in the bay.
__label__5	Wife and I went for for drinks great service look forward to the food next time! Great selection of greek brandy
__label__5	All my kids are worth O'Gara Orthodontics. The best staff. Great results. And Dr. O'Gara is the best in town. I won't recommend anyone else.
__label__5	Rebecca and Sarah with Better Life are great! I finally felt like my house was clean when they left. And I so appreciate not having to worry about what they are using to clean. Thank you!
__label__5	Last year I was at the same place and few days ago went to the same place...... still one of the best massage that someone can get.
__label__5	This was my favorite place pre-COVID but it has become even more so post COVID. The outside tent allows for socially distanced dining and, when indoor dining was allowed, the tables were nicely spaced. The food and the service are always topnotch. I love the pasta specials and the pasta bolognese the most but everything on the menu is delicious. I am going to host a baby shower here!
__label__5	"Wow wow wow!   This is truly THE MUST RETURN TO restaurant! Hugs and cheer for a magical and memorable evening....to the staff from the hostesses thru the most fantasmic server and cooks!

We tried the lamb burger and chicken truffle cheese mac.  Totally delicious!

Each trip to Indianapolis will always include our return!"
__label__5	"What an amazing experience! I have not had true, expertly done deli food since leaving NYC. Everything our server brought to the table was wonderful--salad, Sable platter, etc. And my sandwich? A mountain of corned beef, pastrami and swiss that will keep me in lunches for most of the week! A ""slice"" of carrot cake (that was, I swear, larger than my first NY apartment) topped off the meal.

Best part can be summed up in two little words: Pickle Bar.

I'm in love people."
__label__5	My favorite taco joint hands down. One may consider me a tacoaholic as well. ;) street corn is also the best I have had so far.
__label__5	Great place to get a hair cut. Amy and Mike both do a wonderful job at cutting my kids hair. Best prices in town also $9 men's cut. If Amy has time and she knows you as a returning customer you get a nice little shoulder/neck message too. Love taking the boys there and and sneaking next door for some good egg rolls for $3.
__label__5	A little crowded on the inside but the food is absolutely amazing. I had the ravioli di ricotta and it was amazing. My friend ordered the gnocchi and it was just as good. staff was very friendly and not too expensive. Portions were the perfect size. Cannot recommend enough will definitely be going back soon!
__label__5	What a great little find in downtown Philly...just a few blocks off of Broad Street.  Be sure and check the board for their specials.  Generous portions, good food and great service.
__label__5	Came here while out of town and I am so happy I found this gem! It's so beautiful and clean. Wish I had a nail salon back at home in south Florida who could offer this kind of exceptional service. The manicure I had done was the best and it wasn't rushed although they had clients waiting. For sure an A+
__label__5	Wow, what a great place. Not only is the food fantastic but the customer service couldn't be any better. I will go back again and again.
__label__5	Got the Franks extra hot wings, they were exactly how I like them, spicey with flavor and no breading.  Wings were on the bone by the pound, about 10ish wings half and half mix of the first and second wing sections.  Nicely cooked with no dried out sections.  Great compliment to the UFC fight. Service was quick and attentive on a moderately busy night.  Meal was taken at the bar since the tables were full and I was by myself.
__label__5	I was very happy with the entire experience. The guys were fast and strong, prompt, and no items were damaged. I used David and his guys for two separate moves, and on both dates I was very satisfied. Great job!
__label__5	"The good folks from Pineapple Rice took over back in December and the food is amazing!

They make the best hot and sour soup and lo mein!  All the reviews from prior to December are for the old place - go enjoy the best chinese Clearwater has to offer!"
__label__5	"We took the charter bus yesterday and what was a little over an hour drive took nine hours due to the severe weather and major car accidents. Our driver clearly had to endure so much but he handled the situation so well and got us all there safely. I really can't say enough how much he had to go through and how well he dealt with the situation. Thank you!! 
It was a good lesson to always bring water, snacks, and a fully charged phone."
__label__5	Amazing food, delicious cocktails, great beer selection and wonderful service. Our server Lauren had great recommendations which ultimately led to the best meal we've had in Reno.
__label__5	Local fave. Great food. I love everything on the menu. Sake Dave's and Babcock Pinot are my faves.
__label__5	"Another great Sunday brunch place in the SoBro area. ""The Kitchen Sink"" was delicious!"
__label__5	this store is so great when your starting over do to a crisis in life house burning down or bed bug invasion. there furniture people say is high priced isnt really most of the time they clean out every thing inspect treat with a chemical for bed bugs just in case they go throw a process that is also time consuming to make sure your getting a good value and nice pieces. also they do give resources they are a caring store over all.
__label__5	Awesome little cheese and meat shop!  The owner is knowledgable and very nice.  Great customer service and good selection of cheeses!
__label__5	Best bar around STL Especially for People watching.
__label__5	The food was amazing & service was fantastic as well. We made reservations, but it didn't appear to be too busy for walk ins. Try the ribeye, you'll be glad you did!
__label__5	I LUV having a bike store in Spanish Springs!! I'm very delayed in writing this..as I was a visitor to this store about every 2-3 days this past Summer with constant flat tire issues and numerous questions! They are ALL soooo helpful and friendly and didn't make me feel dumb for asking so many questions!! Thank you!!
__label__5	We needed flowers on the same day and we weren't disappointed. Friendly, creative,  reasonable pricing and efficient. Overall pleasant experience and everyone who saw the arrangements commented on how beautiful it is.
__label__5	Great spot for meeting with family or watching a game. Fun corn hole game set up outside. Prompt service and the food was great.
__label__5	Best mimosa in the world. Just saying... The thing about this place that it has ambiance that no other breakfast restaurant in Reno has. The owners were personal and the food was delicious. Thanks guys
__label__5	Love the food and the staff!! The tom kha soup is amazing.  I highly recommend eating here and sitting outside in the hut!!
__label__5	The food was absolutely amazing! So was the staff so friendly! Especially our waitress Tina!!! Amazing place!
__label__5	I thought I'd try Christian Brothers after receiving a mailer and needed an oil change and my brakes checked.  I called and got an appointment quickly.  They were very professional and explained my needed repair.  Very nice to have the shuttle service and I was very satisfied with my repair.  Would definitely use them again.
__label__5	Marvin did an awesome job on my iPad! I had cracked the glass and he fixed it quickly! I can't say enough good things about this small business . His location is very convenient.
__label__5	We stopped by here for a working lunch. This location is a typical sports bar. Pretty waitresses, good beer, plenty of TVs, and a lot of fried food and burgers. The food quality here is really good when comparing to other typical sports bars like Ale House or Dockside.
__label__5	This one worker with glasses is such a hard working lil boy, he made me feel welcomed at this restaurant. The food was delicious and the price was not even that bad. Would come again 10/10
__label__5	Incredibly knowledgeable, a touch theatric but never cheesy, authentic southern not a New York transplant fake.  Jon cares about the city, knows the city, and conducts his tours at a top notch level.  We learned about deep cut creepy history.  Absolutely loved it.
__label__5	Great chinese restaurant for a great price.  The pan fried noodles are a bit soupy for my taste, but everything else is great.  If you want something that is not on the menu, they are happy to accommodate you if they can, which they usually can.  The dim sum is handmade and delicious.
__label__5	So glad I found this location for eyebrow threading! I've only been here on weekdays and the longest I have ever had to wait was maybe 2 min! Every time I've come in service has been quick, pleasant and as painless as eyebrow threading can be lol Will most definitely keep coming back!
__label__5	"I love the tripa tacos! Someone else had the pastor burrito and liked it. These guys are authentic, just wish they still delivered! 

Maybe a minimum order / delivery fee would make it worthwhile? 

In any case we will be back!"
__label__5	We just ate at Asian Wok for the first time and really enjoyed our meal. The food was fresh. I ordered Mongolian beef and, since I don't really like spicy food, asked for it to be made not so spicy. My meal was perfect. My husband ordered a beef dish with scallops and he enjoyed his meal as well. The restaurant seemed to be very clean and the staff members wore masks while we were present. The restaurant appears to be family owned with all the family members helping. They provided great service! We will visit again! Thanks for a wonderful dinner.
__label__5	This company has been fantastic to work with!  From the staff working the phones and all the service techs I've encountered over the years!  Today Fred came within the times promised ( I was even called twice by the office to let me know he was on his way!  Complete system installed 5 years ago!  Very happy with install!   Fred was servicing my control panel today and explained everything in detail to address a recent fan shut off.  Could not say enough about his professionalism!   Will continue to recommend them!!
__label__5	The Vet is really nice. Doesn't try to push stuff you don't need on you.
__label__5	Great vibe and concept. Right in the heart of the arts district.  And a 3 minute walk from my place = good stuff.
__label__5	"Great for lunch! 

FOOD: 

Galbi lunchbox: It was delicious and came with bon chon (sides) and 2 mini dumplings and strawberries! It's hard to find good galbi and this place definitely gets it right. 

Galbitang soup: It is quite pricey but the broth was great if you love this dish. 

---

RESTAURANT:

Service: Very timely and the Korean lady was so kind

Atmosphere: Cute wooden booths to sit at and a very relaxed environment."
__label__5	Traveling through Philadelphia for business trying to get home during the Blizzard of 2016. We got snowed in at this Hampton Inn, staff was very friendly, they even provided lunch and dinner the blizzard. I was very impressed how they kept the guests comfortable during the snow emergency.
__label__5	This is my favorite restaurant. Try the shrimp fundido, red mesa salad and the cedar roasted salmon.
__label__5	They were so nice and the waffles and coffee were great! Great atmosphere and vibes as well as a kind staff
__label__5	Coat Check elevated! I didn't think coffee and atmosphere could get better then Coat Check and then Provider happen. I absolutely love what Coat Check and Provider bring to Indy. Such amazing staff, drinks and food! They really can do no wrong. If you haven't tried one of their speciality lattes you're missing out! Run, don't walk!
__label__5	Just purchased a 500L this last Saturday. We are very pleased with the three people we worked with. Katherine our first contact, Chuck who helped with the delivery and Kevin who is the main man i.e. (Manger) We got a heck of a deal  Would I / we go back and do it again? Heck yeah!
__label__5	Karaoke was the best. Everyone was friendly to the tourists! (Me) Close to all the restaurants downtown.
__label__5	I was fortunate enough to be invited to the soft opening and was absolutely delighted with the food and the service.  I only just got on yelp, so I'm adding a review here, but honestly all I remember was the food was spectacular, every bite, and I loved the decor as well.
__label__5	Mo made my pizza manifest in real time - his moves were smooth, his advice kind, yet trenchant. Soon I found myself absorbed in a pleie of redoubtable competence. Upon tasting our creation, I burst into a eurythmics ecstasy not seen in common hours. First time customer. Lifelong friend. Don't just eat pizza - get Blazed.
__label__5	AUTHENTIC Indian Cuisine!  We ordered Tandoori chicken and Chicken Tikka Masala with plain Naan.  The flavors were outstanding!  Absolutely takes me back to being in the Indian restaurants while visiting Punjab.  Whenever we are in the area, this will be one of our go to restaurants!
__label__5	Great customer service, super polite and patient.  The donuts are delicious! Would highly recommend going there! The staff was great and kind to my nephews and made it a wonderful experience.
__label__5	"Newer Hampton Inn in South St. Louis and this is the level of comfort and layout which has become the standard for recently built Hampton's. Clean and engaging, with a friendly welcome and engaging staff - if you need a place to stay for a night or 4, this is a solid choice. Rooms are well appointed and spacious and the building still has a fresh and inviting smell - does not smell like stale carpet and desperation. 

Standard Hampton breakfast - it will fuel you - but it is not gourmet. 

All in all - a delightfully well-kept and functional location."
__label__5	This place is awesome! The owner Dan is super nice and accommodating! Such a nice addition to downtown Boise! Welcome paddles up poke! Great food
__label__5	Chrys is an amazing massage therapist.  I would recommend Elements and their therapist - top notch.
__label__5	Incredible hotdogs, great for any meal, but particularly satisfying for a late night nosh.
__label__5	Phenomenal service and the food was top quality! Would recommend to anyone local or outside of Philly!! We got the caterpillar, izumi, and spider roll plus the beef short ribs and tempura shrimp. Lots of variety in food and love the ambiance of the indoor and outdoor seating.
__label__5	Just had my first appointment at Bobby Mack & Co Hair Studio and I am so happy with everything! The salon is gorgeous with a modern and clean look. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. Erin cut and styled my hair and she knew exactly what to do and what would look best on me.  She did an amazing job and I am extremely happy with everything! I made my next appointment in four months and I am looking forward to it!  Thanks again! :)
__label__5	Came here for a bachelorette dinner and it was a really cool vibe. I really enjoyed the combo plate and my friend really liked her chicken burrito bowl. Margaritas were really good but pretty pricey. Pitcher was almost $50. Would come back!
__label__5	Waiter Eddy was super nice! I ordered the stuffed shrimp and my boyfriend got the chicken Caesar wrap with a Beamsicle! The drink wasn't too strong and had a nice orange flavor. Didn't take long for our food to arrive and good atmosphere, would go back!
__label__5	Cracker Mac and Cheese is outrageous. So is the bologna sandwich. Staff is fun and professional. I've been back each time I'm in STL and I recommend to others. Great location near Forest Park and WashU.
__label__5	A Broad Ripple classic! Service is always fantastic and friendly and food comes out quickly. My favorite is a side of rice and beans with queso on top.
__label__5	Delicious pho steak soup and yellow curry chicken. And really great Taro Milk Tea with Boba. Definitely a find.
__label__5	Went on Saturday evening and it was absolutely amazing; friendly staff and exceptional service even though the server did forget to bring our bread until we asked for it; very apologetic; martinis are 2-4-1 which is a plus  next time we will try the pizza
__label__5	Fantastic coffee! And they offer all sorts of vegan alternatives for milk. Everything in moderation, since coconut is not actually produced locally. I like the oat option... these days simply not consuming animal product to be environmentally friendly (and animal friendly) is the beginning. Live and eat local!
__label__5	Great barbeque of all kinds. Our party got tacos, a pulled pork sandwich, and the nachos. All three plates were delicious. The line was long, but moved quickly, and our plates arrived at our table in no time. The patio area was a nice place to sit.
__label__5	"I had Sterling come out recently and take care of my master bedroom, living room, stairs, and loft. My puppies were in heat for the previous 2 weeks and they had gone crazy all over the house marking things up. It wasn't pretty.

Sterling came in and in less than 2 hours had the place looking super spiffy again! They even arrived early! No upsells or bait and switch, which is tough to find nowadays.

Big thanks to your team and great job! I Highly recommend them!"
__label__5	Communication was a little rough between Keith and I, both on my part and his. But we got a date set, the price was more than fair and I am 100%satisfied. Sal did an amazing job, was very professionally courteous and I will absolutely use them again.
__label__5	I really enjoyed this place.  I cant comment on anything but the sandwiches.  They are tasty.  I will be back
__label__5	Unbelievable.   Soooooo amazing.  Really glad we stayed in an Airbnb nearby and wandered over last night.  They were crazy accommodating when we showed up as a 4 top with no reservations.  Everything we had was a perfect blend of flavors and textures with awesome bevvys to top it off.  Highly highly recommend the octopus appetizer, lamb shank entre, and the tri tip linguini dish.  So so good!
__label__5	Loved this place!! Will definitely be back!! Clearwater is one is my favorite places and I'm so glad i found my new favorite place to eat.
__label__5	"I live in Tampa for 28 years and just found this BBQ treasure 

If you like Ribs there is the place to go"
__label__5	"Best Skirt Steak i've ever had. 
we went for my friends birthday & we had an amazing time

the cheese appetizer is amazing. 
the sampler plate is great too. 
so happy."
__label__5	Once again, a wonderful experience. I showed up with a disturbing sound, worried about what was causing it. I jokingly asked them to find something small! Well, they did. They diagnosed a random rock was bopping around, making all that noise.  With it removed, I was on my way, no charge, immensely relieved. It's my third visit, and I will definitely return. John is friendly and knowledgeable, and I didn't have to wait long for my good news!
__label__5	Li's carry out has saved us from having to cook many a night over the past few years. Our family and guests always enjoy it. The food is fresh, quickly prepared, and consistently good. They have been accommodating of special requests like adding tofu or putting sauce on the side.
__label__5	Standing in line here is definitely worth the wait.  The pancakes, french toast, and hash browns we had were amazing
__label__5	The food and the service was fantastic! Jerel is awesome and does his best to make all the customers happy! Great places to hang out!
__label__5	Calm professional environment. Great vibes. Love the layout. Hairwash sinks in the middle not cramped in back.
__label__5	I went to Jackson a few weeks ago just after it opened, and it was awesome. I had the truffle fries (a must) and a giant burger, which were both great. The atmosphere was also very cool-- clean and high end, but with a bar in front. The staff was really friendly, and from a glance at the brunch menu, it looks fantastic. The prices were great for the quality and quantity of food I received-- I'll definitely be back!
__label__5	"Excellent!!!!! to my surprise this little gem exceeded my expectation for the following reasons:

1) the price for less than $8 you can get a decent meal.
2) the food was fresh
3) the sauces (highly recommend the basil sauce)
4) the price includes drink

I have to say, the place is small, seating might be a problem for groups."
__label__5	"You couldn't ask for a better groomer.  They are friendly, flexible, and do an amazing job.  

I have a shiba inu, who to put it mildly can be a bit of a pain in the behind.  He hates the groomer, but he loves Top Paw.  7 years of hating the groomer and now he likes to go.  It's crazy.  

They do a great job with our greyhound as well.  I really can't recommend them enough.  They rock!"
__label__5	If there is a nirvana of toys, this is it. What a toy store should be, and used to be.  This place reminds me of some of the great German toy stores of Munich. Great O gauge train section with a layout with a drive-in theater.
__label__5	Best pizza in Indianapolis. It's sold by the slice or whole pies. It reminds me of the pizza I'm used to from Massachusetts and Mew York. There's also other Italian entrees but I haven't tried any. They have beer and wine, and the seating area is large.
__label__5	Great soft pretzels. Not like the stale, crusty variety that you see vendors (whose sanitary techiques are questionable I might add) push on the street corners. No, these are hot, airy, and soft. Each bite is pretzel perfection!
__label__5	If you love Moscow mules this is your spot! Famous for their blueberry and pineapple, the menu doesn't stop there, tonight they even had a gingerbread mule for the holiday season. My friend was looking for a less sweet mule, and tried the lavender which has a hint of flavor without being too sweet.
__label__5	I really love LA Nail Bar. It's generally super convenient for me since I live in the neighborhood but if you're coming from anywhere else it basically right off the broad street line. It's super clean and everyone is really helpful and sweet. Always like coming here :)
__label__5	I am sitting in the back on the porch enjoying what may be the best coffee of my life. A cup and tip will set you back a staggering $5, but it's leagues beyond your regular $2 cup. Not be to missed. Drink it slow, savor it, spend the money.
__label__5	Recently got my gel nails done here. I was looking for a place that would take me on an emergency since some of my nails needed to be replaced ASAP. The owners accommodated me after hours, which was amazing! They did an excellent job of fixing my nails and filling the rest with a super natural looking technique. They don't have a ton of colors or designs, so this place is best if you are looking for something natural or a bit simpler. But I will definitely come back to get my fills done here (even though it is half hour away from my place!).
__label__5	Amazing owner awesome vibes! Loved the fresh nachos and salsa. Drinks are amazing. New place to hang out on a Friday
__label__5	We came on an off night and Kylieana was great. My sister and my service dog were given the full whiskey treatment as well as Bourbon. Kylieana was amazing and I even invited her to visit NC. Thanks for a great night!
__label__5	I love their soup! My uber eats order was perfect:) i know there stuff is made of quality ingredients. Thank u zupas for exceeding my expectations. U guys rock:)
__label__5	Great deal if you're a university student looking for an affordable place to grab lunch. It's hard to beat their prices. The wait can be long for lunch especially on the weekends, so prepare to wait a bit or arrive early. Totally worth the wait!
__label__5	So loving to my dog, giving him the reassurance that everything will be okay!  They listen to my concerns and take the time to explain the plan and ask if I have any questions, responding in detail to assure of my understanding.  To all the doctors and staff, THANK YOU!  We are so grateful that we have San Roque Pet Hospital to care for our dog Captain!
__label__5	Was really nervous at first but Tim, our guide for that day was great! I am so glad I got to ride the segway. Always wanted to try and now it's checked off on my bucket list. Thank you Tim!
__label__5	"Walked in late one afternoon and was taken back for service immediately. 

Staff was very polite, salon was calm & immaculately clean. Can't wait to go back"
__label__5	We order pizza from Coco Bamboo at least once a week, and it is always delicious!! The staff and delivery drivers are always so nice and courteous! Love this place!
__label__5	I've always been a fan of southern BBQ and finding it up here in the north isn't as easy. Then I was brought to Zachary's and I was blown away. The pulled pork is delicious and the four cheese mac & cheese is superb. I was hesitant to try the sweet potato cheesecake but after trying it, my taste buds were screaming it wanted more. I definitely will be back!
__label__5	Food is awesome...very friendly people working. Clean environment. Christmas decor looks very good. Subs are hot and fresh
__label__5	LOVE IT. So elegant and accommodating. Very personal staff. The 10pm complimentary hot chocolate and PBnJ is to die for. Enjoy the pool and bar at this, of the few remaining independently owned hotels in NOLA.
__label__5	Best gluten free sandwich! We both had the Pickles and Swiss sandwich, mine was gluten free, and my husband said his was one of the best sandwiches he's had in a long time. The staff was super nice, brought our food outside to us and loved outdoor seating! Can't wait to come back again when we visit family!
__label__5	"They never fail to have a special I have to try.  White Almond Roca.  How many ways can I say delicious...
This is my favorite Tucson coffee spot."
__label__5	"Oh my goodness their food is so good! We did a one night getaway to Indy and had Naf Naf delivered since our kids were tired and we didn't want to drag them out. We ordered the chicken shawarma rice bowl, the fries, falafel, and hummus with pita. Everything was delicious.

The fries may have been better fresh at the restaurant, but everything else traveled beautifully. Their garlic sauce is so good and I'm not worried about vampires this week! The fries and falafel were even improved by it, though they were great to start with."
__label__5	I can't believe I didn't know this fabulous little spot was so close to my office. My friend and I split the beer brisket sandwich and the ham and cheddar sandwich. Both were fantastic but the brisket sandwich was over the top! Unlike any other I've ever had. And the homemade chips...addictive!!!!
__label__5	"I just had THE BEST Philly cheesesteak I have ever eaten and it was completely vegan! The ""meat"" is made of the impossible burger. I had mine made with vegan Gouda, mushrooms, jalapeños, and habaneros. The vegan chocolate donut was delicious. I washed it down with the exotic colada smoothie- pineapple, mango, banana, almond milk, and coconut water. I have to hit this place up again before I leave Tampa!"
__label__5	"Went here on a Friday night...first time..With several friends...didn't know what we were getting into!
What a wonderful surprise. ..appetizers were very good...we all tried each others entrees. ..everything excellent!!  Then the cheesecake. ..so lite and delicious. .great prices as well...definitely will be back"
__label__5	Everything we've had here is delicious: bagel sandwich, bear claws, etc. Best Donut Shop Ever!!!
__label__5	Great food. Huge portions! I had an omelet and I swear it had 6 eggs in it, and 2 pieces of toast and potatoes.  Definitely get your moneys worth here. Everything we had was very good and the service was solid all around. Would definitely go back.
__label__5	My wife and I stopped in for ribs before heading home from our weekend visit. This place was everything I'd hoped for. Authentic atmosphere, great service, outstanding food and reasonable prices. The ribs were among the best I've ever had. They were outstanding with just the dry rub they're prepared with.  The sauce was tasty and gave them a different twist. I could go either way.  This was our last meal in town and it was certainly one to remember!
__label__5	"This has become one of my fave brunch places in the city! I always recommend it to my friends and family that go out and visit! 
Went with a group of friends and everything was delicious! The bottomless mimosas took me outttttt! And I loved every bit of it lol and you can also take the cup to go and keep it as a souvenir! This is definitely a must go to restaurant."
__label__5	"I had been wanting to swing into The Lift for a long time and finally got a chance a few weeks ago.
The food was great, service was awesome, but the atmosphere was the best. Decorated in a ski lodge theme (with Bogus Basin stuff everywhere!!), playing reggae on the radio, I felt like they built this for Me! 
One of the coolest places in Boise. Highly recommend."
__label__5	EcoLawn just completed what for them I'm sure is a small job, but for us is an important one.  They put pavers in our park strip along with space for planters.  The pavers nicely match the ones we already have in our driveway and they did a superb and quick job of installing them.  The job was professional from beginning to end, including a very thorough clean up when the work was finished.  Not only does it looks beautiful, but it will take very little water and I will no longer need to labor every year to get those gnarly weeds out.  I highly recommend them.
__label__5	Amazing owner who is super loveable and fun. He has amazing skills and has reasonable prices.  He is open minded and will give you a wonderful piece of art to be proud of!
__label__5	Nothing we've gotten from here over the years has ever been less than fantastic. The breads, macarons, little pastries.. they are all baked to perfection!
__label__5	"Best Mac and Cheese. 
Everything was delicious will be going back! 
Steak and tuna were perfectly cooked!"
__label__5	Their taco's are the bomb! Super flavorful items at a great price. I got a couple taco's and the Shareable Egg-rolls. My husband and I really enjoyed our waitress and the Shaker Peel vibe.
__label__5	Just stopped in here for a slice of sausage pizza and decided to throw in a couple cannolis. The pizza was fantastic, but let's take a moment to talk about this cannoli. I have never had a better treat in my life. Unbelievable.
__label__5	Quickest fast food in town. Their Chimicanga con carnitas is awesome. Also their Tacos are great!
__label__5	Love this Argentinian spot! AND one of the best chocolatier in the city! I tried the Vegetarian arepas of course, the meat-filled empanada, the Pabellon (a shareable portion size) and ended it with hot chocolate and truffles. My friend got the beef stew as her main dish which was very hearty. The hot chocolate was made from some fine chocolates so it was rich and creamy. It came in a little shot glass which was the perfect amount. Cash only, BYO. But there juices are also good. Try the guava juice.
__label__5	This is my favorite local BBQ joint in So. City.  I'm addicted to their pulled chicken sandwich.   As many times that I order it, the chicken is always fresh and the Spicy sauce gives a nice kick.   So thankful to see this place thrive in our neighborhood.
__label__5	One of the only coffee shops in Saint Pete that still serve poor over and I am so thankful! Never had anything here that I didn't like! Super chill vibes, and great food and drink.
__label__5	"LOVE this place. The location, the menu, the prices, the service= 5 stars!
The fresh juice is so good and less expensive than Robeks. 
Just had their BBQ chicken salad which had a very generous helping of fresh chicken."
__label__5	I have been using Morevent HVAC for a while now and have been very pleased with their service. From the office staff to their skilled technicians everyone is great. My AC did not turn on for the Summer and they sent Joe Good out to see what issue was. He arrived promptly and was smiling and said he'll check everything out and find issue. He was thorough and did find the problem and took care if it. It was not simple but he found it. I am so glad I have an HVAC Co who are highly knowledgeable and principled. Thanks again.
__label__5	Just finished eating. There were 5 of us. We got biscuits & gravy, eggs and bacon, chicken and biscuits, and pancake. Food and service were great!
__label__5	We love this place! Ramen is so much richer and more flavorful than Pho and is the ultimate comfort food. Great service and amazing pork belly!!!
__label__5	Ally is amazing as well as Dylan and the entire staff here. Very friendly, sweet and helpful also  knowledgeable. I'm visiting from Cleveland Ohio and absolutely love this place. Amazing cocktails etc.
__label__5	Hungover brunch...but the comfort food provided by Southern was terrific. Wife had chicken and waffles and raved about it. I had crab cakes. Small portions but overall terrific! I highly recommend it after a night on Broadway.
__label__5	"The best food I've ever had I have tried most of the menu items and it all delicious and fresh 
I recommend this pizza place for any body looking for great customer service and delicious food 
Be aware of any other pizza place at your area Roma pizza is the best in Lavegne"
__label__5	I live in town, this is my go to when I don't want to go far. Everything is delicious here! Vito is great!
__label__5	Stopped in for lunch today . Started out with a glass of the seasonal cranberry sangria and my red wine lover husband's favorite Super Tuscan. We sipped over warm pretzel bread oh so yummy. Our server Felicia is such a delightful person with a great smile!!! She was super attentive!!! I started with the seafood bisque and hubby had the shredded Brussels salad and both were delicious. We shared the Grilled Asado flatbread and there were no leftovers for this visit.
__label__5	One of the best anytimes fitness gym ive been to. The owner is super nice and signed me up a few years ago. They keep the gym clean and stay up on the maintenance so you never see any gym equipment broken or out of use. Its open 24/7 and if you need anything just go see the owner or staff and they will help you with what ever you need.
__label__5	Stumpy's Hatchet was amazing, it's located in downtown New Orleans near the super dome. The staff was so pleasant and very knowledgeable. Stumpy's  is the perfect place for a family friend gathering, there's plenty of space for social distancing and the popcorn is to die for hot and fresh everytime.
__label__5	Went there on a Friday morning on a trip to San Francisco. Did not disappoint. I had the egg white veggie omelette and my friend had the cottage cheese and fruit. The food was hearty and delicious. Great service. Highly recommend!!!
__label__5	OMG sooooo delicious!! The pictures do not do justice for how yummy the food is!! Very fresh ingredients that seem simple but the way they combine with all the different herbs and seasonings is so refreshing and exciting! We tried the vegan platter and salad that starts with a F. Both were to die for! Huge portions! We split it and are fully satisfied! Also had to try the sweet potato coconut oil chips. Crisp and salty but somehow light. Cannot wait to try the other dishes!
__label__5	We had a fantastic meal at Mr. B's this past weekend! The food, drinks, atmosphere, and service were top notch. We were in a bigger group and our servers were so attentive. They didn't rush us at all and we were able to enjoy the experience. This was definitely one of the more expensive meals we had during our trip but absolutely worth it.
__label__5	Delicious Calzones! Figgy piggy was my favorite and can't go wrong with anything s'mores! Customer service was good too and plenty of outdoor seating
__label__5	Eric came today to give us an estimate. Very courteous, very affordable and very professional. He was on time and there was a reason for him not to be able to return my call right away (previous review).
__label__5	My first facial and I really can't complain! Included more than I realized! Prices are awesome. My husband really enjoyed his massage and felt great afterwards. Will be back!
__label__5	Took my son the week before Mother's Day so he could paint his grandma something. It was great, the ladies there were very helpful and attentive to our needs despite how full it was.
__label__5	This is such an awesome place! Live music is alive and popping in this area. You can go from venue to venue and enjoy lots of music in various genres. We even enjoyed a brass band that was playing in the middle of the street. Good adult fun!! This is a NOLA must do!!!
__label__5	"Family owned and certainly served with care and love. It's like walking into your healthy neighbor's kitchen and them sharing a meal with you. 
Great portions, balanced nutrients. I'm vegan and he's not but we both loved it and look forward to return to the area to have again"
__label__5	"Just is great. He is easy to work with, trustworthy, and reliable. He is also very knowledgeable. I would recommend anyone who needs a trust or will done, to  call Justin. 

Thank you Justin for all of your help!!"
__label__5	What a perfect spot to stop by, relax and just take a break from touring the French Quarter. You gotta try it, your feet will thank you!
__label__5	Definitely top of the line work for a great price. Taylor does one heck of a job. If you're looking to get any tint work done I highly recommend these guys!
__label__5	The Modern Paws is the best! The owners are delightful and very knowledgeable. I love that they offer a free delivery service for local orders of $35 or more. I have food delivered for my fur baby every 2-3 weeks, as needed, and they always promptly follow delivery instructions. If you live locally, this is the place the shot for your fur baby! I highly recommend.
__label__5	Great place, I have been going to Pho Tau Bay since I was a kid. Now that they have moved the place is still great and the new decor is cool.
__label__5	"I haven't bought a ""brand new"" car since 2001. Sam & Daniel made this purchase painless. They found the color & options I wanted and brought it in. They made the price right, gave me the incentives, & were right on with my trade. They took all of the bullets out of my negotiating gun. It was a wonderful experience & I would recommend it to anyone. I love my new Mitsubishi Outlander Sport! Thanks guys!"
__label__5	We came here for the first time for our wedding anniversary... My husband and I... I thought it would be a fun experience to try out and wasn't sure how the ice cream would actually taste. The ice cream was really good actually and the experience was fun for both of us...Their signature menu is definitely worth trying first and then once you get comfortable with the concepts you could branch out and create your own. They really know how to create good combos in the ice cream location.
__label__5	The most delicious libations!  I loved the Flaming Monkey, concocted fresh right in front of me.  So much better than the drinks from the adult slurpee machines that you'll find all over the French Quarter and elsewhere.  The drinks at the Organic Banana are made with real ingredients.  I didn't have one but the Pins Colada looked delicious too.
__label__5	I loved this place, they had such nice workers and they even give you water and they did an amazing job on my nails! I've gotten my nails done at a lot of places and this is at the top of my list of best places to go to!
__label__5	We had a great time on the snorkeling tour. Due to high winds our final destination was changed, but we still had a great time, saw plenty of sea life and dolphins, and felt very safe on the boat with our captains. They were very eco-conscious and made the trip a great family atmosphere. Would definitely recommend to others - groups of adults and families!
__label__5	Food is delicious-glad we found! Get the carbonara!! We also got pizza and Caccio y Pepe. Both very good also. Carbonara was just my favorite.
__label__5	"Don't let the location or the look fool you. You walk into this place and it is warm, clean and inviting. Definitely somewhere I would want to hang out if we lived in Florida, and definitely the perfect place to come on a windy, chilly evening. 
We got fish and chips and the fish TOOK UP HALF A DINNER PLATE!! It was perfectly flavorful and delicious and the beer batter was crunchy and delicious. We got the apple crumble and it was a perfect, shareable portion. It was awesome."
__label__5	Vicia is uniquely talented in that you can rest assured that no matter what you order off their menu, it's going to be a good dish. There are so many amazing plates that you'll want to try a bit of everything - if you can do this family style and have everyone pick a dish or two to share, I highly recommend doing so! The Turnip Tacos and Missouri Rice are must-haves. I'll be trying the Farmer's Feast (which features a three-course meal and wine pairings) next time for sure.
__label__5	"Normally not a review person, but these guys are great. Our dishwasher stopped draining water and after some amateur troubleshooting, I gave up and called them. They diagnosed the problem quickly, and promised to order a new part and install it in a few days. Later *that day* they called and said they had the part, and offered to fix it that day, which they did. 

Now, the appliance my wife and I call the ""marriage counselor"" is back up and running."
__label__5	This is an amazing restaurant, located in the heart of beautiful Doylestown... innovative cuisine and cocktails for a perfect night out!
__label__5	Immediate service, thoroughly checked everything, great prices and friendly. As a female, this is a place I trust, as they don't take advantage of that. This is a family-owned business with integrity.
__label__5	Love trying the new places that pops up. This is a new place at countryside mall. We had the crab stuffed tots super yummy and a boil. We ordered our boil with shirmp, snow crab and bendi crab and got the medium kitchen sink season. Very flavorful and affordable. Loved our severer Hannah.
__label__5	Compared to Oregon, where I currently reside, Idaho's state capital is much more impressive, beautiful and available to the public. It was open on a Saturday, and even with the street fair and other events going on, there were only a few other people inside. Both the interior and exterior are beautiful and well taken care of, and it's a peaceful way to spend about an hour. The best part though? It's completely free!
__label__5	The food makes me feel like I'm sitting in a big city Greco-East Mediterranean deli without taking the trip.The staff is friendly and accommodating to any reasonable requests to menu adjustments.The decor is comfortable 'fast-food' casual but you eat the food not the ambience especially earlier in the day.My only regret [ which is absolutely no reflection on the establishment ] is that I can't patronize this eatery more often.
__label__5	Absolutely fabulous experience. LOVED our dinner. The waiter, Felix, was so knowledgeable about the menu and explained every dish to us (we didn't know much about fish). We tried his recommendations and they were phenomenal! We'll be going back for sure.
__label__5	Our family loves this place. New York or Chicago style? It doesn't matter because they do both and do them great. I am a BIG fan of their deep dish.
__label__5	"I loved everything about Fabrika! The service was impeccable, the venue is so chic, the food and drinks were on point and delicious! 2 suggestions: 1. Have everyone ditch their phones and enjoy the experience.  The girl behind me had a light on her camera and took video of the entire show like she was TMZ.  2.  Have all tables face the center stage. 

I can't wait to go back with a group of friends! The show is literally a show set for Hollywood or Broadway! Amazing!!"
__label__5	Woohoo Dewey's! Love the pizza. their red sauce is a little spicy but I really like it. They also have Schlafly on tap which I am becoming a big fan of.
__label__5	The avocado Boba smoothie is made with fresh avocado and it's such a treat! Every once in a while I get a craving for this particular smoothie and it never disappoints!
__label__5	Nice little Sushi and Thai place. Parking in the rear but within walking distance of the Tesla Charger. Had the sashimi starter with a Rainbow roll. Big Chunks of sashimi in the starter. The rainbow roll was fresh and very good. Next time I will try some more of Thai items on the menu. The fragrance of next table over is tempting if I wasn't full.
__label__5	Lexi was da BEST!!! Changed our hookah out to hit the best!!! Lived the service. Give her a bonus!!
__label__5	The chef here is amazing! The location cannot be beat and the rooms are spacious and clean
__label__5	Great little shop and lounge. Owner listened to what I was looking for and made several suggestions. Support local businesses.
__label__5	We moved on Christmas Eve. The guys were great and professional even though it was not an ideal day to have to work. Thank you very much!
__label__5	Super delicious food! Great service from both the chefs and the waiters/ waitress! Best teppanyaki restaurant of them all!!
__label__5	Kelsey did such a great job! I wanted an updo for a wedding I was attending and she was able to fit me in quickly and do exactly what I asked. So many people gave me compliments on my hair! Thank you!!
__label__5	"It was my first time coming to New Orleans and when we got off the plane and entered the airport I was AMAZED. 

According to people who live here, this airport just opened a few days before we arrived. Everything was bright, open, and modern in design. The bathrooms were just as incredible. The toilet seat covers change automatically, which is why they don't have toilet seat covers in their stalls. Very sleek and up to date to today's modern era. I was very impressed."
__label__5	This is my second visit to the Old Barracks Museum and enjoyed it as much as the first time. The staff is very friendly and Bob's tour was filled with interesting facts and trivia. Highly recommend!
__label__5	I visited Adagio while I was on vacation. I like to eat and shop local when I can. Carrie provided my facial, and Robin provided my massage. Carrie was great, sweet, and very gentle with her technique. My skin felt refreshed. Robin was amazing. I've never fallen asleep during a massage, and I was so relaxed afterwards. I opted for water instead of the champagne, yet I did enjoy dessert.
__label__5	Absolutely Wonderful! We will definitely go back when we're in Philly again. Our waiter Dan was very attentive and gave us great recommendations for apps, entrees and dessert. Their special was red snapper - superb !! It came with a side of grilled corn and cherry tomatoes.  Go with friends and sample their creative menu - don't forget to order a great glass of wine, too !!
__label__5	Update: Owner messaged me directly and handled the situation. Because of his professional manner, I removed my review because I had no issue with the food, only the customer service with the front counter staff.
__label__5	What a great experience. East check in. Super clean bathroom. Great management. Quiet (well the 101 is right next door) but the park was super quiet. We will be back.
__label__5	Did a fabulous job on my Frye boots. Great customer service.
__label__5	Great place. Best soft scrambled eggs in the world. Love the extra-crispy potatoes. Deliciously-sinful pastries to boot. Kevin is the best!  :)
__label__5	"Great friendly place to eat great food a bit noisy but always great service 
Regular dinner out place for me and you can always expect great food and ask for bar chips they are amazing too"
__label__5	"This place was amazing. My son and I went and as he remarked, this would be a great date place. 

This is not a good place for little kids but was a great interactive art experience. The wall with the paper tubes was amazing. Actually, all of the exhibits were really cool. 

I miss things you can do in a city and was thrilled to be able to see this."
__label__5	"Ok this place is awsome. Nice staff Cool stuff to look at. Drink and shoot pool. Went there on a thur and they had a special 3 PBR pitchers , not my favorite beer but i guess it will do. Well compared to everything else in the neighborhood extremely over priced this place was a treat. The second bar upstairs past the courtyard was also pretty neat, try the signature midnight potion drink, it just might get you messed up . 
Will def stop by that bar everytime im in new orleans. In that neighborhood its somtimes nice to get to listen to some rock music at the bar."
__label__5	We love this place.We come here at least once a week. We love their salad, their pizza, their garlic knots. If the music is too loud, they will turn it down. Their servers  are nice and quick. Can't wait for the Sparks restaurant to open up. Only wish  we got coupons/offers in the mail.
__label__5	I love the brisket nachos! Neat little BBQ! Staff is greasy prices are great. The corn Casserole is good too!
__label__5	Awesome sandwiches. The gyro lamb sandwich is great!  Super friendly and a great lunch spot
__label__5	We took our dog to the new location in Reno after reading great reviews on Yelp. And I can confirm this place is great! Thank you Dr. Kalivoda for taking such good care of Sobe:-)
__label__5	"We ordered...
Drinks: Mr. Big, Sidecar, & Barrel Aged Bouldevardier
Food: Sidecar Salad w/ crawfish, oysters, & the manchego burger

Everything we ordered was FANTASTIC. One of the best salads I've ever had. The fries are very unique, almost like a combo between a potato chip and a fry. The atmosphere is great - you would never know it was right next to a highway."
__label__5	"I worked with Travis and Melissa at Surratt Law. Both were very professional and caring. They listened to all of my issues and were sympathetic and understanding of my plight. They sat down with me and really listened which was a new experience for me. They did not rush me or make me feel less important than more wealthier ""higher end"" clients. I made it clear that I did not have a lot of money as my last attorney cost me pretty much everything I had (over $35k) I would highly recommend both of them for divorce, property or estate planning needs."
__label__5	Great food! We've been here 3 times and have left stuffed and happy each time. Their meats are great, but honestly I keep going back for their mac n cheese and pig powder fries (seasoned french fries). You HAVE to dip the fries in their white bbq sauce!
__label__5	"I love this video store! Redbox can't have EVERY movie, and Video Memories definitely has a good selection! It really does bring back memories of my childhood, renting movies every Friday night.. 

The staff here is always friendly and willing to help you locate even obscure movie titles. I love that this location is within walking distance of my house, too!"
__label__5	This ramen was amazing!! I had the unfortunate or maybe not unfortunate mistake of eating the pork belly thinking it was chicken (I don't eat pork) and let me tell you - I was not mad. The pork belly was AMAZING. The broth was extremely flavorful with strong spices and a perfect blend of umami. I would definitely recommend this spot.
__label__5	Went to dine in today.  It was a great experience.  The dim sum was made to order so it was nice and hot.  The rice noodle roll was very thin which makes it so good.  The pumpkin soup was awesome.    General Tso's Chicken was crispy and flavorful.  Would definitely come back.
__label__5	It was incredible! The lobster bisque is one of the best items in the menu, and the classic lobster roll left me without words.
__label__5	Hattie B's is definitely a wonderful place for chicken.  We ended up coming to this location after trying to go to the more popular location by the Midtown area.  The other location had a line that was a block and a half long, 45 minutes before opening.  So a quick 10 min drive and we had a short line that only took a few minutes to go through and not worry about not getting a seat.  But more importantly was the chicken was fresh and tasty.  Both my wife and I LOVED it!!!  I cannot wait to come back again for some more.
__label__5	We were greeted so politely as we entered. It was our first time there and the person behind the counter was so friendly and explained how every thing is made in house. We tried the Cubano and Spicy salami sandwiches. They were great! We will definitely be back!
__label__5	AMAZING food!  Order one of the bento boxes; I got the shrimp tempura bento box - YUM.  Every single dish in it is delicious and you get so(!) much food.  And even if you're not a hot tea person, give the green tea a shot (but add a little sugar if you're a sweet tooth like me).  Service was impeccable and the meal was unforgettable.  Definitely going back.
__label__5	Bud & Marilyns is one of my favorites restaurants to go to in center city. It's perfect for all occasions - brunch, dates, out with friends, or celebrations! Thankful that they are offering outdoor dining during covid! Highly recommend coming here - I have never been disappointed!
__label__5	I like their chicken a lot!! So much better than KFC or Popeyes for sure! Staffs are friendly and it is very easy to in and out
__label__5	Beer, Fries, Mussels = World Class.  The other items are pretty great too.  Awesome burger!
__label__5	Great little cafe feeling with lots of room and great food. Found this gem on a Google search one morning,  well worth the visit. Pleasant staff, fresh food, and good prices. Will return for more meals.
__label__5	Andrew did my neighbors fence. It look really nice got a quote from him. I was looking for a while but his price was the best and he came out and did the job very quick and look beautiful. I would highly recommend Andrew his company. He's very professional and does a great job. Thank you Andrew.
__label__5	These guys are great ... And not just for cracked screens.  Last year I brought in a phone that wouldn't charge.  They showed me how to pull the lint out of the charging port.  Today, on another phone, It happened again so I did it myself; no luck.  So I brought it to Ubreakifix and they took it around back, told me to come back in an hour.  I came back and the phone was ready... Charging port OK, just needed a cold restart.  NO CHARGE!
__label__5	Excellent breakfast. Had the European omelet and it was very good. My favorite was the breakfast potatoes. The pastry's in the glass case looked wonderful but we didn't try any. Will definitely eat there again when we are back in Reno.
__label__5	Definitely expect a line if you come here but it's totally worth it. Just be cautious about the spice level, I personally have a high tolerance for spicy food and thought the medium was perfect, I tried the damn hot level and my entire mouth was on fire. Would recommend to eat this hot and fresh instead of ordering to go!
__label__5	I ate at Recess for the first time last night. The service was great and the food was amazing. By far the best meal I've ever had in Indy!
__label__5	Very easy to schedule an appointment and our Vet Dr. Collins was outstanding as was the vet tech in taking care of our dog.  Dr. Collins' approach to ordering tests and ruling things out was explained very well, and our dog improved quickly.  If you're looking for an honest Vet, with no high pressure guilt and scare tactics, this is the place.  The office is very nice and modern, and the unique L shaped waiting room makes it easy to keep your pooch away from other patients while waiting.  The front office staff are also very friendly.  We'll be back for regular checkups and vaccines.
__label__5	Quaint location well maintained. Food was perfectly prepared. I had the grouper sandwich. Frites were nicely fried and unique!
__label__5	Great customer service. He stayed a little later than he had to and helped the person I was transferring the title to get it done smoothly. Appreciate it!
__label__5	Best bagels on the planet! Some bagels can be so hard and difficult to chew... These are soft and amazing! Although I try to eat healthy most of the time, this is one of my guilty pleasures. farmhouse breakfast sandwich has all kinds of meats... Absolutely delicious!
__label__5	Awesome sandwich shop!! I have been here multiple times, have tried many sandwiches, and have never been disappointed. Every sandwich is made with love, I know this because each sandwich takes about twenty minutes to make. That's honestly the only downfall about Ryebrew. They also have a great beer selection which is also a great way to waste some time there. Oh an up stairs they also have a shuffle board table! So if you have a love for fresh and awesome sandwiches this is your spot.
__label__5	Excellent spot! The baristas are really nice people and the food/coffee was great! Highly recommend it!!!
__label__5	My husband and I had fun trying the different flavors of cider they had on tap. We loved every one we tried and ended up going home with 2 growlers of cider. The employees were super friendly and helpful. We loved the ambiance of the place and had a great time there. We will definitely be back soon.
__label__5	This a true Florissant gem. If you don't live in the area, it is worth the drive. Awesome food and quaint atmosphere. When the weather is nice, we love to sit on the patio. The mature trees make you feel like you are in a secret garden. Did I mention that the food is AMAZING?!?!
__label__5	Great little place for brunch or a snack. Friendly service and great food. I've only had the biscuit-based dishes so far but will branch out at some point.
__label__5	Definitely order some Bonuts. Loved the vegetarian grits & eggs. All food was tasty and we enjoyed sitting outside in the courtyard.
__label__5	Oh my goodness! Hands down the best place to get a cheesesteak in town! Whether your looking for good ol' provolone cheese or cheese whiz, hot or sweet peppers, steak or chicken Frankie's has it!
__label__5	Need keys made that actually work then this is the place to go. Simple as that!!
__label__5	Merridee's is hands-down the absolute best bakery in middle Tennessee. Everything is good. Everything. The croissants are made in the traditional French butter block style and SO good!!!
__label__5	Nice place. They had a varity of takes on the grilled cheese sandwich. I had the Pizza GC, which was very good. It was two pieces of sour dough bread with mozzarella cheese, tomatoes, and pesto in between and grilled perfectly. It was of a good size, so go hungry. They also had a large varity of beer, if you like to try different beers. They have several televisions so you could catch the game as well.
__label__5	Tiffany styled my daughter's hair so beautifully for her daddy daughter dance. We had a wonderful experience at LaDee-Da Kids Spa. I'm sure we will be back :)
__label__5	Best pizza I have ever had!!! Called in the order half an hour before closing to ensure it would be ready for dining in; the pizza was ready on the dot, super fresh, and incredibly delicious. The waitstaff was very friendly, attentive, and accommodating. The decor is fantastic, and I can't say enough incredible things about this place! I had a large half Nut Belly half sausage pizza - the ingredients were fresh and flavorful, and the crust was just perfect. Definitely stop in - a must try!!!
__label__5	Tyler and Landon were awesome!! I don't like moonshine but they made the experience very enjoyable. HIGHLY Recommend the pickles!
__label__5	Stopped in for a quick lunch on Friday. I went with the general tso wrap and it was fantastic! Wife went with the salmon salad and she seemed to really enjoy it. She was raving about how the salmon was cooked. The service was great as usual. We will continue to go here. Solid 5 stars
__label__5	Excellent! From a family that has had Vietnamese food in many places. Relaxed atmosphere and very friendly staff. I recommend this place!
__label__5	Do yourself a favor and get some hot stone bowl bibimbap! Everything here is fresh and delicious. Friendly, fast service. I love this place!
__label__5	Great place. One person was working when I was there and he was very nice & helpful. Cute shop
__label__5	Hogan Transfer & Storage made our move from Avon to Georgia go as smooth as could be.  From the time that we made the first call until the last item was moved off the trailer, everyone involved was professional, involved and ready to help.  A special thank you to Charlie and his team for completing the job under less than ideal conditions.
__label__5	They are Fantastic!  Did a very professional job hanging our tv and moving our wireless router.  Definitely recommend them!!
__label__5	"I brought my two German shepherd mixes to the park today and we had a blast! 
You park your car then walk to the right and there are trails you and your pups can walk through. There's even a creek to let them splash around in. My dogs loved all the smells and the adventure. Great park."
__label__5	My first time he was a major success.  I had the Jamaican Jerk  chicken wrap and totally green smoothie. Awesome. Can't wait for my next visit
__label__5	Great new Spot in Montecito!  Was warmly greeted by Phil upon arrival,  then proceeded to have excellent service the entirety of the night.  The place was surprisingly busy for being so new.  Ate with 4 friends, we shared a flat bread, a pasta, a salad, and a fish dish.  Honestly all of them were incredible.  We asked our server for help with wine suggestions, we loved the wines recommended to us.  Definitely will return!
__label__5	Thank you Rose!  You were a pleasure to talk to, relaxed, kind, genuine.  I would recommend you to anyone.  Offered me many options, and even recommended I go back to my previous plan.  Obviously trust worthy and looking out for my best interest. Thank you thank you thank you.
__label__5	Good burgers, fries and onion rings.  Great service.  Tina was very helpful and friendly.
__label__5	I had heard this was very good but it was excellent! I had the mussels in green curry which was so good I could have licked the bowl! Lol! I think their creative combo of ingredients in all their dishes is outstanding. My date also enjoyed his dish. Happy hour prices are good. Service was excellent and personable. Can't wait to return.
__label__5	We loved this place!  We had the Hannibal it was delicious !! My daughter had the pastrami, that was great too!  Food was hot and fries were crispy on the outside and soft inside, perfect!
__label__5	My favorite yogurt  chain!  I'm in love with the lychee flavor - it is so cool and refreshing.
__label__5	Food was Great! I had the Salmon BLT and my friend had the Crab and asparagus grilled cheese. Our waitress was attentive and was consistently making sure we had everything we needed. The outside sitting was very nice as well. We will definitely be going back
__label__5	Alessi's staff is amazing! They assisted me last minute in a specialty cake order and I couldn't have pulled it off without them! The staff was friendly, accommodating and I couldn't be more pleased with the outcome! I will definitely be coming back and telling anyone who may be looking for a bakery!!
__label__5	"I've been going here for years just to listen to the music. They have fantastic artists playing awesome jazz.

I love the retro feel of the place. Red vinyl covering the booths and the seats at the bar, sleek black tables and floors, funky martini selection with original names. I used to go for the food, but the menu has since changed and my favorite dishes are no longer available. Sigh.

I might grab a hummus plate, though. That never fails to satisfy. You need something to wash down the martinis anyway."
__label__5	Yummy breakfast spot. Friendly service from the moment you walk in. You will WAIT to be seated but it is worth the wait. You can make a reservation which we will do next visit. The omelet was delicious. The French toast superb. The service was okay but under the circumstances, aka a packed house, we got adequately tended to. Rustic theme. Oh and NO MASK NAZIS!!!!!!
__label__5	I've been to Frida's a few times, mainly because any time I am within a 2 hour radius of STL I'll actually drive that far out of my way to eat here.  It's that good.  Healthy foodie's paradise.
__label__5	You will dream of these weenies, one of the places I can't wait to visit when I come out here.
__label__5	"Gotta say, I hit about 40 bars and restaurants while in NoLa and this was probably my favorite! It is a drinkin person's bar, not for the faint of heart. 

I went with a group of about 20 with the intention of having one drink. Last thing I remember was jumping out of a moving cab to go back for one more. 

Seriously love this bar. Dark place. Strong drinks. Back yard patio and bar! 

I'll be back!"
__label__5	This was my best cake experience in Indy. The interior design of the shop was great. I had the red velvet cupcake and millionaires chocolate cake. It was pretty expensive but the taste made it worth it !
__label__5	The staff is amazing. They are all super friendly. They do great work. They fit you in there schedule promptly. I highly recommend them.
__label__5	Had an amazing experience here. Riding a bike is the ONLY way to visit new Orleans in my book.
__label__5	Sooooooooooo good! Words can't even explain it. Hubby and I came in on empty stomachs, so everything looked good at that point. I got the atomic burger with bacon added, and he got the mushroom Swiss. Let me tell y'all... Boom Burgers is where it's at! We will definitely return.
__label__5	Just moved into town and I was looking for a place to eat and lunch his place popped up on the nearby search. Really good New York style pizza for a pretty good price I did the lunch special with one slice and a soda for just about $6 and it was a large slice (the kind of slice you got to fold in half to eat and even then the tip drops down! I will definitely be back
__label__5	I always hear mixed reviews on this place, since I live locally so I thought to give it a shot and see for myself... The drinks were amazing here for starter. I ordered the vegan burger which was so good, since it's hard to get a great vegan burger. My mother ordered the bison burger and loved it as well! Everything was great, I really don't understand the bad reviews on this place. I would recommend to try this place if you are on the healthier side and are vegetarian/vegan!
__label__5	The hotel is in a couple old buildings that have been renovated. It is downtown and within walking distance to the french quarter. The staff must have to take a personality test. Everyone was extremely friendly, in a sincere way. Our room was average size but cool with exposed brick. The bar is fun and has a great happy hour. Slightly more expensive but worth the money.
__label__5	"Of all the Target stores in the area, this is my favorite.   Tons of parking, rarely crowded, clean, well stocked, helpful staff and great grocery and fresh produce selection.   This store always has a lot of mark-down items at the end of the aisles so you can pick up some great stuff and an attractive price.

The store is also relatively small so navigating through is quick and easy.   Checkout is also a breeze because they also have multiple check out lines open."
__label__5	Think of everything a consumer hates about calling for service and then flip it all in the positive. That is Adam Mechanical. Honest, responsive, prompt, fair pricing, clean,safe, knowledgeable.
__label__5	Very nice pub with a good atmosphere.  Bartender was friendly and helpful, giving us little tasters of their rotationals before committing to a pint. Awesome service and awesome place overall, I will definitely be going back!
__label__5	I have to say I have been very pleased with my service from Moxie and the status of my pests around the home. We have not had any issues with scorpions or any other critters since having Moxie servicing our home. Our tech Luis that did today's treatment was polite and thorough.
__label__5	Sharing a slice of blackout cake with my daughter! Oh my gosh! So delicious! Always a stop (almost every day!) on my trips to St. Pete!
__label__5	"Sooo much to choose from! The fabric selection is amazing! The staff are very friendly and eager to assist you with your project. Their book section is huge and so is the variety of packages pre packaged for multiple quilts! This is my Favorite Quilt Shop!
Lauri."
__label__5	Found this place last minute and was happy I did. It was very busy on Sunday wait was about 25 mins but seemed quicker. We sat out on the patio which was very nice and the weather was amazing! Our server was super nice and very attentive! Our food didn't take long everything was hot and delicious. One portion could feed 2 I felt like since we took a lot home.
__label__5	Awesome bar and grill and sports bar. Some great food - standard American fare, but great quality. Thanks for a great meal!
__label__5	Grungy and hard to find (but in the good way) this is exactly the kind of anti-establishment scene I was looking for when I came to Trenton. There was a collection of interesting looking characters, so it's a local gathering place it seems. Oh, and the latte and cappuccino were pretty good too!
__label__5	Everything from the crispy fries and the phillys are amazing. There is nothing pretentious about Trilly Cheesesteaks. It's a nice small place to get a delicious philly. I ordered the buffalo chicken and it was amazing. The bread was soft and the chicken, peppers, and the mushrooms were hot when the food arrived at the table.
__label__5	"Always a treat to stop by Argilla! I can hardly stand to go a week without picking up a pizza or dropping in for a beer. 
Their rotating drafts are always interesting with something for everybody. And their food specials are worth checking out, though it's hard to pull myself away from the usuals. Lots of thanks to the hard work the staff have put in the past year!"
__label__5	I'm so grateful to have such a great Honda Moto dealership in my town! Jack is awesome, he knows his bikes old/new and always takes good care of mine. Honda Al is a legend, no wonder they've been in business over 50 years!
__label__5	Delicious!  Everything is so flavorful, portions are large and the prices can't be beat.  I can't wait to order from here again.
__label__5	Constitution Yards is the best outdoor venue to frequent in the summer if you're looking for a fun and relaxed vibe. Not only is this the Riverfront's new hot spot to grab a drink, it's family friendly. Parents can unwind with friends while their kids play in the sand, and dog owners get the benefits of a dog park coupled with their favorite craft brews.
__label__5	One of my favorite Mexican restaurants in St. Louis! There is never a wait and the food is always hot and delicious! My favorite dishes are the nachos texanos and quesadilla mexicana... They give you a large portion so many times, it's hard for me to finish!! If you are looking for authentic Mexican.. You have found your restaurant :)
__label__5	I love this local bike shop.  Jose is always very friendly and helpful.  They are very knowledgeable about bikes and repairs.  I recommend this shop to anyone.
__label__5	Love love love them!! This is the second time I have used them and had a great experience both times! I wanted something fun for Christmas and Lisa more than delivered!!
__label__5	Indian food is one of my must haves, so I am pretty picky.  I can honestly said that this place easily makes my top-ten best India ... maybe even top-five!  There are just so many things that I want to eat when I go here.  The Butter Chicken is amazing, the Veggie Pakora is to die for, the Chicken 65 make my mouth water even now as I'm writing this review ... and I could go on and on.  Damn ... now I'm going to have to go there now!
__label__5	"Delicious and very tasty. The lady named Lilly was so nice and polite to us. Very good customer service and again so polite. 
Awesome food. Very much affordable and lots to food to eat. Everything was so fresh and I must say very very yum!!!loved it.
Ever visiting Reno then a must try king buffet!!!"
__label__5	I was craving a juicy, greasy burger and found myself at M.L Rose ordering the bacon cheeseburger with waffles fries and a beer. No regrets. The burger was cooked well and the fries were especially tasty-just like Chik-fil-a but better! The menu has a list of specialty burgers that looked enticing, so I'll have to return one day and try those.
__label__5	"I love this place! It has been my favorite Philadelphia restaurant for some time now. The menu changes with the seasons, and always offers something new, fresh and super delicious! It's just a few blocks of Rittenhouse Square and offers what I think is a superior product and ambiance for the buck compared to some of the ""trendy"" (over-hyped) restaurants right near the Square. I love to eat (and drink) at the bar with friends while we people watch, and chat with Irene the super friendly owner (part time bar tender)!"
__label__5	This place I is amazing!!! Burgers are absolutely delicious. The shakes are hand made ... the chocolate shake has chocolate  whipped cream on top!!! This guy is serious about making the best burgers any where. Give yourself a treat and stop in.
__label__5	Best biscuits in town. The cornbread with cane syrup and the griddles banana bread also amazing. Coming back to grab pastries before we head to the airport tomorrow.
__label__5	I love the tortas, they are second to none and the prices are incredibly reasonable. Their nachos are fantastic and the staff is very friendly.
__label__5	Best small spot in town. Owner is super hands on and talks to every table. We were there and it was very busy, due to a 5 min wait for or reserved table the owner bought everyone a drink and a desert. The pasta was amazing, really impressed with everything. Great date spot in town.
__label__5	If we lived closer we would be regulars. The pastries are incredible. The chocolate croissant had enough crunch and chew. It is hard to find high quality pastries and this place is definitely doing it right.
__label__5	LOVE this place! Went here every morning I was in Nola. I loved the Tracey's addiction thing I got and the environment was awesome. I had some work to do and it's perfect for that or just for hanging out. And the people were super nice.
__label__5	My 2 friends and I did the 5 course blind tasting with a wine pairing, and it was fantastic. The wines complimented the dishes perfectly, and the service was excellent. I definitely want to go back and try both the lunch and brunch options.
__label__5	Stopped by to have a specialty nose pad replaced on my 7yo daughter's glasses. I'm from out of town. They had the part and had me out in 5 mins. This was my second stop as the one on the Mesa Cliff and Meigs is closed on Mondays. It should have been my first stop. Very nice people and only $5 for part and labor. Would be my regular if I lived in SB.
__label__5	So delicious. I highly recommend this place and I am borderline vegetarian. Meat loaf was so delicious. The drinks were very tasty too. Staff was attentive and friendly
__label__5	"The beef stew was overwhelmingly delicious and the potatoes and cabbage wee just ""melt in your mouth""amazing!"
__label__5	The food is really insanely good comfort food.  The Thanksgiving style dinner is as good as anything grandma would make:  great roast turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce and whipped sweet potatoes. The St Louis ribs (I thoroughly enjoyed the BBQ sauce) were great. And the French fries are among the best I've ever had. Add an interesting, but not overwhelmingly large, list of craft brews in a casual atmosphere with attentive and friendly staff and how can you go wrong. Will definitely add this to the must visit list for our next trip to Philly. Thanks!
__label__5	If you ever find yourself in an emergency situation, I highly recommend going to RBVH! I unfortunately had to rush my cat, Toby, there Sunday night (5/29/16) and I have been commending their team ever since! Dr. Nowak,Kristin, and Ana were very knowledge, informative, and compassionate. I'm very grateful I had them by me and Toby's side !!
__label__5	"Love this place.  Atmosphere is great and it's far enough away from the ""fru fru"" of Howard Ave.  Food is great and I've never experienced anything other than amazing service.  It's difficult to have dinner w out spending $50 including drinks and tip, but it's worth it!  Rooftop,bar and outdoor seating are both also nice."
__label__5	"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! 
I cannot express how much I enjoyed my time at this restaurant! My boyfriend and I just popped in for a quick drink and ended up staying for hours! The whole crew there was so sweet. I got a yummy margarita and my boyfriend ordered the paradise park beer. I also ate one of the best cubanos I've ever had in my life! My boyfriend ordered the ropa vieja and said he loved it. 

This place is a MUST!"
__label__5	"Love it!

- Fantastic hummus and Lamb -Reasonable prices
-Nice shot too byob

Highly recommend casual dining but healthy."
__label__5	Friendly staff, great burritos, and the best shredded beef tacos anywhere.
__label__5	Great authentic Thai food, can't wait to go back! I love the crab Rangoon. Pad Thai and chicken satay!
__label__5	Portions are small, but everything was bursting with flavor. Service was excellent and made the experience extra special.
__label__5	Awesome atmosphere and delicious food. Gourmet margaritas are a specialty.They have local craft beers on tap.
__label__5	I went to get my ears pierced and was so impressed with the cleanliness of the shop, the friendliness of the staff and the great, sterile and painless way the repierced my ears. 100% better than my other ear piercing experience. Thanks Matt for making it a great experience.
__label__5	I went to Molley for a cut and conditioning treatment and felt so comfortable here! The ambience is lovely and the staff was knowledgeable and made me feel at home. Thoroughly impressed!!
__label__5	"Good food soups excellent service 
Would recommend highly 
Near theater Arden other things to do"
__label__5	My cousin recently took me to this place and I have to say I really liked it! The food is very flavorful and they present it wonderfully! The sitting area in the court yard only enhances the experience. If you want quality food at a decent price go here!
__label__5	The best! Julie is a terrific hostess, the food is great, and the wine they keep for my group is outstanding. We make this a definite stop every time we are in Nashville!!
__label__5	So many sweet treat options with their ice cream and they have the best prices on the island!!
__label__5	Great food! Excellent service. We've only eaten here twice and after the first time, the staff remembered which seats we sat at and recommended some things we'd like. Never disappointed eating here!
__label__5	"Lindsey is a rockstar! 
We always ask to be seated in her section because she's the best. Food is great but let's be honest we all want an experience and she will give you one! Highly recommend!"
__label__5	Been nothing but a very positive experience from dealing with Julia and Stephanie in the store to the installation of our new 360 i l e bed. Love the bed, what a game changer. Only negative was we had to wait about six weeks for delivery, but even then, we were told that before we purchased so that's ok.
__label__5	"Wow punk rock times ten . The steps so hardcore just an amazing decent into chaos's realm of discontent. Felt like
In the 80's stomping  into the hell holes of early New York .great feel and security so cool . Staff amazing"
__label__5	Warm, friendly, inviting, and fresh homemade regional Mexican food.  This place is unparalleled.
__label__5	This place is right in my wheelhouse. It's food is like the type of food that would be in my wheelhouse.
__label__5	I had a great experience at AutoNation Honda Clearwater. Sandra B. helped me and she was friendly, low-pressure, and personable. I visited a number of dealerships before AutoNation and had a very different experience. After going in to see a used HRV, Sandra learned a bit more about me and I ended up leaving with a new HRV...in the color I really wanted. The buying process was easy and painless. I would recommend coming here.
__label__5	The best manicure I have ever gotten. The prices are extremely low and the people are so nice. 10/10. I love this place.
__label__5	Best brunch ever. A little pricy but well worth it! Cocktails were all delicious as well! It's hard to locate once you've parked, it's in one of the John's Hopkins children Hospital buildings.
__label__5	Outstanding and authentic.  Going there again tonight and If I lived closer would go more often.  As many have said, no menu you can come up with your own stuff or ask for advice.  Interior is simple, not fancy by any means but the Italian food cant be beat in the Tampa area with only one exception...(starts with a D).  Hidden gem category....
__label__5	As a music buff this is my jam. The history of this hall is astounding as are the musicians who roll through here. You can sit and get lost in the music for hours. It is timeless and a destination all Americans should visit.
__label__5	"I love this place, so I always try to come when in town.  It's super popular but it's worth the wait for the creative and delicious fare.  This time I had the Migas (scrambled eggs with onions, tomatoes, cilantro, pepperjack cheese, spicy chorizo, garnished with sliced avocado, pico de gallo, chipotle sour cream and crispy tortilla chips). Seconds please!
The mimosas were a great start to my day as well, haha."
__label__5	"I love everything about Spice Box and you will too once you eat their food!

Most people know them for their infamous Spice Wraps, but I'm a huge fan of their Naan Taco.

Their mango lassi is a refreshing treat to top off a flavorful meal.

Friendly staff and eclectic space, I love visiting Spice Box!"
__label__5	The absolute BEST sandwiches in Tampa! They have a large selection of side salads and many different sandwiches that you can choose from. The Cuban is enough for 2 people to share and is one of my favorite sandwiches there.
__label__5	"Great atmosphere.
Good food.
Average service.
Pricy: Breakfast for people costed $65.00 plus tip"
__label__5	A great zoo with lots to see!  The dolphin dome is fantastic and I could watch the Orangutans all day in the Space Mountain-like structure that dominates the area.
__label__5	Most auto places in the area are either overpriced or treat you poorly. Not Reeder's! We had an amazing experience. From the first call to finished product, we were very pleased. They took the time to explain everything on the phone and got us in for a detailing next day. The car looks brand new and is spotless. We will definitely be back for more jobs.
__label__5	"I can't believe all the other whiny reviews about here complaining about things like ordering over a counter or the quality of a burger (the placed has ""pizza"" in the title ... maybe you should try the PIZZA). 

Indeed, you should try the pizza because it's the best in Missouri. Minsky's or Uno in KC, Shakespeare's in Columbia ... they don't make pizza half as good as Epic Pizza. That said, the best pizza in Missouri -- Epic Pizza -- is probably average for NYC."
__label__5	I love this theater thanks to all your changes. I have to admit that the dine in food is so good i find myself trying to find a movie just because i am craving your food. The food is better than half of our resteraunts in Franklin.
__label__5	Best go to sushi in town!    We order from here few times a month for years now. Never ever disappointed.  Everything is so good.  Friendly staff.  Get sushi for 4 best deal in the city.  They only use fresh ingredients here.  Fast delivery always on time.
__label__5	Truly nothing bad to say about this place!! Eat here several times a month!!! Everything is sooo good!!!
__label__5	"Great pizza! Great Delivery! Super deals. 

Anytime we need pizza for an event Westshore always comes through. Thanks!

If you're looking for great pizza this is it."
__label__5	Love this bakery! Great selection and tremendous customer service! Cakes, pies, nice variety of dessert bars and brownies, cookies, gelato during the warmer months, bread loaves (cornbread too), muffins and more. You'll leave with a smile.
__label__5	YUMMY, YUMMY, YUMMY!! Steak classic and crinkle cut fries...the best! Clean restaurant, friendly people!
__label__5	Shawna is our favorite waitress, she's awesome. She always makes our dining experience enjoyable. The food as usual was on point everything was cooked to perfection and the steaks were delicious . Also when you go make sure to try their splash berry drinks  they're absolutely awesome and you get free refills doesn't get any better than that!
__label__5	Great food and good sized portions. Everyone was friendly and attentive. Enjoyed the Chicken Salad Salad.
__label__5	The best catfish!  Mild was the perfect level of spice but the hot sauce was extremely spicy!  Fantastic service; the wait staff were so friendly and helpful.  I highly recommend this place!
__label__5	it's a relief to know a place exists in the city that is clean and has standards. the staff has always been really nice and they are really knowledgeable about their craft.  this is the only piercing place i recommend to people!
__label__5	Great stadium. Fans that love the Broncos. Saturday night watching Boise State under the lights is a must do for college football fans.
__label__5	This place is great, been going here since I was a child. This isn't your typical sub place so don't go there thinking of subway or publix. They have their own distinct taste and style. For me growing up here it is one of the spots for subs!
__label__5	Buddha Bowls is a super cool place in Santa Barbara that is unlike any other, their creations are super delicious and unique and there should definitely be more places around the US similar to this place. The day we came here staff wasn't the best, they seemed stressed, overwhelmed with work even though they weren't crazy busy and made us feel like an inconvenience for coming in, however, their food was worth it. The bowls are extremely filling, be prepared to have leftovers. Highly recommend this place.
__label__5	Great atmosphere, great hand crafted cocktails, awesome waitstaff and phenomenal cuisine!
__label__5	Always a great experience. Kind and friendly staff and the girls feel at ease here. Would def recommend!
__label__5	"What I love about the Frothy Monkey is the exceptional customer service. No matter the time of day I am always greeted by the staff and encouraged to try new things. Currently I am making my way through their food menu and their seasonal offerings on coffee drinks always leaves me satisfied and well caffeinated. 

Foremost, the location is excellent for people-watching and striking up conversations with random strangers."
__label__5	We had a wonderful time. First place we've been to since the lockdown. Food was wonderful! Serbia fabulous. Can't recommend more.
__label__5	Terrific place. Stopped by after a long day at Busch Gardens. Conveniently located. Detroit style pizza is awesome here. I'm coming back. It's also great to support a father and son small business endeavor. Waaaaaaaay better than the hut.
__label__5	"They have heavy cream for your coffee!
That, right there, makes this a 5 star establishment.

Paleo people, heads up!  real cream!
I ordered a 16 oz coffee this morning.
Requested heavy cream..

It was absolutely delicious and not Starbuck prices.
Paleo/Ketogenic/Primal humans.. This place is worth a visit!

You're welcome."
__label__5	Love this place. I ordered a pizza to go last night, along with a Caprese salad. Salad was amazing. Pizza was perfect. I can't eat dairy right now, so they left off the cheese  and made me a dairy-free pizza with sauce and vegetables. It was amazing! We'll be back!
__label__5	Went here Friday night and was pretty busy for this small bar. Loved this cocktail bar. Great drinks and decor. Perfect Tom Collins. Top 2 favorite bar in tucson besides 47 Scott.
__label__5	Awesome rack of ribs. Best service we've had in USA. Fries were as good as we get in Australia. We'll be back. Beer cold and Garret our server made sure we were well looked after.
__label__5	"Love this place... they do a spin on food that's not what I've had at other Cuban places.

Have to try the Arroz Con Pollo with some yuca."
__label__5	"Best place in town for New York style pizza. You can taste that it's family owned. All the food is made with care and it shows. The family is great and the atmosphere is organized chaos. Gotta love it. 

Recommendations: 
- The Gladiator 
- ANY slice of pizza
- Meatlovers roll 
- Meatball sub"
__label__5	This was my 1st time at the restaurant. I was really impressed. The steak and grits was delicious. And my server, Lauren G. was phenomenal. Thank you Lauren
__label__5	Would give 6 stars if I could, will be here for every special occasion until further notice! Despite my dietary restrictions, my meal was absolutely perfect.
__label__5	Food is great. People working there are super nice and very gracious. Got lunch and dinner from here while playing a show across the street at the rock. Took me back east for a bit. :)
__label__5	Gray's is one of my favorites in downtown Franklin.  The food is very good and has a more unique menu.
__label__5	"For a burger joint its pretty darn good! Fresh, warm food. Burgers made to your liking. Taco salad pretty good too and the prices are low! Great milkshakes. Ive had butterfinger, heath, salted pretzel, all great snd HUGE! I shared with hubby! 
Super friendly and great customer service!"
__label__5	Chad is officially my favorite brewer, and my only problem when I visit Two Frogs Brewing Company is to convince myself to try something new, because I love the Snowmass Chocolate Coconut Brown Ale, and the Admiral Nelson Barleywine, and the Ganache Imperial Porter, and the Green Mountain Maple Porter so much. We are so impressed with the flavors that Chad creates!
__label__5	Go there, get the hangover pizza and maybe get two because you'll eat it. But be sure to save room for the cheesecake. Trust me it's worth it.
__label__5	Great adventure for our family. Especially fun and exciting for our 5yr. old. The cave is warm so long sleeve shirt will suffice.
__label__5	Oh gosh! I love this pizza so very much.  I give myself a tummy ache every time I eat there , because it is so delish ! Love the sauce !!
__label__5	Fantastic dining experience with Sam and his team last night. The communication was great and the set up was top notch! We will be back!!!
__label__5	I was in town for a business trip and staying at the Westin, which is right across the street. This was easily the best craft beer bar that I've ever been in. They have a gigantic assortment of taps and bottles, hard-to-find microbrews, seasonals, and one-offs. The food was average, but I will go to the Flying Saucer anytime that I'm in a city that has one. If you're going for the beer, you won't be disappointed.
__label__5	My favorite place to go for birthdays, anniversaries, graduations, and any celebrations. The salad is simply delicious and the pickled beets are always a hit.  I prefer the fried chicken but my husband enjoys the steaks.  Every time I eat here I am pleased with the service and the food. I highly recommend this restaurant.
__label__5	This was our first visit to the Mallory Lane Shane store and we were pleasantly surprised. My fiancée and I went in to have some adjustments done to our engagement ring and were taken care of right away and were treated with great respect. Casey Blount was super helpful, kind and respectful of our budget and listened carefully. He was genuine and cared about what we wanted and acted promptly.  We will be driving up from Atlanta to put the finishing touches on our ring!  Everyone else we encountered in the store was also very pleasant to work with during our visit.
__label__5	I always need my clothes tailored and am so happy I found Rebecca!!!! Her prices are very reasonable and she is extremely talented at her craft!  I've had at least 5 garments tailored now and have been pleased every time!
__label__5	Great food and awesome atmosphere!  Loved our front row seat to watch the USF Ice Bulls! Our server Callie was on point and catered to our every need!  We'll definitely be back.
__label__5	"Chicken Yakitori 4/5
Korean Wings 5/5 
Jefferson Roll (Shrimp tempura) 4/5
Pennsylvania Roll (Sweet potato) 5/5"
__label__5	"This place is Kosher!!

My B.F got Chocolate Malt, and I got Strawberry shortcake... which had a fluffy sponge on the bottom and lots of Strawberry sauce n Whipped cream.... HEAVEN!!!
I want to try everything on the menu! Super delicious Icecream (I mean Custard)!!!!"
__label__5	"Wow hidden in fort Harrison in downtown Clearwater Hispania tapas bar and cafe is a must visit.  If you are interested in having authentic food from Spain this is the place to go.  Staff was super friendly and attentive.  Atmosphere is excellent, they even have live music on select nights.  They have a nice lunch menu for 10$
  I had a chicken empanada which was a nice size.  It was full of spiced chicken which I would definitely recommend.  Then I had the chorizo paella which was delicious!  It also comes with a drink.  I will definitely be returning to this restaurant."
__label__5	Love love loved city tap house!  Food is amazing here, you need to try the chicken and waffles.
__label__5	Great food. A bit crowded and loud but we had a good time! My husband got the loaded potato wedges and I got the tri tip burger we both were impressed!
__label__5	This place was amazing. It didn't look like much, but we went to a place close to where our daughter was-based as a Marine in Belle Chasse. We loved it and went back multiple times, each time was better than the next.She's out of the military now, but we still talking about going back just for Lil G's!!!
__label__5	This is the best Italian food in St. Louis.  Celebrities and athletes go there and they definitely have better information than most most.  The toasted ravioli was awesome.  I had chicken marsala and it was fantastic.  A friend had the chicken parmigiana and is was gigantic and looked great.  Decent beer and wine selection too!  It is very low key and had a cozy feel... will definitely come back next time I am in town.
__label__5	The Burger Time on Orchard is back up and running - with new owners - and the food is fantastic!!! Fresh and made to order. Their menu has some old favorites and some new twists - with a Hawaiian spin. (The new owners also operate a Hawaiian/Teriyaki food truck). I had the Flyin' Hawaiian - with katsu-style breaded chicken, pineapple, swiss cheese, teriyaki sauce and candied bacon. It was phenomenal! I can hardly wait to go back! My husband had a double-patty burger with pulled pork and he thought it was terrific.
__label__5	What a great little ice cream parlor in Chester Springs! We were visiting from CA and were taken there by our friend who lives nearby. The ice creams were delicious. But the real gem was the owner himself. He came out from behind the counter to introduce himself and even gave us some free samplings of his super delicious ale/stout ice cream. There was a steady stream of customers coming into the shop while we were there. Hopefully word is getting around about this shop.
__label__5	Amazing service. I called ahead because my son has an allergy. The manager answered all of my questions and even called me back to make sure he got it right. When I walked in they instantly recognized that my son was the one with a soy allergy. They were able to tell us what we can order and made sure the chef knew how to cook it. They made this visit an extremely enjoyable dining experience.
__label__5	"Visited: Thursday - February 26, 2015 - 11:30 AM

This is an overall review from my roughly 20 year membership. 

The tellers and loan officers are professional but, pleasant.

The on-line teller is user friendly

The offices are clean, bright, and welcoming.

There is plenty of parking.

Brief but, to the point"
__label__5	Everyone knows this place is a required stop on the way home from Clearwater Beach. If you're not from town you 100% need to try this. My personal favorite is the mango ice, but the flavors change frequently so there's plenty to try.
__label__5	"If you are looking for best impression paintings by greatest artists, this is the place to visit!

Dr Barnes collections make MOMA and Met museum collection an elementary level.  According to an estimate, these paintings are worth 3 to 4 billions!"
__label__5	I think today was the grand opening and I waited in line and it was so worth it!  The ice cream was so delicious - I had the Pumpkin w/ Gingersnaps, which made a perfect milkshake.  And I got the classic grilled cheese which was really good.  Can't wait to try the Philly steak one.
__label__5	So I happy I found one near where I live and the quality is about the same if not better than the one on Campbell!
__label__5	"Stopped in for a quick breakfast to go. Got the bacon, egg and cheese on a croissant-and, no lie-it was the best breakfast sandwich I have ever had! The bacon (and tons of it)was crisped to perfection, eggs scrambled just right and the cheddar was sharp and all melted and delicious. It's my new ""go to"" place! Highly recommend."
__label__5	Mmmmmmmm is all I can say. My and my fam come here every week. They have every food. It all taste amazing. The burger is jus icy and fresh. Me and my boo alway I order the prime rib.
__label__5	Hubby and I thoroughly enjoyed our evening here! We showed up on a Saturday evening without a reservation but we were still able to be seated within a matter of minutes. It is a small restaurant but we loved the cozy atmosphere. I had the red curry salmon which was delicious but I also couldn't keep my fork away from my husband's spicy noodles!!! Phenomenal!! I plan on making regular trips here, ordering takeout, having it delivered....Whatever it takes for me to explore their entire menu!! A-plus in my book!!
__label__5	"Loved the garlic knots! Calzone were amazing! Great flavor and crust! We ordered an XL Meat Lovers and it was one of the best I have tasted! 

Definitely will recommend!"
__label__5	"Unbelievable ice cream  flavors!! We had the pleasure of staying in a wonderful Airbnb for 6 weeks and one of the best parts was Lulu's was directly in front of Seashells!  Lulu, the owner, is one the of most friendly ladies you will ever meet and her flavorful ice cream is just the right treat for any day of the week.  

Of course the best flavor is the Lulu!! Make sure and stop by if you are visiting Indian Shores as you will not regret it!  Absolutely DELICIOUS and a DELIGHT to visit."
__label__5	"Hands down the BEST tomato pie I've eaten. I'm from north Jersey so I love pizza. The first time I tried tomato pie I wasn't sold. But then we decided to order a pie from here this weekend and it was amazing. The sauce to crust ratio was perfect and the sauce tasted so good.

We also got the pepperoni bread which was equally delicious. It's basically like a calzone. 

 I'm kinda mad at myself for trying this place because now I'm going to want to go every week!! I can't wait to go back."
__label__5	First time trying this place out we got the homemade chicken mole enchiladas (my fav), steak fajitas and shrimp ceviche which we were skeptical to order ,but were pleasantly surprised. Washed it all down with homemade horchata. Our server was very polite and attentive will definitely be back!
__label__5	This was an amazing experience! All the food and cocktails were amazing. Great atmosphere! I highly recommend.
__label__5	Too trill triva brings me to Ace Hotel every second Monday! Doors open at 6 and the games start at 7! More Girlfriends than Seinfeld and more fun for me since I can finally win trivia lol
__label__5	Excellent prices on breakfast burritos. I stop in on average twice a month for one and every time the morning staff is friendly a quick. Have also had lunch a few times over the last 6 months and that was excellent, both price and taste. Luckily my office is right around the corner so I get to stop here often.
__label__5	"Had the Pork Sandwich which was the best one I have ever had.
The sandwich had tons of flavor, not greasy. The house made fries were awesome.
Would highly recommend...........Can't wait to get back and try the short rib sandwich!"
__label__5	This location is always on top of it! The management walks around making sure that the customers are happy and they are legitimately listening to any concerns. The restaurant is always packed inside and outside, so expect a bit of a wait after ordering (15 mins is average). Well worth the time to enjoy with the rest of the table guests with cold drinks. Margaritas by the pitcher adds to the enjoyment!!! Brooke was such an awesome server that paid very close attention to every request, fabulous service from this young lady.
__label__5	Love this place will definitely be back we ordered the lamb shank the fisherman's pot pie and cottage pie all were excellent! My favorite part was actually the half and half Guinness on draft and harp so creamy and smooth. Would love to see if this place has Irish thing long time.
__label__5	Delicious food phenomenal prices. What more do you want? Oh yeah a beer? Well they just opened a location on northern Mass Ave that has the coolest beer tapping machine you have ever seen. It will blow your mind. I will not ruin the magic. Also quick tip try whatever you want before ordering. The staff is always really cool and they don't advertise it but you CAN and are encouraged to try any entree before ordering. It is very different from the traditional midwest food but it is worth a shot at under $8.00 for an entree who can beat that?
__label__5	Good stuff. Had the ravioli in white sauce. Price was high, but that is how this FRESH stuff cost.. Oh, and its not ready in 2 minutes, so stuff takes time..
__label__5	I love the historic feel to this place. Every last detail looks like it was preserved in a time capsule and just now opened. The uniforms of the employees definitely contributes to the vibe. We came in here for a late-night snack. Too bad it was too cold to try out their ice cream. We had a nice hot apple cider and some pie. I enjoyed sitting in the room and taking in all the sights.
__label__5	Friendly and knowledgeable staff. Helped us a great deal when planning our front and backyard landscaping. Heading back today for garden plants. Love the quality and people!
__label__5	Absolutely cool wonderful experience.   The food service environment was incredible.  Bring your wallet, You are going to need it!!
__label__5	What a gem. Went here for the first time tonight. Food is great! Staff is great! JorDan our greeter was very welcoming. Later I found out he was one of the owners even though he calls him self the manager and works as hard as his staff. Johnny our bar tender knew my name before I had even spoken to him. Anastasia our server was great, we waited for nothing. Top notch service. All hard working people making a relaxing evening just that. To top it off amazing food! Sonoran Dogs were done perfectly, toasted buns bacon wrapped hot dog with all the toppings.
__label__5	"Laid back haven of Frenchman Street tranquility (but then it was a Wednesday).
I ate Udon Don that will probably be my personal definition of good Udon Don for the rest of my life."
__label__5	Incredible. Every single time I go I am happy with the food and the customer service not to mention the cool and saavy atmosphere they have created. It is on the pricier side but it's worth every penny!
__label__5	"Cute hot dog stand in 5points. They have a good variety of choices and delicious flavors! 

I enjoy that they have outdoor seating and they even have a brunch weenie on Sundays (yum). 

Perfect for a quirky stop, a drunken snack, or a perfect meal for hotdog lovers."
__label__5	Great service and cupcakes. I contacted them the Monday of the same week I needed an order of 2 dozen mini red velvet cupcakes. I was able to place the order online, select a pick up time and be in and out with no problem. The cupcakes were a little browner than I expected so I had to try one and make sure It was red velvet and not chocolate but It was! The cream cheese frosting with the red velvet cake was a great pairing. Not too thick not too sweet. I would order again.
__label__5	This gorgeous historic restaurant is a Tampa Treasure.  I love taking out of state company to this world famous landmark.  The decor is stunning. The food is world class. Lots of parking. The prices are reasonable. The photos are memorable. They also have a great show you can book to see.  Dinner & a Show Cuban Style. Awesome.
__label__5	I love this place! Me and my husband visit often. I would rate this best Italian in/around New Orleans. The sauce is homemade , very sweet. Caesar dressing is also homemade. Service is outstanding! I recommend asking to be in Lisa's section.
__label__5	"The large cheese board + a bottle of wine = 3 hours of one hell of a nice time.

Their selection is impeccable. Their simplicity is perfection. 

Their knowledge is amazing. The experience is a must.

Counting the minutes until our next time we people watch as we nibble and nibble on delicious cheese. It was quite inexpensive too. I think we got out of their with a $40 bill and fully satisfied."
__label__5	It was so good and so close to my room I went twice. I still think about this chicken. The staff is friendly and cops eat here.
__label__5	Mannnn oh man oh man!! This place was everything the reviews said it was to be. I come in town for work a lot and wanted to try something different the reviews were on POINT! The hot chicken Mac and cheese was delicious! I got the Nashville got chicken the other chicken is like buffalo chicken strips! Ppl kept saying oh this is hot I have had way hotter food guess it depends on your tolerance. I enjoyed my drink and the server as well I definitely will be back
__label__5	Wow! This place is awesome!! Everything looked amazing, the service was excellent, friendly, quick, & delicious
__label__5	My go to place for lunch when I am shopping at La  Encentata. They have a super express lunch that combines a pizza and salad. The strawberry Gorgonzola salad can't be beat . Serval varieties of pizza and I have never had one that was not made to perfection. Service is always very attentive.
__label__5	Amazing service, friendly staff... in all it was a great experience. We used to go to Reeves because it's 10 minutes away, but after seeing the difference I have no problem with the 50 minute drive! Totally worth it! Go see Ryan and Alexis!
__label__5	"The hand drawn noodles from here are my obsession.  

This place is absolutely legit. So freaking good...

Egg noodles, beef brisket, sour fermented veggies,touch of sriracha...with a fried egg.
MMMMMMM....

The service is fast. The price is cheap. 

I rest my case."
__label__5	Cool friendly place with a type of food I had not tried before and also is in the back of a liquor store with a giant TV with football on it, so, good!
__label__5	Delicious fresh without the guilt. Fresh veggies and no greasy taste. Sweet potato fries were delicious. Caprese salad amazing and grilled chicken wrap was very tasty also. Very clean and quaint place.
__label__5	We've been dying to have a real NY style pizza place downtown and we've finally got it. First visit to the new location downtown. True NY style deliciousness. Ready on time and hot. New location 5743 Main St. next to Johnny Grits. Will be our go to place downtown now.
__label__5	Best diner in town! Fresh and healthy food options. Has all the diner favorites but with a homemade taste. I eat here frequently and I've never been disappointed with any of the menu items I've chosen.
__label__5	I honestly do not know what Edgehill would do with Fido. A staple as long as I can remember being a student in the Edgehill area, Fido always comes through for lunch or as a quick snack in between everyone's busy schedules. The sweet potato biscuit was one of my faves, but usually I will go for a egg dish and coffee.
__label__5	"We used the Night Kitchen bakery for our wedding cake and it was a fantastic hit with everyone who attended! It is the best cake we have ever tasted, so much so that we are getting a duplicate of our top tier to celebrate our anniversary! 

We also used them for my husband's groom cake - it exceeded all of my expectations! 

Highly recommend them for any and all cake needs!"
__label__5	Just ate here for the first time tonight was absolutely amazing like every review before this!!!! Cannot wait to go back and try everything else they have the offer which is alot from Candy, a delicious meal, fresh smoothies to pots and pans!!
__label__5	"This was a great find
quick delicious tacos downtown
looking forward to it opening in Abington"
__label__5	It's a bar that serves food, absolutely delicious food!! We almost didn't stay, because it's a bar. We decided stay because we were starving and we didn't want to look for another restaurant. FOOD IS ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!! I got the shrimp dinner and the shrimp were huge! I got about 8. Daughter got fried chicken. She said it was the BEST!
__label__5	We had such a fun time at the summit and meadows. The best part is that we could have our dog sliding with us.
__label__5	We stopped in while in the area and were glad we did.  Our waiter was friendly and when we asked if they had a veggie egg roll or spring roll he said he could get us some off menu.  They were crispy and delicious!!!  We ate moo goo gai pan and chicken with mixed vegetables and both were flavorful and generous portions.  Very good!  If you have an urge for good chinese or vietnamese this is the place.
__label__5	My wife and I chose this restaurant for proximity, we walked from the home we are renting.  What a treat, I love ahi tuna and this menu had numerous choices.  My wife ordered a special with lobster, scallops, salmon and sole.  She said it was the best sole she had ever had.  Excellent but small wine list.  Dessert was a baked Brie and Gorgonzola with fresh fruit served with espresso. Yes,the bill was large, but worth the price.
__label__5	The office personal that attended me was extremely pleasant and thorough in explaining everything. She walked me to my unit showed me how to open, close and had me even test out the lock so I was sure on how to use it. I have rented from other locations, but I have to say this place has been the best I have used so far. I would highly recommend it.
__label__5	Cinco de Mayo 2019 . Here my Hubby and I go . Lots of fun today . It was a very lively crowd and the vibe was just right. I believe every one had a great time . The food , drinks , and music was good . We ran into a few friends and we all had FUN !!!!!
__label__5	Great food! I had the milkfish it ws fried perfection! Pair it with garlic butter rice and then with shrimp chips! Your set!  I had halo halo for dessert!! Supreme! With an option of mango or banana turon( crispy crepes like eggroll style) top with taro(ube) ice cream!! Its the best! Worth the price! It would be great if it was bigger! i would recommend and definitely would come back!
__label__5	So good!  Chicken, bison, any kind of burger you could want with just about anything on top of it. Great choice of fries and other sides. Top that off with ice cream or boozy milkshakes. Did I mention a full bar and friendly, fun staff?
__label__5	The food and service here are always great! The crab dip is wonderful! I have tried a few different things on the menu and have never been disappointed! My favorite is the coconut shrimp, the dipping sauce makes the whole thing even better!
__label__5	Rudy and his movers did an excellent job for my move. They completed it in record time and were really friendly and professional. Also, the communication was great which made me feel more comfortable as you obviously want to know your movers are going to show up on your moving day! Thank you to Rudy and his team!
__label__5	The most amazing soup dumplings ever, totally packed with flavor and love. Highly recommend you come check this new spot out. The owner is super nice & the spot is cute and welcoming.
__label__5	Beautiful boutique hotel. Brejon was excellent.  Both the rooftop bar and castille made excellent beverages.  Lovely.
__label__5	I've been going to Fashion Stitch for years.  I enjoy seeing Yan and feel very confident that she can do any kind of alteration.  She is always sweet and professional.  When I did get married, I went there for a lot of alterations and she did a remarkable job for a wonderful price.  Very glad to have someone I can go to and trust.  Thank you, Yan.
__label__5	Great bar. Red headed bartender was good and almost funny. Get the lasagna, delicious.  Definitely come in for it. Best food I've had in the quarter.
__label__5	"Needed some things moved from my home and this couldn't have been done any better.

They were extremely easy to work with and did a phenomenal job. They said they would arrive between 4-6 and they did. We had several items and they were in and out in less than 20 minutes.

It is very reasonably priced as well which is also appreciated."
__label__5	"We haven't been here in years and we are so glad that we came back. The Birds in Flight show is unbeatable and we also saw Fur, Feathers and Fangs, a live show that talks about some of the different animals and was fun and informative. 
We have decided that the Desert Museum will go on our must visit list every time we visit Arizona."
__label__5	"Excellent burger at fork. My wife and I split it while I had a nice glass of wine and we share the fries too. 
We had a traffic bartender, but I cannot remember her name at the moment.
I would definitely recommend the spot and I would definitely go back. It help me fall in love with Boise"
__label__5	I can't say enough great things about this place. Our waitress was great! Our food was perfect. We are visiting from Texas. Tried a few restaurants that were seen on tv etc. none of them were clean, had good service or good food. I definitely recommend this place. I would give it 10 stars if I could. Best food in Indianapolis so far!
__label__5	"The waitress is so friendly and really patient and tends to her customer needs very well. Food was quick and delicious will be back thank you so much!!

I had the curry puffs for an appetizer and shrimp pad Thai for lunch. Everything was as requested and wonderful! This new little Thai spot will undoubtably do well!"
__label__5	"Just.  Go.  Service - outstanding and personable.  Food - spot on, as in "" little party in the taste buds. Wallet - not too bad. The local brew on tap and menu selection along with the menu selections is just what you want.  
Great place, ambiance, and super clean."
__label__5	Came in for a part. They had only one. I needed 4 more. He said he thinks he has another part that would work and come back and look at it. We found a perfect match. Package of 24 cost me significantly less than buying 5 packages of the other by 65% and he saved me several trips to other O'Reillys looking for more. That's great service.
__label__5	Just recently moved into the neighborhood and this is my go-to deli. The staff is awesome and very helpful (I often ask what types of kielbasa are good for what). The food is fresh and delicious. Really can't go wrong.
__label__5	I live in Southern California where there are real Mexican restaurants.  This place is legit.
__label__5	Great beer selection, stupid cheap pricing on beer and liquor. Food is varied and all super delicious. 10/10
__label__5	Super friendly and helpful sending flowers for a friend.   Arrangement very cute in a Campbell's Chicken Noodle soup mug.  Would contact again.
__label__5	"Great staff ...great food ... large portions ..might have to share !  they care about there customers ..
Management present and caring !"
__label__5	We came for a last minute meal with our pup on the patio. Unfortunately our pup knocked the table over and our server Joe was so understanding. 5 stars for the service and not making it feel like a big deal. Food was great as always!
__label__5	These guys are the real deal. Called them yesterday and they were here the next day when they said they would be. Had a series of small things done to add life to my garage door. Took less than an hour and Dan was done.  Can't comment too much on the price, seemed fair for all I had done and it was worth the peace of mind.  Also, they don't overcharge for a new remote, basically at cost. I now have a garage door repair company for life. Good local company, I highly recommend them.
__label__5	Very cool brewery and awesome setting. Had a live band when I was there that was very good. Their beer is also delicious.
__label__5	If you like eating amazing fried chicken, great service, and cool atmosphere, then this is the place for you. The best food I have eaten in Indy so far. Also shout out to the bar manager, he knows how to treat customers, give him a raise!
__label__5	Great food and service!  The crab cakes were wonderful and the Cajun fries were amazing!
__label__5	"I dropped off a rare Fender electric mandolin and a Vox wah pedal.  Was hoping for a little more $, but, man, it was an awesome experience! Great customer service.  Ask for Anton...great dude.  They even have a BTC ATM in shop...ingenious! Cheapest interest rates in the USA!!

HIGHLY recommended."
__label__5	Cool and funky historic building. Great merchandise and helpful staff--especially Kayla! Gift items, gorgeous live plants and gift items in addition to floral arrangements.
__label__5	"My wife had the ""egg plant love potato"", and I sneaked a taste of both of the ingredients.  We both agreed that the taste was spectacular.  I had the house lo mein, to test their noodles (wife's dish came with rice, unfortunately).  Best lo mein ever! WONDERFUL home-made noodles.  We will be back, as soon as I can record it on my GPS!"
__label__5	I can not say enough good things about Dina. I have massages from her for over a year and my mobility has greatly increased. Dina listens to my concerns and focuses on where there are problem areas. I had a stroke a couple years back,so my legs.specifically my calfs give me problems. Dina's techniques of loosening the muscles and stretching the legs make me feel like a new man. If you were in the room next door, you would here hear some loud grunts of pain, but she only massages as deep and hard as you like. I highly recommend Dina
__label__5	Not only was the smoked salmon Benedict fabulous but the service (talking to you Courtney) was outstanding! The location is quaint- a nice walk from our hotel on Broad St. We found it on Diners Drive Inns and dives. We had a great weekend in Philly and this was a highlight.
__label__5	Always on top of things! Food is delicious, portions are large, delivery is fast, and customer service is excellent!
__label__5	Very good drinks and bakery and dessert! Food is amazing! Idk why so many people go to the outdoor restaurant across the street next to the river. But this one is indoors and have better food! And warmer for this cold cold winter. I suggest you guys come here!
__label__5	"Bless this place. 

Reasons I am sad after coming here:
1. I only got to try the gelato
2. There is no sucre in NJ

I tried the basil coconut gelato as well as the triple chocolate. Oh my. Words and pictures will do no justice..my advice if you're anywhere in the area is: RUN (do not walk) to this cafe and make sure you order several items. 

Will be back here as soon as I can get back to NOLA"
__label__5	AMAZINGGGGGGGG! It hit my soul! Everything was delicious. I tried the wings, ribs, Mac & cheese and the baked beans. The mild sauce is to die for. Everyone at the restaurant is super friendly and welcoming. Will definitely be back! Best BBQ I Tampa. Yummyyyyy!
__label__5	"This Restarant was renovated, and reopened in October 2011.  It is under new ownership, and is wonderful!  All the previous reviews here are from the old place ( which was awful).  This place has great food.  It is not your average diner.  They have kicked it up a notch, with upscale healthy food.  I've been there a couple of times and loved it.  The veggie burger, the yellowfin tuna melt-panini, and turkey club were all terrific.
This is now truly a great neighborhood restaurant."
__label__5	"Delicious pizza! 

I ordered the Bianca pizza, which is ricotta, mozzarella, and fresh basil. It's a white pizza. I added goat cheese, olives, mushrooms, sausage, and fried eggplant. Oh my goodness! It was fantastic! Loved everything. The small was enough for me and leftovers!"
__label__5	Awesome food and music. Try the collards and brisket then finished with a buttermilk pie.
__label__5	Always a great experience here! Absolutely love their Fiery Honey sauce, we add it to everything. We always get kind and professional service during each visit and the food is so so good! They have my favorite chicken wings in the area and I would also highly recommend their burgers
__label__5	Amazing ice cream!!!just when you think you've tasted the best... you find even better ice cream
__label__5	The staff at this location was very prompt and professional! The manager Samuel was very helpful and knowledgeable will definitely be back again.
__label__5	Just moved into my brand new studio after renting a different unit in the same complex with roommates for the last 5 years. The new building is amazing and I could not be happier with my decision. The amenities are great and the location is prime! Evelyn, Emilio, Chad, Bobby and the rest of the staff are always great! As being one of the first and longest standing residents of 5+ years, I can say living here has been absolutely amazing and I would recommend it to anyone!
__label__5	Very good hibachi and excellent service. It is very spacious and a BYOB! We will definitely be back!
__label__5	Just discovered this gem of a mechanic, honest, on time, and VERY through!   If you are looking for that small town mechanic who actually tells you the truth and fixes it right the first time this is your place!
__label__5	The staff and Docters are always friendly and caring. I have had four animals that go to see Dr. Cohan and I can't say enough positive things about him. I even moved out of the area 2 years ago, I tried another vet closer to my new home in South Philly but after a year I returned to Center City vet. They are great!
__label__5	Highly skilled technicians who are honest and friendly.  Reasonable pricing. Don't spend too much money going to dealership for your car trouble.  Go to Autobahn and save money!!!
__label__5	"This service is absolutely great, I always have the very best of experience.

Since the car is fantastic I usually only need to show up for the regular services. (Aside from that time we hit a bad pot hole...) 
Bobby P and Robert.S are very professional and I am very happy we bought a car at this place."
__label__5	We flew in and stayed at the Best Western by the airport. We went to the hotel lounge and our bartender suggested this place. We gave it a try and it was absolutely amazing! The breakfast poutine was insanely good! My girlfriend had biscuits and gravy with scrambled eggs and a single pancake. Everything was delicious. The atmosphere was very comfortable and inviting. Staff was perfect. She had a screwdriver mimosa and I had the breakfast punch. Both were stellar. Definitely worth trying out.
__label__5	Excellent service.  Walked in needing my daughter's iPhone cracked screen replaced and got a quick quote for the repairs.  Fixed like new.  Took about an hour to get the phone fixed.  Delivered on time and no up sells.
__label__5	Sit at the counter and have Greg give you a master class in pizza making. Great pizza with a focus on fresh ingredients.
__label__5	We've been coming to Sunrise since we moved here 5 & a half years ago. Manny and his staff are amazing. The food is the best. I've never had anything here I didn't like.
__label__5	Your perfect neighborhood pizza shop. I eat here all the time. They have great salads, and the buffalo chicken pizza fantastic. So far everything I've tried has been great. The service is awesome and its very reasonably priced. This spot has had 3 or 4 different owners since I moved to the neighborhood 5 years ago and Lazo's has definitely been the best.
__label__5	Blue ice is my favorite gelato in town. The owner one of the friendliest people and he recognizes his customers. I felt very safe when visiting during covid. All the tables and chairs are wiped down outside. The gelato is consistently smooth and packed with bold flavors. You'll get 10% off your order if you have a loyalty card. I appreciate the excellent service here. It is clean and accessible. Plenty of parking.
__label__5	Focus not only gives you a great full-body workout, but the people who work there are friendly, welcoming, and helpful. I am not a huge fan of working out, but the barre classes at Focus actually make me look forward to exercising. The first class is free and they have great class package purchase options. Definitely worth trying, you won't regret it!
__label__5	I loved this church. The worship team is do awesome. I felt relaxed and welcome. It's all about God
__label__5	Had the Southern Salad (aka chicken salad on a bed of greens) and a caramel macchiato frappe. There is nothing they could've done to improve either. Absolute perfection! The salad doesn't need dressing but if you want it I recommend the apple vinaigrette.
__label__5	"Such a cool building. This building was formerly a brewery, and is so cool. Multiple levels. Due to COVID and being a Monday afternoon, it was not busy. Practicing social distancing, very clean and sanitizing between customers. 
The Bankside was my favorite, it was so good. The Heff was good too. Bestie loved the coffee stout. 
We also had the chicken nachos, very good and just the right portion for two to share. 
You can purchase growlers and they even have a shop you can buy cans and bottles to take home.

__label__5	It has been 2  1/2 years since I worked a block away and fell in love with this place and the people who ran it. Today, I decided to stop by on the way home. Like the other recent reviewer says, it is closed on Monday. I hope this isn't because it is closed permanently. Can anyone confirm?
__label__5	"This inconspicuous spot is a great place to shop.  In addition to the groceries you can buy there, they offer delicious meals!  I frequent this place for the breakfast sandwiches.  I must commend them for having turkey bacon, as not all delis have a non-pork alternative for their customers.  

The staff who work there are very friendly, and are always polite when I walk in to shop.  I recommend stopping in and grabbing a bite if you ever have the chance."
__label__5	This restaurant is for real.  Moonstruck was tasteful, the ambiance was very appealing, the service was outstanding, the value to price was worth every penny.  We were there for my wife's birthday and she couldn't have been happier with the choice.  Who needs to go to center city when you this type of jewel right in the NE.  Simply put...OUTSTANDING...
__label__5	"We have been wanting to try E and E for awhile. Well we were not disappointed. From the moment we walked in the staff were very accommodating. Brad our server was very attentive, Explaining specials.
We were a group of six and he took fabulous care of us. From the cocktails to desset it was a meal that will have us coming back for more. The food was fabulous. From the Blackened Grouper to the Salmon and the ceasar salad was the best I ever had. Tell Brad thank you for making our evening even more special."
__label__5	I used TBC many years ago when my oldest was born. My birth experience was amazing. But more than the birth itself, Patty Siegrist, their IBCLC (lactation consultant) was a complete lifesaver. She has created a village of support in the Breastfeeding Support Groups that meet throughout the region. There I was given guidance from moms with older babies, met dear friends, and had Patty showing me the way. I have no idea how my nursing/parenting journey would have been without Patty's love and guidance!
__label__5	What can I say? I needed some stucco repair, which also led to painting one side of the house. They quoted an hourly rate and estimated the duration of the job. The rate was really reasonable and the estimate was dead-on. The technicians--one did the stucco and another did the painting--were simply the best. I look forward to counting on these folks whenever I have handyman work to be done around the house. Great!
__label__5	"Had to drive to this dealership from about 2 hours away for routine maintenance. Friendly welcoming staff and appointments that run on time. Maintenance was completed sooner than expected and they didn't try to sell us any unnecessary services- thank you! 
We will definitely spend the time to drive here for the honest fast and friendly service!"
__label__5	I've been frequenting this place since it was in its old location on 202, so I've eaten here many times. Few restaurants can offer good Vietnamese and Thai food simultaneously (in my opinion, usually one suffers while the other is much better). I've had their pho, which is excellent, and their Thai curry's, which are also excellent. The staff is extremely friendly, helpful, and the service is excellent. It's BYOB as well. If you love Vietnamese and Thai food, definitely eat here!
__label__5	service was a bit slow but the food surpasses that issue. The smoothies were good and food portions were great. Had the dominican breakfast and bunch of other things .
__label__5	I've been looking forward to seeing this place! Huge warehouse type of setting with multiple food vendors, a small food market, and an interesting choice of decor. There's food for all palates there & it's a nice multi-people hangout spot. The only downside is how packed it gets and difficulty in finding a good seat, if any at all. Parking is organized and plentiful. I enjoyed Graze restaurant and would recommend.  Portions are generous and the food is tasty. Their chicken and waffles, mac n cheese and their burgers are delish
__label__5	My friends and I went to hopdoddy after work together one day. We all got drinks which tasted fabulous and were strong. We also got the truffle fries which were absolutely delicious - ask for more sauce whenever you order! For parking - i would park on magnolia and walk if you and your party don't mind a bit of a walk. If not, I recommend parking in the garage near by.
__label__5	"Four of us visited Tucson and looked for a Brunch option. We read the Yelp reviews and decided to try this Cafe. We were greeted by a friendly waitress who took care of us though the place was busy. The cinnamon rolls were excellent, we all had very satisfying meals and the home made pies were both attractive and delicious. 
Thanks to the Yelp reviewers who lead us to this spot!"
__label__5	Very yummy fresh seafood! My husband and I shared the half seafood platter and so so good!! We got it fried. The broiled potatoes were a nice surprise instead of dinner rolls! Great place and love the old diner vibe it has going on!
__label__5	What an amazing place! I truly felt the spirit of bourbon street as I sat in the courtyard, sipped my hurricane, and listened to good music. My server was awesome and I love the souvenir glasses that you get to keep or turn back in for money (in true tourist fashion I kept mine of course). I went on a Monday so there was no wait (score) and after 3 hurricanes I wobbled back out to bourbon street happier than when I came in lol. Awesome experience and a must visit when in the French quarter.
__label__5	Got the customer service and deal we were looking for. Thanks SBM! 15% off further store purchases have and will come in handy.
__label__5	Stopped in to use the restroom and left with one of the best Arnold palmers of my life. The group got a mix of donuts, hot chocolate, and coffee. Everything really did taste good and made with some compassion. 10/10 recommend. Maybe I'll come back and try the sliders. They looked beautiful.
__label__5	Was up there Thursday night for dinner. Despite all the negative reviews this is been one of our best places to eat seafood. My wife and I got the dinner for two which is a large plate of calamari fish shrimp fries. It was the best!
__label__5	Food is always yummy!! I love the wraps, broccoli salad, and especially the white BBQ sauce!
__label__5	Great food and a full bar. The decor isn't the best but the authentic tasting food made up for that.  The parking isn't convenient since it's located close to 69th St. They accepted my 20% discount from Yelp but I made sure that I told the waitress about it before I got my food.
__label__5	"I have been going to this salon for well over 3 years and I will never step foot into another again! This salon is so beautiful inside, so Incredibly clean and every single nail tech does your nails absolutely STUNNING! I have never been disappointed with this salon and their work! 
Best nail salon in Tampa, hands down!"
__label__5	A must-try if you are looking for authentic northwestern Chinese food. We have been here quite a few times and tried a variety of dishes on the menu. Nothing has disappointed us. I love their noodle dishes, lamb kebabs, Chinese pork hamburgers, dumplings, soups, and etc. Walking distance from U of A, which was great :) the service is also great!
__label__5	Love the atmosphere and everyone is friendly. First timer here and had Riley. She was amazing and so kind. I asked many questions and she knew all the answers.Definitely going back to her:)
__label__5	"So the only reason this place is getting 5 stars is because of our server Shay, she is sweet, professional, honest, very helpful (with suggestions) friendly... 

The food is average. Nothing special. We had wings, fries and ribs. 

The atmosphere is lively."
__label__5	We love their brunch and it's great for families. The Shrimp & Grits, Eggs Betty, and the Southern Shakshuka are my favorites. My husband, who doesn't generally love omelets (but tried some of the ones I have ordered for the baby) says that theirs is the best he's ever eaten. They handle large groups easily. I also have done several business lunches and the atmosphere works really well for that, too. The biscuits with honey & berry jam are great nibblers and the Bloody Mary is very special!
__label__5	"This place is phenomenal,  I personally hate doing laundry their wash and fold is the best deal in town. They professionally and fold all of your shirts and then seal them in a plastic bag, it saves from having to hang t shirts which saves me tons of closet space as well.

The best part about soap opera laundry is the owners Kim and Bill. They are single handedly the nicest people you'll ever meet and they truly care about their business and their customers"
__label__5	Good looking and feeling suit and shirt. Aaron is cool and knowledgeable. He came to my office, which beats traffic and headache of going to the mall. Thanks man!
__label__5	By far thee best vet I have ever experienced. I am not rating on kenneling my animals, just their care as vets and staff. Incredible. They continue to impress me; all of the staff and vets! So blessed to have found Bentley in 2019!
__label__5	We had our destination Wedding in Santa Barbara and had our reception at the Crocodile Restaurant & Bar.  Almost everyone who attended the wedding & reception stayed at the Lemon Tree Inn including us.  Braulio the manager was amazing, he helped me with last minute reservations and was beyond accommodating to all our guests.  I have not any bad comments about the Lemon Tree or the Crocodile from anyone.  I think they will have many returning guest from our party.  Thank you Braulio!
__label__5	"Authentic?? How many times places claim this.  Let me start by saying I'm from California and I know ""authentic Mexican"" food. Since moving to Nashville I have yet to find ""authentic Mexican"" food. Until now - El Cubilete delivered!!! Finally!! Fresh made tortillas, properly seasoned meat and authentic Spanish rice. I had the poblano chicken while my boyfriend had what is basically their take on a Chile verde. Everything was delicious! Dint let the front scare you away. This was definitely worth the long drive. And, oh yes, we will be back!!"
__label__5	This restaurant is a nice little hidden gem, it's like a diner style with that type of cooking food was amazing it was quick service was very friendly I would definitely come here again
__label__5	We tried out White Limozeen this weekend and I was so impressed! The pink and pretty decor and rooftop city views were absolutely gorgeous! Between the 4 of us we probably tried every cocktail and they were all delicious. The staff was wonderful and so attentive. With COVID going on you have to make a reservation, which we did several weeks in advance. It was an excellent experience from start to finish. We will definitely be coming back!!
__label__5	Ani delivers AMAZING massages!  She is very sweet and communicative with what you need. I am thrilled to be closer to her for my massages.  She focuses on areas where it's most needed and uses all natural products to massage with.   I am very active in my lifestyle where I use my muscles alot but whenever Ani massages me,  I feel brand new the next day!!  I highly recommend you to go see her,  especially Her studio where its absolutely beautiful to get your massages done in.
__label__5	Excellent ambiance, service and great food!  Something for everyone.  The cocktails were well made and on point.
__label__5	Love this place. The food is fresh and original, the drinks good, the staff helpful, and the customers beautifully diverse.
__label__5	The menu sounded good, so we checked it out for dinner. It was perfection, and we plan to add it to our dinner and lunch rotation. I had the salmon / avocado savory cheesecake and my dinner partner had the Medittereneo pizza. We also had the black bread bruschetta and tiramisu. The service was also excellent. Run, don't mosey, to this restaurant.
__label__5	My go to nail salon in Goleta. Prices are great for the area, and the service is top notch! Ive done regular mani, pedi, and gel, and the results have all been great.  The receptionist was especially nice and handpicked colors for me when I didn't know what I wanted. WIll be back often
__label__5	"D'Angelo's is BY FAR the best place for breakfast in Santa Barbara. If their famous ""Eggs Rose"" doesn't knock you square on your keister then the french toast certainly will. It's a little on the pricier side but well worth it. The bread is baked fresh on location and most of the other items on the menu are homemade as well. I highly recommend eating here, but be aware they're fairly busy on weekends."
__label__5	Frank is a very finicky eater. He is raving about the burger meat at Roots Cafe'. He said it is the BEST burger he's ever had.
__label__5	"One of the few pizzas my 5yo will eat. Understated sauce, plenty of cheese, nice crust. Their wings are pretty mild, and decent sized for the price. Cheesesteaks were a treat. Plenty of meat, not much grease, an overall 10.

Add in friendly owners and you've got a place that can't be beat - well, except for the parking - but you can't really fault them for that.  :-)"
__label__5	Stopped in here when we got to town last night.  Margarita was perfect and the fish tacos were some of the best ever!   We will be back again.
__label__5	"One of my favorite places to watch a sunset. Not a bad drive from home (S. Tampa) and everything is a WIN: grouper eggrolls, tuna sashimi, coronas with lime, music, sunset, staff, water views. 

Parking is a PAIN IN THE ASS...would love to get a spot without driving around and around for a half-hour. But everyone is there for a reason. 

Highly recommend."
__label__5	"It doesn't get better than a Martin's burrito. Add free pinto bean smothered chips, a cup of jamaica, and the best Mexican wrestling inspired decor and find out why Martin's is in my top five favorite places to eat in the world. 

The soy chorizo with eggs burrito could possibly be the worlds most perfect burrito but they are all good. Street tacos, tortes, and mole are also excellent. If you haven't tried Martins then you should hurry up and get some."
__label__5	"I am beyond excited about the arrival of Teapioca Lounge.  Their extensive menu and large beautiful lounge space make it somewhere I plan on visiting frequently.  The service was very friendly and I am so happy to have a local place that adjusts sweetness.

The touch table is great to keep kids busy but I want to sit down and play with it too.  Congratulations on your Grand Opening!  I am definitely celebration your arrival!"
__label__5	Chain restaurants are never my thing, but the happy hour is legendary. Showed up here with a tank top on not realizing there's a dress code. The hostess was very accommodating in trying to find me appropriate attire. I declined, but considering I was the asshole in this situation, I really appreciated how the staff here handled it and I'll show up here more appropriately dressed next time.
__label__5	Don't be fooled cuz it's in a strip mall- this is a true PA diner.  They have all the standard diner fare, great prices, and the kind of food that makes you wanna go home after brunch and take a nap.  Cream chipped beef made from scratch tops my list of must have diner cuisine and they have it, and it's delicious.  Superb.
__label__5	"Stopped in last night for dinner.  Sat outside.  Was only here once before for happy hour a while ago.  
Started with the deviled eggs and they were delicious!  I ordered a cheeseburger with a side salad.  I expected the salad to be on the plate with the burger, how places normally serve it.  It came in it's own bowl and it was a large salad!  So big that I ate that and brought my burger home!"
__label__5	The staff are very helpful and friendly. I got my first wetsuit from here and am extremely happy with the purchase. Thank you A-Frame Surf!
__label__5	I bought some Christmas gifts from here and the women in the store was extremely knowledgeable and helpful. The store sells high quality items and has a great selection.
__label__5	THE BAKERY in Nashville. Great pastries, great sandwiches. Clean, professional, and fast. Definitely would go again!
__label__5	It's Hooter's......always good! Pretty girls, good food, TV, drinks, casual, etc
__label__5	"Frenchmen St is my favorite spot in New Orleans and I think Spotted Cat is the best place to start a club crawl.  The bands are amazing and it is shocking that they're only playing for tips.  I love the feel of this place - great music, friendly people, cheapish drinks.

It's cash only but there is an ATM right in the bar.  And no drinks or drunks on the pianee!! :)"
__label__5	We took jet skis out today and this is absolutely the best jet ski rental I have ever done. Extremely friendly and helpful staff. We would have stayed longer if we had time. If you are thinking about renting jet skis, you should absolutely rent from the them. You will not regret it! Thank you cap n Dave's!!!!
__label__5	Long wait but so worth it! For the amount of people in the shop, and orders they were doing, delanct st bagels employees were on top today!! They took my bagel order and were quick in preparing it. It was sooo fresh and tasty today despite their business. Also Rhiani was running the coffee counter like a pro! She calmly took orders and still had plenty of kindness and personality. A wonderful experience as always.
__label__5	Went for lunch, the food was hot and fresh when we received it. I had the steak, onions and cheese on Cuban bread. All in all good for lunch...
__label__5	"Love this place! I was preparing for a move to Nashville but realized I didn't have a paddle board rack the day before I was supposed to leave. They were the only sporting goods place left in Boise that had one. They also had a promotion going on where you got ten ""mcu bucks"" for every $100 you spend. Since I wasn't going to be in town when they were redeemable, they took the money off my paddle board rack. I even got free installation! ($50 at REI.) Wish I had discovered this place long before I moved."
__label__5	While promising DRAMA, this place delivers FINE ARTS in the form of an incredible menu, wafting appetite-catalytic aromas, and friendly-attentive service.  Can's wait to go back!
__label__5	Prince and Deshan moved me today. Expensive, but very smooth and accommodating. Thanks!
__label__5	"I love their cannoli (insert joke here: ""take the cannoli"" from the godfather, x-rated, etc.). The sfogliatelle were good too. I never liked cannoli before I tried this place, but I am now a convert. I want to try Termini Brothers some day, too."
__label__5	Wish there were more plces like this around. Good comfort food, non pretentious, excellent prices. I'll give the food an A-. Mac and cheese was a little on the bland side. Smoked Prime Rib and Chicken Pot Pie were very good. Place is tiny and cramped but servers do a good job of attending to everyone's needs. Good neighborhood joint.
__label__5	"Have used them on several occasions. We had to put our Rottie to sleep and they were the best very compassionate and gave us the time we needed with our 9yo Baby Rottie to say goodbye. 

They have also taken care of our Shepard for allergies and finally got us a flea medicine that work for her. They listened to us and helped our girl with her problems."
__label__5	Amber is amazing!! She is very professional, educated and clearly has a passion for hair. Highly recommend her for hair color - I'm obsessed
__label__5	"We are in town for just weekend and friends ask us to meet them at ""the livery""
Great Atmosphere waiter was Tyler he did a great job keeping beer full and food was amazing had empanada cheese husband had enchilada Pacifico beer which we loved when we were in California so that's a plus"
__label__5	I'm biased but it's the best fried food around! I love the wings, jumbo shrimp, seafood salad and more! and they have fresh seafood and steamed crab legs!
__label__5	Hamburgers are fantastic! The Build-Your-Own option is a better deal than the regular burger options. I love the comp lemon/cucumber water.
__label__5	Very pleased in finding this place.  Decour is what you would expect in a cigar lounge and the beer selection is on par with my favorites.  They have wine as well.   The bartender Chantel (?) was very helpful and attentive.  I highly recommend stopping by.
__label__5	Sat at the bar for appetizers and cocktails.  We had the Tavern Mussels and they were so delicious!  Very friendly staff; hostess and bartender made us feel welcome.  Will definitely keep coming back!
__label__5	This place is off the chart good... The burnt ends brisket and pork is almost is good as mine.  If you ever have the chance to stop in and experience this incredible bbq you owe to yourself.  Their desserts are also a must try.  Take one home because you will be too full from the meal.
__label__5	Yesterday you closed your doors...I know many, many of us in the community are heartbroken...I look forward to seeing what location you pop up with downtown in the future!
__label__5	We had a slow leak in one of our tires.  I called Big Brand and talked with Christopher who was very pleasant and very helpful.  He set us up as a walk in client to get the tire fixed.  When we arrived, Sam (also very pleasant and helpful) got us checked in and in queue to get the tire fixed.  About 75 mins later, we were back and ready to enjoy the rest of our stay in Santa Barbara.  Thank you to a great team of folks!
__label__5	I have to give Terry Bowman a million thank yous for fixing my bent glasses today!!! These were my only pair of glasses and they got bent and unwearable on this same day that I was going to pick my Mom up from the hospital. He saved me a lot of extra work and stress without even knowing what a blessing his kindness and exceptional customer service was to me. Thank you, thank you, thank you Terry!!! I highly recommend Today's Eyewear for all your glasses and eyewear needs. Today's Eyewear is a first class business!!!
__label__5	Our favorite breakfast/lunch place closed.  We found Caleb's American Kitchen thanks to our favorite server Cheryl. Now we can't imagine going anywhere else. Everything is fresh farm to table delicious food. There are always amazing specials. We've tried almost everything and its always wonderful and delicious! ( and healthy)!!
__label__5	Num num num. smothered fries are a must. Tastes extraordinary well on the palette. The combination of cheeses and meats is top notch. The atmosphere is just wonderful. Bring an empty stomach and fill it with scrumptious food!!!! :)
__label__5	Great service, tasty tea and coffee, fast internet, nice location and ambient! I love coming to study here. They also offer brunch/breakfast foods until 2PM. Restrooms are available right down the hall, and they have sitting outside as well as inside. It is a super cozy place and surely one of my favorites coffee shops in the city of Boise.
__label__5	First time ive ever been here the owners were amazing. The shop had a ton of stuff for a smaller shop. My new favorite shop i will deffinatly go out of my way to make sure i shop there as much as i can.
__label__5	Unbeatable hair care at unbeatable prices! Came a few weeks ago for haircut- for just $16 (or 12 without styling), my stylist who was only weeks away from graduation gave me a lovely blunt long layered cut. She also curled my hair with a blow dryer! I'm excited to schedule color here soon :)
__label__5	Stumbled in here fairly late on a Saturday night, an was very impressed!  I had the ribeye sandwich and it was amazing!  Our server, Noah, was phenomenal...great personality, great attention paid to our needs without being overbearing, and he made excellent suggestions (including the candied bacon appetizer and the peach BBQ sauce)!  I'll definitely be back because there's a lot more I'd love to sample from the menu.
__label__5	Food, view, atmosphere and prices are amazing! Food quality was impeccable! We were eating our entrees in 15 minutes, Tabatha was our server and she was excellent! Five stars, great date spot!
__label__5	Simply the best sushi I have ever had. Yes the location is not the best, and the interior can be noisy/ have low ceilings but it is worth it! The ingredients taste fresh and of better quality.
__label__5	This Buffalo Wild Wings is most certainly the best location around the region! I highly recommend coming here if you want great customer service and your food and drinks to come out fast.
__label__5	Visiting from Boston and wandered in here after a tour. Ordered crawfish and had no idea how to eat it. My guy Neal sat with us for a full tutorial and went above and beyond for our group. The foods incredible too
__label__5	During my first visit I received great service provided by a very friendly, professional and knowledgeable staff. Dr. Solvi explained my current dental state very clearly and thoroughly. All treatment options were provided in writing including costs for treatments and what my insurance would cover or would not cover. I have been looking for a new dentist for two years and I am happy to have found Ruppel Dentistry. I will recommend them to friends.
__label__5	"You cannot beat the ""Happy Hour"" at Roman Delight .  drinks and apps all half price not to mention great bartender."
__label__5	Friendly and knowledgeable staff. They saw me right on time (rarity in these professions). Kelsey did a very nice job on my teeth and was gentle. Dr. Kang was awesome and very personable! I really like this new staff! Highly recommend this office!!
__label__5	We typically like to try a new BBQ place on our ride back to Atlanta and this was a great choice! The kid's mac and cheese was made with REAL cheese, the single catfish filet was sizeable and the pulled pork sandwich was tender and delicious. The best collards and slaw of any BBQ place we've been to. Oh and let's  not forget the amazing chocolate pie!
__label__5	This was my first time at Pane Rustica and it was honestly AMAZING!!! Our server Annie, was TOP NOTCH! She was super friendly and attentive! Gave us GREAT recommendations that were amazing! The food, the atmosphere, the service, EVERYTHING was amazing!!!!! Thank you so much Pane Rustica!
__label__5	I had my windshield replaced in Dec 2016. They were amazing and seriously had the best out of pocket prices for a 2010 Mazda 6. Unfortunately my bad car luck in July 2017 had me buying another new windshield after 2 rocks on the same day cracked my windshield beyond repair. Called Safelight who wanted to rob me almost $400 more. Returned to Auto glass now. Got amazing customer service an unbeatable price and a company I would return to time and time again. You all are amazing.
__label__5	"Jack's has been a favorite of mine for about 2 years.  I like the variety on the menu, and the quality of everything.  the service is always quick and courteous and the price is quite reasonable.

I have introduced several friends to Jack's and they have all been as taken with the place as I am.  

Be sure to try the Scotch Egg."
__label__5	I'd say this place is tied for best club in the city, with cheerleaders.  Friendly staff and dancers, everyone is always super welcoming. Dancers are pretty cool people and not rude like show n tel(the actual worst!) they have some pretty great drink specials throughout the week, and a good happy hour. Bar service has been hit or miss, mostly good, but have been straight up ignored by some of the younger bartenders. The veterans though are excellent, as a bartender myself I notice these things.  Treat yourself to a lap dance here.
__label__5	My husband and I just love this place! The food is so fresh and love their daily specials. The Frittatas are to die for! The staff is super friendly and the ambience is just very chic. I am not a vegan but their vegan bowl is something you would love on a day you wanna eat clean! Definitely recommend this place!
__label__5	The cutest little concept coffee shop I've ever been to. The drinks are delicious and I LOVED getting words printed on my latte for free. I've only gone when they weren't too busy and I've had great experiences. Great spot to stop on a bach trip or a girls weekend!
__label__5	"There is no better coffee.

I feel the need to elaborate, but I can't find any better or more descriptive words. So I will leave it at that - if you are looking for great coffee, this is your place."
__label__5	Some of the best service i've received. Owner is super nice and food speaks for itself. Coffee is phenomenal as well. Definitely a must have when in Nashville.
__label__5	"Love this place!  They have great sales and I most generally get the freshest of fruits and veggies here.  The checkers are fun and sometimes dancing!  Whoop  Whoop!  
I give 5 stars for a great place to shop."
__label__5	"Summerland - What an adorable stretch along Hwy 101, with some quaint antique shops and other boutique shops. I will always visit Summerland if I'm on this highway again! The drive heading south from here is just beautiful.

The traffic was slow through Santa Barbara, so it was a great idea to take a break for a quick wine tasting at Summerland Winery. I am now a more educated wine drinker because of them! I particularly liked their Sauvignon Blanc and their chardonnay is the best one I've had. The service was friendly, and so were members who stopped in."
__label__5	Great food,  great service,  and really cute setting. Nice place for brunch if you're in the area!
__label__5	"I can confidently tell you that Ginger Beard makes the BEST cold brew nitro in Tampa. I've even gotten into the habit of buying a growler for the week! I also have tried cold brew nitro from many other coffee places in Tampa, and none even hold a candle to these guys. Also, the gentlemen that run Ginger Beard are two of the nicest small business owners we've met!
Cannot recommend this place enough."
__label__5	The cutest little greenhouse! Such a great variety of all types of plants... Cacti, indoor plants, outdoor plants, flowerbed items. You name it they have it! Their flower/plant pot selection is also beautiful and reasonably priced!
__label__5	"This is my all time favorite restaurant. If you are looking for something upscale and fancy, this is not your place (and New Orleans then probably isn't either)
But, if you want a cozy brunch in a small cute place, check it out. 
Most people get the avocado toast, but I highly recommend the cheese and herb crepe with an added egg. Definitely split the abelskivers (I recommend getting them with chocolate sauce, Nutella and caramel)
One thing I wish was a bit better is the iced coffee, but it is still good!"
__label__5	After much trial and error, this is now my most favorite spot in the city to hang out and get work done. Amazing staff, amazing lattes and so so many drink options! In addition to coffees and lattes, Italian cream sodas are also on the menu. My recommendations are the horchata latte and the mango sunburst cream soda.
__label__5	"""Don't judge a book by its cover"" is really fit.
All the food are delicious with very reasonable price. Thd noodle.is homemade, soft and taste good. Love theit tea eggs and pog ears.
Since the place is small, sometime you need to wait, but wont be long and also the food also come in very reasonable time."
__label__5	Loved it!!! Great service and was able to split a meal without any hassle! Was gluten free friendly!
__label__5	Visited this location while in town for a concert. We were seated quickly and service was prompt. I ordered the bistro chicken. It was tender and with nice portions thinly sliced. My fiancé had the ribeye steak and was pleased. We would visit again.
__label__5	I took a shot of ordering from here for my grandmother and I will 100% be ordering again. I got her a cheeesy burger with some extras and it was so crispy, juicy, cheesy and flavorful! I took a bite and regretted not getting myself one. The tots kinda had a weird taste but I'm sure it wasn't anything crazy, the burger made up for it 100%.
__label__5	This is our go-to spot for a burger and a couple beers on Friday nights. They always have a great seasonal beer selection, so I almost always try something new. As far as food, I almost always get the same thing: the chipotle guacamole turkey burger. My boyfriend's favorite is the Eiffel burger.  The servers are always friendly and we love sitting at the high tops. We have been here a hundred times, and will definitely be back (many times).
__label__5	"We go to The Shack at least 2 or 3 times a month and always enjoy the experience. 
Great food, great service and great fun."
__label__5	I've eaten here sparingly, but I LOVE their milkshakes! There is not a flavor I don't like. They use fresh fruit in the fruit shakes and will mix flavors for a little extra. However, I hate that they close at nine no matter what time of the year. That makes it hard in the summer when craving them around eleven!
__label__5	This place is fantastic. The people go the extra mile, the rooms are spacious, the smoothies in the morning are delicious, and the pool is refreshing. I love the small, intimate feeling of this hotel and would definitely recommend it.
__label__5	If you are visiting Philadelphia or are a long-time resident in the mood for some amazing food, you need to check out El Merkury. El Merkury has great cuisine and you can't beat the price point. If you have a sweet tooth, the churros are a MUST HAVE. The service was quick and the restaurant is in pristine condition. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
__label__5	"This little restaurant was great! Attentive, quick, and pleasant service, and the food was delicious. I had the scallops, which were so good. It was about five Sea scallops with asparagus tips and scallions. My date had shrimp red curry and he said it was also very good. The desserts were awesome; we had hazelnut gelato (one scoop - perfect amount for right after a meal) and the poached pear. 
I would definitely go back here."
__label__5	I will be dreaming about their strawberry shortcake and pecan pie for the rest of my life. This place will exceed your expectations.
__label__5	Make reservations!! This place is a must and every option is a good option. Sunday brunch is lively with yummy food coming out of the kitchen. Loved the layout - it's in a converted small house so there are small rooms for intimate dining and great art everywhere. It's a fun place! Go hungry.
__label__5	Instant love over here. In Indianapolis for CROSS Conference 2016 at the Indiana Convention Centre nearby and I am so happy that this (among other food options) is nearby to grab meals during session and workshop breaks.  Steak N' Shake has the vintage diner feel with an incredible $4 everything menu (with only $.25 upgrade for fries) famous for steakburgers and milkshakes which both lived excellently to its name. Delicious and totally hit the spot. Also, a plus that it's 24 hours :)
__label__5	COVID-19 update: they now offer outdoor dining!!!  They have 4 tables for 2 in the front. They have the best creamed chip beef omelette!!! See my original review for more details. Love this restaurant!!!
__label__5	The BEST bagels in NL and Fishtown, hands down. Nicest owners, their whitefish salad is on point too. Actually, everything we have ever had from here has been excellent. This is the kind of neighborhood establishment we need to support!
__label__5	Locally owned and operated, this place is the bee's knees bro. You want some wings they got you , salad ? Helllll yes brutha  Pizza and Calzones will give you a mouth orgasm. Then to finish it off snag or freshly made cannoli or cheeses cake this place is my favorite pizza joint in Tucson
__label__5	We decided to order from The Grove location before 5pm to avoid the dinner rush and it paid off! The wait time was 45-60 minute but it arrived in 30 minutes. The contactless delivery was easy and the driver seemed to linger by their car to make sure I came out. It was delicious and we would definitely order again! I'm already eyeing a shawarma!
__label__5	Miles was very helpful, and kind. Price was good, and he fixed my screen in an hour. Thanks!
__label__5	A couple of guys and I went to lunch today.  We all got korritos.  Food was amazing!  Staff was friendly.  We all said we'd come back.  The only downside is the parking situation...check them out!!!
__label__5	Got a screw in my tire and they patched it up so fast! I was in and out within 30 min. And I was thrilled on how inexpensive it was!
__label__5	"oh the good fun here!!!

awesome piano man downstairs crooning the latest from moulin rouge to billy joel and anything else to get you swaying by the bar. the bartenders are fantastic and fab, taking care of ladies and gents with friendly neighborly extra pours and fun times. free coat check and no cover.

head upstairs when you are ready to dance your pants off!!! britney, electro-house, hip hop and everything inbetween! reasonable drinks and a great time always!"
__label__5	Excellent food. Very large portions. Bourbon hamburger. Also they will split a float into two glasses which is filling for any adult.
__label__5	Amazing sandwiches. Great service. Friendly faces. One of the best lunch places downtown. If you want a quick, tasty meal, that will not be a disappointment then come to Pickles and Swiss.
__label__5	All around fan-flipping-tastic. Came here for the first time with some friends that are locals (and therefore regulars of this great little spot) and the owner recognized and greeted them with a warm smile. Oh yeah, and the crepes are WONDERFUL.
__label__5	I lived in Conshohocken for  more than a year before I finally stopped in on my way home from work one day.  Amazing selection and great prices. I was even able to get treats for my dog, so thats a plus!  I can't wait to come back to get some fresh made nut butter!!  WARNING: you may become addicted.
__label__5	Just after landing in the New Orleans area, I had a hankering to try some gumbo. Since I was in Metairie, I decided to try Chef Ron's Gumbo Stop. I had the seafood gumbo which was all rich, flavorful goodness. Then for dessert I had the awesome Bread Pudding. It was also a nice touch to meet Chef Ron, and have him make sure my meal was ok. The gumbo stop gets a big thumbs up!
__label__5	Delicious food, especially the Po'boys. Fun place to eat and watch football. The line can get long during peak time but typically moves quickly.
__label__5	Love this store! My husband usually does the shopping here, but stopped in with my young son (and puppy) today to pick up some dog food. AWESOME customer service- super polite and friendly! The guy who helped me (didn't catch his name) also carried my dog food out and loaded it in my trunk for me- not necessary, but a really nice touch! Love the huge selection of dog treats/snacks, and I see they offer things like snake training as well. Really great place, and love supporting a small local business rather than the chain pet stores. We will be back!
__label__5	The chargrilled oysters are the bomb, service is great !!! I guess that's why we keep driving 300 miles for these damn oysters !!! They are so addictive. A must try...
__label__5	Gave Barrys a try the other night after hearing they had good steaks. I was not disappointed. Cheese steak was nice and thick. Steak fries were on point. Not greasy at all. We will definitely start making this one of our regular spots.
__label__5	Fun atmosphere all year round, especially in the summer, plenty of outside seating and the drinks are awesome, the Endless Summer Margarita is my go to, followed by the Chicken Enchiladas. They also start you off with chips and salsas, red and green both are very good. Service is quick, depending on the day/night there could be a wait, but for me it's worth it.
__label__5	ROCK STARS! Needed a replacement laptop. Yes, thrashed the other one! They not only sold me a CHEAP HP, that has every bell and whistle on it, but was CHEAP! Did I mention how CHEAP IT WAS? $109 AWESOME! I am completely happy with the little laptop I got. And it has everything on it! These guys just keep making me very happy!
__label__5	I went there tonight with my friend and enjoyed a delicious meal. The restaurant was clean, the service was friendly, the food was delicious, and the prices were reasonable. I am not exactly sure why this diner only has three stars, but I am giving them five tonight.
__label__5	Great people, Great Southern Food with Northern Flare... Price is Right! Seafood and Short Rib Platters are my Favorite..  Banana Pudding a #MUST
__label__5	Love this place! Anything you get will be good. Grandma in the back whipping everything up just right! This is one of my go to's for sure!
__label__5	This place was great! Dash, our server was funny, attentive & spot on with suggestions. The Debris fries were amazing, as was the red beans & rice. The family is currently arguing about the gumbo...I loved it, they thought it was ok. The menu is impressive & we'll be back to try other items.
__label__5	Was always great. Unfortunately, they closed yesterday. They were bought by another bbq company.
__label__5	Love this place! Food is amazing and you get a ton for what you pay. Good service and it's a cute little place. Their pita bread is some of the best. My last visit we were given a different bread that tasted like something out of a bag. I hope it was just a bad day and not something they've switched to permanently.
__label__5	Great totally awesome food!.. Authentic...everything is fresh and made to order. Never disappointed when I come here. Great prices. Very small place next to corner store where you can buy a beer to go with your yummy food. They do close kinda early, like around 6. They sometimes have $1 taco special!.. Yummers
__label__5	Wow! What a great park..I have lived in Nashville (downtown) for 2 years and this was my first visit to the park.  The park was a wonderful surprise and I will visit often. Clean, beautiful, sense of safety.....nice walking paths, dog area, golf, baseball fields, tennis courts, and pond. A gem in the city...a must for anyone living in Nashville!
__label__5	"I am happy to say that I am reversing my first review of this place 
I've been back several times and the Service has been excellent and the food has always been excellent"
__label__5	"I love the staff at Broomall Total Health Center.  They are friendly and accommodating.  I can always get an appointment even with my busy work schedule.  Dr. Belitsky is always helpful and has improved my life tremendously.

Newtown Square,"
__label__5	Third time I've have been here while traveling in Nashville. I love that they are open so late for dinner. The offerings are great and I haven't tried anything that haven't loved. Tonight it was the chicken salad and soup. Excellent choice for a lighter delicious meal. I will always stop when in town.
__label__5	I just had the Sharp Italian Primo Hoagie.  EXCELLENT!!  Spicy, fresh ingredients, delicious roll.  The place is clean as can be and the staff are efficient.   I will definitely be back for more!   If you don't know the area, it's in the Paoli Village Shoppes near the train station.  Go there!
__label__5	My husband and I both had delicious breakfast here: a healthy egg whites and grilled turkey with avocado plate for me and huevos rancheros for him. Quick service and friendly staff. Highly recommend if you're in this neighborhood.
__label__5	ATE GOOOOOD, We will be back!! We went when they were having the buffet and I usually don't like buffet style.  However it was good.
__label__5	Delicious lunch! We really enjoy the burgers, salmon & crab cakes & fries!! It never disappoints!
__label__5	Great local business! The food is always comforting and we end up eating way too much. You know the food is good when Filipino families are eating there. My parents drive over an hour to eat here when they don't feel like cooking - it is that good. Filipino foodies, this place is a MUST! And if you're tired of eating the bland local fare (yawn pizza, burgers, subs) then stop by here. The adobo is just like Lola's home cooking.

__label__5	We loved Grace.  The atmosphere was great, the staff is very friendly and helpful with recommendations.  We learned that the drinks are named after local dogs in the neighborhood and we loved the personalized touch.  It is very clean inside and looks brand new.  We found that it is well taken care of and in much better shape than may of the other, older establishments.  The lamb meatballs are very good.  Would recommend to others.
__label__5	Wonderful local place for breakfast or lunch. May be a wait for a table during peak times, but don't let the line scare you off because tables open up pretty quickly. DO let the pancakes scare you - very tasty but a big serving, so you might go with the short stack unless you are very hungry :)
__label__5	Definitely worth the drive, wait and price. I am so glad I go to South Tampa every Saturday now.
__label__5	"I went into best buy today to purchase a basic laptop computer.  Becky, who specializes in HP computers was MORE than helpful and knowledgeable. She was SO nice & helpful. She answered all of my questions And taught me a few things as well. I'll definatly be back. 
Thanks, Becky!"
__label__5	Got my oil changed by Demetrius and Russel this morning. They was super friendly and efficient and informed me of what was going on in my air filter as well as my engine filter (two things I knew nothing about). They didn't push me to purchase anything I wasn't comfortable with, which I really appreciated. Highly recommend!
__label__5	My wife and I stopped here after the Holiday Bazaar and it was worth the freezing cold weather! Man these guys can cook!! The guy was really friendly and helped me pick out what their best sellers are and what we would like. I went with the butter chicken and my wife went with the spice box. Both were filled with high quality meat and had complex flavoring. The boxes are great for walking and eating and the portions are perfect. I can't wait to spot this truck again for seconds!
__label__5	This gal is awesome! Well established shop, stellar reputation. Love the beach yoga classes she does.
__label__5	Today they only have creme soups! I would rather they have a few more broth based soups! But the chowder was good and so was the bread
__label__5	Great salad and soup selections, fresh, and always enjoyable and feel healthy eating here.
__label__5	My husband and I went there for lunch on a whim. YAY! We sat outside by the fountain and enjoyed the birds dancing in and out of the water while our waiter made us fresh table-side guacamole. Our entrees were OUT-OF-THIS-WORLD! I was sad we forgot our free churros they gave us to take home. But seriously thrilled they gave us 'worry dolls' and told us of the tradition. I can't wait to go back!
__label__5	"Beyond description. 
First time there. 
I've always been leery about Thai food. I only went once before and burned my mouth, way too spicy for me. 
I went with a small group celebrating a birthday. 
Everything that came out of the kitchen was just great, no exceptions. 
Soup came with the dinner and that was the first inkling that this place was different, just excellent. 
Prices were very reasonable, good parking lot too."
__label__5	Five stars is not enough. Ryan and team are incredible. The food and the service are unmatched, and it's so great to have a place like Market on Ninth in our neighborhood.
__label__5	"Was looking for a new place to try. Searched ""places to eat near hotel"", came across this spot. Arrived and was seated quickly. Ordered the Pasta Alfredeaux and the shrimp/catfish plate with jambalaya. Food came fast and DAMN IT WAS GOOD! The pasta had a little zip to it, yet it was the perfect amount of spice.  The catfish/shrimp plate was great, seasoned perfectly! The jambalaya was very flavorful! No complaints, friendly service."
__label__5	pre-covid, i visited salt and smoke and had a great experience but forgot to review it! the food was nice and employees were friendly and the atmosphere was really pleasant.
__label__5	Came for the flaming cheese dish and it did not disappoint!  So good!  I also had a Gyro and loved it also. Came with these potato wedges and sauce that I really liked.  I'm coming back for a late night meal to see the belly dancer soon!
__label__5	This place reminds me of Xoom Juice on Speedway and Wilmot, only with a better menu and cheaper prices. The customer service here is great! There was only one person on staff here during my visit, but she was able to help me find the perfect smoothie for me. I will definitely plan on coming here in the future.
__label__5	"It's been so long since I've eaten anything this delicious. 

The platter of veggies that starts you off, all the small plates afterwards, DESSERT!  

Everything is just so delightful and I can't wait to come back and eat more food here over and over and over again."
__label__5	Came here for a great pizza steak again today.  Despite other reviews, TLs has fenced parking next door on Oregon Ave., adjacent to restaurant.  Headed westbound on Ore Ave,, turn right into lot just after I95 underpass.  Headed eastbound, one can turn left into parking unless 18-wheelers are turning left onto Front, blocking your turn.
__label__5	Excellent establishment with wonderful service. Chris, our bartender was phenomenal. He was attentive and had great customer service. Chris truly made our experience great! Anytime I return, I will definitely request Chris. Thank you Chris for making our experience great!!
__label__5	The lobster omelette was absolutely delicious. The waffle was wonderful. We really enjoyed the atmosphere and our waitress (I think Rebecca ‍) was very nice and helpful. We highly recommend this restaurant.
__label__5	The calzone was amazing!!!! It was huge!!!  The cheesy bread was great as well!  For the price it was so much food!!
__label__5	The food here is delicious and very close to home made!  The server was excellent and very helpful!  This has become one of our favorite restaurants in Tucson and we have many!!  Every dish we ordered was delicious, hot and yummy, yummy, yummy!
__label__5	Saw the vet here. She gave us the Vetco flea stuff and it is WORKING where all the others failed, apparently because of having developed an immunity to the stuff (Advantage, etc.) SO grateful and look forward to the new vet services they are currently working on. The vet herself was great.
__label__5	Place is great and the prices keep the riff raff out. I'll gladly pay for quality food and good service
__label__5	My wife and I went to NaBrasa to celebrate. The salad bar was extravagant.  It contained not only salads, but also ribs and other entrees.  The gauchos kept our plates brimming with delicious assorted meats. Excellent service! Our waiter was funny and very entertaining to speak with.  We left stuffed and happy. Needless to say, we plan on going again soon!
__label__5	Most pleasant experience ever at a nail salon!  Becky did my pedi & her daughter did my husband's. They were delightful & did an immaculate job. Definitely the cleanest nail salon I've ever seen & quiet, relaxing music playing.  Found it by accident & we're so pleasantly surprised.   Will go back again if we're in town & will recommend to anyone going to Franklin, Brentwood or Nashville.
__label__5	"Just excellent. I had been hearing that for quite some time and finally made it there last night. We were seated in moments at a great corner table. Our server (David) told us about his favorites so descriptively I could taste the words coming out of his mouth. It was all excellent. We all live here and are all in the restaurant biz. We all just loved the food and David.
5 stars just aint enough baby.
LOVED DAT."
__label__5	By far the best street food I have encountered in Boise!!!  Be sure to explore their menu!
__label__5	"Mmmmmmmm! I came here last night for the first time and got the cheese plate w/ local honey as an app and the steak tartare as my plate. It was all so fresh and good. This was my first time having tartare and I'm so glad I got it here!  My cocktail was awesome as well, and they have a great happy hour menu. $3 for beers and $6 for cocktails. 

Another thing I loved was the service. They were so on top of refilling water and everyone was very friendly. I loved my experience here!"
__label__5	Excellent late night Mexican. Bean dip with chips?!  Fantastic. Taco packs in a variety of selections?!  Yes. Beer? That too. Eat here often.
__label__5	I don't buy my dog food here, but they always have a fun selection of frozen specialty treats that my dogs love.  The leashes are pricey, but they last forever (you will seriously just get tired of it before it rips or frays) .  Five stars!
__label__5	Love this place ! I always go there for my lunch break the staff there is so nice. They know my order. Lol . I really recommend going there for the pokè bowls they are out of this world! They have an interesting takes on sushi. I would go if you want sushi with a twist. They are really clean and really fast.
__label__5	This place is so much fun! My friends and I went on a Friday and didn't make a reservation but was able to go in. We went to the mojo room, and although we didn't win we had a great time! Adrianne was cool and hilarious when we were doing our challenge lol. This is great if you're looking for something different to do and want to get that critical thinking going
__label__5	There was confusion on scheduling a weekend appointment for our AC not working and Tracy helped us get a technician. She went above and beyond making sure that we got a scheduled appointment.
__label__5	"Loved Little Tuna. Was here last night and the food was excellent. Everything was cooked perfectly. The scallops wrapped in bacon were the best Ive ever had.  Its a BYO but there is also a short wine list, in case you forget! 

Will definitely be making a trip back to Haddonfield to visit again."
__label__5	Dr. Pedrick and her team are EXCELLENT! Between the service and the most updated equipment, select Dr. Pedrick if you haven't done so - yet!
__label__5	My favorite lunch spot in Ybor. Best greek salad of all time. Great service.
__label__5	SO NICE AND RESPECTFUL! Seriously astonished by the level of customer service provided to me today. I had a nail in my tire, and they fixed it for FREE. That alone is amazing, but they also never tried to tell me I needed to buy new tires. Definitely will be purchasing my next set of tires there! 10/10 would recommend.
__label__5	Very flavorful and fresh!  And we chose some of the spicier dishes and they were fantastic. We can't wait to go back!
__label__5	Came here, ate some dogs, chatted with the waiter and attempted to beat the record on the arcade until I realized the high score wasn't 20 000 but 200 000. I drenched my sadness in dogs. It was amazing. Love the combinations and the flavors they come up with!
__label__5	Their Ponchatoula King Cake is to die for! I've come across many King cakes made by different bakery and most of them are too sweet! Maurice makes their king cake very balanced. Flavorful, fresh, soft and a perfect amount of sweetness. My family loved the king cake and they aren't a fan of sweet either!! Thank-you Maurice French Pastries are your services!
__label__5	Excellent food and they give you a great amount for an inexpensive price. Never had a cheesesteak on a kaiser roll but it was fantastic
__label__5	Ive never left a five star review, mostly because I've never felt so strongly about leaving a business positive feedback until I met Janet. I got a bikini wax for my wedding today and she did such an outstanding job. She was pleasant, professional and competent. If you're not sure where to go, look no further. Janet is amazing!!!
__label__5	This was my first time there and this place is awesome. The waitress was extremely friendly and helpful with the menu. It's not big place but the decor is very cool. The risotto balls are a good appetizer to get especially with the sharp cheese in them. Loved the meatloaf taste like it was made at home. Definitely going to make this place a regular spot.
__label__5	I thoroughly enjoyed the scallops here and the atmosphere was very trendy and fun. My husband and I just sat at the bar for a quick drink and entree but was seated very quickly and food came out quickly and amazing.
__label__5	Place was amazing we went here on consecutive days because we want to try the rest of the menu. Good food good drinks and great staff, expecially Ruth
__label__5	Wonderful staff and food was tasty and very comforting. I loved that the cook came out to greet us. I ordered the cabbage rolls and my wifey ordered the vegetarian Sataras, which she loved. It came with their own Bosnian bread. We also had the half and half appetizer--half veggie puree and have tzatiki cream. So good. We will be eating here again.
__label__5	Happy to report they are open on Saturdays again! Besides brewing exceptional coffee and tea, they offer inviting, comfortable seating in spacious, attractive space inside and on their shaded patio. Classical music calms and inspires. This place is a gem. So grateful I can walk to it.
__label__5	"Went around the entire city looking for ""Ronnie's sunflower seeds"" As there is an extreme shortage right now and everyone is wanting them for camping season. After checking about 10 stores decided to call Cabela's before driving all the way up there. Spoke with Amanda, was very helpful and grabbed handfuls and put them on hold for us so they wouldn't sell out by the time we drove there."
__label__5	"Excellent wings. They are broiled to perfection and not deep fried. Get the hot and super hot sauce on the side. Neither are very hot but both are very flavorful. Order a Bloody Mary as a compliment, spicy. 

The service is amazing, with attention to detail. Constant check-in's but not annoying. They will put your favorite team on if you ask. Go Seahawks!"
__label__5	The fried chicken is the star - but we also enjoyed all of the sides we tried (Mac & cheese especially). We came on a busy Saturday evening but were able to be seated quickly outside.
__label__5	"""One wiz without"". Line seemed long, but it moved really fast! Have  your money and order ready when you arrive at the window. Great cheesesteak. My stomach enjoyed every bite! Hopefully willl visit again."
__label__5	"I came in a group. Personal preference.

Favorite:
Arroz negro

Amazing : 
avocado salad, asparagus elotes, tuna a la plancha, 

Above average:
Tuna tostada

Forgot/okay:
Drum escabeche, tostones"
__label__5	"I've used Yellow Cab for over 25 years. 
They are friendly, reliable, and trustworthy.
They are the only company who arrives as scheduled to make it on time for a flight. The other taxi companies flake out! 
I will continue to use and recommend this locally owned and operated business!"
__label__5	Our breakfast was excellent. I had the Santorino omelette and my wife had the special. The place was very clean and the service was excellent. We had two kids and they were very accommodating. Highly recommend.
__label__5	This is my favorite spot since moving to st Pete. Conveniently located right next to my favorite coffee spot, the GRIND. The food is to die for the serves is always friendly and kind. Great for large group hang outs or just grabbing a quick bite. TRY THE GROUPER!!!
__label__5	This is some of the best pizza in philly. They have a great selection of food and I always enjoy whatever I order. I would highly recommend this place.
__label__5	Mark really knows his stuff.  He gave me some great advice about my disregarded entity, LLC.  I am glad to have a competent professional to whom I can refer to for tax and accounting advice.
__label__5	Read these reviews so gave it a try. Having trouble installing a new HP printer. Told Mike what the issue was and he told me 2 things:  1) I'm not crazy! The install should have worked just fine & 2) Return it to the store! There's something WRONG with it. He's not a fan of HP and suggested I try another brand. Mike could not have been nicer!! Any and all computer issues, repairs, etc. and this family is heading directly to Mike!
__label__5	This place was amazing! I had kale salad, a mixed drink called Namaste. It had fresh carrot juice in it w/ vodka & ginger I think. Will definitely be returning!
__label__5	The Mecca of Steakhouses.  The steaks are to die for, but the experience, is second to none.  You get multiple courses and can get out of here with spending less than $50 a person.  They have the largest wine cellar in the US and a dessert room that is stunning.  Try their Macadamia Nut Ice Cream and you will have to come back again.  Easily one of my favorite restaurants, I am lucky to live only an hour away from it.
__label__5	I'm leaving for Florida next week, and my a/c wasn't working.  My appointment was for 8am, and by 845 Keith came in the waiting room, and thoroughly explained everything.  Turns out it was just out of freon.  All fluids were checked, as well as tire pressure.  I'm VERY pleased with the service here!  I wish I would've known about Northeast Auto years ago!  I would highly recommend this business!
__label__5	Wonderful Indian food in the Bella Vista area. They opened in the midst of the COVID pandemic, so we definitely wanted to try them out and support a new local business. We ordered the lamb vindaloo, chicken makhani, and the vegetable samosas. Everything was fantastic, the vindaloo had a nice warm spiciness to it and the makhani tomato butter sauce was creamy and delicious. We will definitely be going back to try more!
__label__5	I've been to a few rolled ice cream places and this one is very unique! They have great selections and the decor is very cute. I had the coffee/ pirouette rolled ice cream and it couldn't have tasted any better. Highly recommend this place especially on a hot day. The employees are absolutely wonderful!
__label__5	If I could give 100 stars, I would.  The customer service is nothing short of spectacular!  I had my glasses stolen after only one week.  They were super helpful in getting them replaced for me.  I would never buy my glasses anywhere else.  Love the styles and the customer service is just WOW!
__label__5	I've been coming to Heather for over a year now and she never disappoints me. She is so incredibly talented and sweet! I've brought multiple family members to come see her when they are in town and love purchasing her gift cards as a gift for friends too! I am amazed by how gorgeous her nail art work is - it's taken me a while to be comfortable doing something other than pink-square nails and this was EXACTLY what I was hoping for. I can't wait to come back in 3 weeks to see what other amazing art work she creates for me!
__label__5	So very good. Worth all the 5 star reviews they have received. Servers are also very pleasant. This was the best food we ate during our trip to Tucson.
__label__5	10/10 I highly recommend! I enjoyed my experience here! Not only is there an immense variety of flavors, including sorbets, sugar free, and low fat flavors! The toppings are always fresh and refilled! I love the customer service I received! The staff was helpful and polite, creating a friendly and exciting environment! I will definitely be back! Bonus points for the cleanliness of the shop!!
__label__5	"Literally the best Puerto Rican food in Florida. Hands down!
I stop by every time I'm in Tampa and they never disappoint. 
Want to not be disappointed with you Hispanic cravings, this spots where it's at."
__label__5	This place was so cute and so good! Cheese grits were AMAZING! I'm glad we got there when we did because it got busy fast and the line was out the door. All staff was super friendly and service was fast!
__label__5	Delish!  My mom and I live in the area, but hadn't checked out this local gem. So glad we did!  We had the Tuesday evening buffet - so good!  My favorite was the chicken tikka masala, but the sag paneer was also quite good.  The manager was very welcoming and funny.  I highly recommend this place and cannot wait to go again!
__label__5	the spare ribs and brisket sandwich were delicious! The staff was very friendly and we sat on outdoor patio with our dog. We enjoyed this stop!
__label__5	If you are looking for authentic Mexican food look no further! I had the tacos and my husband had the burrito for dinner this evening and it was delicious. The owner, Rita, was super friendly too. I've been looking for authentic Mexican food since I moved to Indy and so glad I finally found it!
__label__5	The food I am not sure. I am looking forward to go back! But the beer is amazing!!!! - the vibe of the place is very casual, excellent place to go and watch sports too!! There are plenty of screens around the restaurant/ bar and it's easy to see any of them from anywhere.
__label__5	Loved this place, stopped in on the way home from Wesley Chapel. Had ginger salad, it's got a little spicy pepper kick to it, very tasty! We had a California roll, which was fresh and tummy!! Shrimp tempura and veggies had the perfect amount of batted. Tempura had broccoli, sweet potatoes, onions, zucchini!
__label__5	Let me start by saying Thank you to the chefs because I never my life thought I would eat what I'm eating and actually enjoy it. I've been doing the paleo option and I love it!!!! It taste amazing and you can taste the freshness. I will be staying with them for a long time :)
__label__5	New restaurant first time visiting. I had the chicken salteado. Was delicious quality ingredients. Staff was very friendly service was excellent. Very happy to have found this new location
__label__5	Annoyed that it took me three months to try this wonderful place. Great renovation of the space and the food is amazing. Just the right amount of flavor and space in the dishes I tried.
__label__5	Visiting Philly for the A-10 baseball tournament....found this amazing restaurant with the help of Yelp.  Everyone in our party loved their meal! My husband said he would come back to this area just to go to Spasso!
__label__5	I first visited a vampire penguin when I lived in California and I'm so excited to see one opened up here in this area. This particular franchise is very good and the people working there were extremely friendly. The shaved snow was light and fluffy and tasted wonderful!
__label__5	Best vintage store! They have a fantastic selection of vintage styles. Tops. Pants. Coats. Dresses. It's 2.5 rooms of pure treasure. I bought 10 pieces. And I'm not the only one who loves this place because store was packed with shoppers. To make it even better, there is a cigar bar right across the street so my husband was thrilled when I dropped him off while I shopped Funky Monkey for a couple of hours.
__label__5	Very good cookies, even better bagels. Really friendly service and a good place to grab a quick bite.
__label__5	Great food, great service. I ate here for lunch the other day with a coworker. The lunch specials are pretty affordable. I had Drunken Noodle. It was AMAZING! I definitely recommend eating here.
__label__5	This place is great! I've been to 4 other pho places in the Nashville area and this place may be the best. The sushi is also really good. I go here all the time now.
__label__5	If you're willing to drive through a rougher neighborhood for some Cuban, this is your place!!! The food is so amazing! I got oxtail and to those of you not used to having this, you're missing out. It was cooked perfectly. The meat was so tender and juicy and the sauce was perfect. I also got a strawberry smoothie. The ultimate comfort food.
__label__5	Omg!  This place is my new go to for seafood!  My boyfriend brought some home, so I haven't actually been to the establishment.  Had the loaded crab legs w/shrimp.  I was surprised at the size of the crab legs.  I expected tiny Chinese buffet sizes, but they were actually quite a bit bigger with a good amount of meat.  And the Buttah Sauce...yumm!!!  Stopping by to grab lunch again soon and can't wait to try something different and spicy.
__label__5	"Great coffee shop in Reno. A welcome alternative to SBUX. Not that SBUX is bad, they did allow great coffees to be brought to the masses, even to little towns like Reno.

Get the 'White Coffee'! It's amazing! It taste like a nutty tea, yet has a bigger caffeine kick than regular espresso! The clerk told me that they have the exclusive right to this type of coffee so looks like they are my new favorite coffee shop."
__label__5	Great customer service from our amazing hostess, Holly, and happy server, Paige. Love the sushi, the setting, andnthe service. And the company. :-)
__label__5	Stayed at The Roosevelt for my significant other's birthday. I expressed prior to my arrival the need for privacy because we would have guests coming to meet us for the celebration. They upgraded us to a corner room on a floor with few guests. They also left him a birthday surprise and gave us comp bar tickets. I booked this room using my military affiliation and it is shameful how awesome my rate was. The staff is professional and helpful. I will definitely be back!
__label__5	If you are on the fence go ahead and jump over.  I have never learned so much valuable information in one session before (and I've been to several different seminars and investment group mtgs).  The owner is professional, extremely knowledgeable and as transparent as they come.  In other words there are no gimmicks.  I'm so glad I decided to request a 1:1 call.  I also attended the investment event which opened my eyes to opportunities I didn't even know existed.  Rosebud Investments is amazing.
__label__5	If you are looking for a friendly, professional, and efficient local mover, you should definitely reach out to Swift Moves!  I reached out to Swift Moves via Yelp. Jeremy responded to my inquiry in less than 15 minutes via email. We were able to quickly pinpoint a date and time for our move. He called 24 hours in advance to confirm our appointment. Additionally, he showed up on time and immediately got started! It took them a little less than the time he originally anticipated, and all of our belongings arrived in perfect condition.
__label__5	We were here on vacation from the East coast 3 years ago and discovered them on Yelp on our first day. We went back several other times because the coffee drinks and breakfast burritos were so good. We still crave them after all this time. Don't miss it!
__label__5	"Food was excellent, service was very happy and helpful.

I got a Mega Lobster Roll and A Spicy Girl roll. Both were fantastic and we look forward to coming back again!"
__label__5	Going back home is always fun for me! My grandma and I always come here every time I come home. First of all, it is so hard to find good chicken wings or buffalo chicken wraps and this location never lets me down. The food is always fresh and well prepped. The service is always great as well. I would recommend this location for lunch or dinner. You will get great service and your food will be super fresh!
__label__5	Hi - My AC stopped working overnight.  When I called Hot 2 Cold at 7 am, I spoke to a very professional associate (not a machine!) who wasted no time in setting up a quick appointment.  I got another call from the office to let me know the truck was in route. The serviceman (John) arrived on time and went straight to work.  He resolved my problem almost immediately.  He gave me some useful tips for avoiding future problems and the price was reasonable.  I will definitely call Hot 2 Cold for AC work in the future, am completely satisfied.
__label__5	So glad I tried this restaurant! It's a must try and is officially one of my favorite restaurants! I ordered the Half Moon Fish Taco with spaghetti squash! Amazing! I'm already craving this dish. I can't wait to try other items. I also had the white sangria which I thought was smaller than most places. I'll be back!
__label__5	The Carnivore pizza, followed by the Tiramisu, was perhaps the most divine meal on the planet.
__label__5	Brandon may be the best bartender I have ever see under crushing pressure. We return here often to experience the service and attitude this young man exhibits. Dave and Paula.
__label__5	"The dance floor has a sign on it that states ""Dance At Your Own Risk""  and there recently was a painting on the wall of the ""F-Bomb"".

Chrissy makes the best My Little Pony shots.

Last week I walked in and some woman I never met in my life screamed ""Oh My God, where have you been?!"" and walked over and gave me a huge hug and then serenaded me all night singing Sinatra.

Dogs (the kind with tails) are welcome here also.

This place is sheer Perfection.

I hope it never changes."
__label__5	I have dined here several times and have never had a bad nor marginal experience.  Frankly  I don't understand the Yelp rating of 3 1/2 stars.  Price and quality are great values and if you're an oenophile, the wine list is beyond reasonable and would embarrass Vegas' overblown, overpriced and pretentious wine lists!   Don't judge this book by its cover!
__label__5	"I dine here through takeout at least once a month. Just dropped here to say ""thanks"" for an orderly take out process, an order that is always right, and consistent food. 

Thank you!"
__label__5	Such a beautiful place. Great cheese and charcuterie board and the Barney shrubble is my new favorite cocktail in town! Will be back! Thank you!
__label__5	I am a NOLA newbie.  Very much enjoyed the food and conversation and the sole fact that delicious vegan food was offered, and it was way more than salad or toast.  I had the vegan gumbo.  It was very tasty and a vegan cookie, (browned butter caramel, yummmmm). There must have been at least 5 or so vegan offerings.  Thanks for being enlightened.
__label__5	Popped in because it was in walking distance from our vacation home and it looked interesting. Great waterway views, friendly staff and great food. Casual atmosphere and family friendly. Had the Mojo Roast Pork, delicious!!!! Wife had the seafood platter and of course had to get a box. Price is right too!! Fed family of four with drinks and a tip $70.00. Great place for seafood or land lubbers fare or just to stop in and have a sit at the bar.
__label__5	Haven't been to a Zoup in years. But I'm so happy I decided to give it a try again. They were super nice and fun and made me feel so welcomed.  Will definitely go back!
__label__5	Best place to get what ever u want, you don't need any other store besides this place, food, groceries, did I say food !!!
__label__5	Tranzilli's is a northwest Philly classic water ice establishment.  It is located in East Germantown on a street you prob won't be riding down unless you want to taste this delicious concoction. Fortunately there is ample street parking.  This is one of the best water ices in Philly.  It has a great texture and comes in a variety of flavors.  They also sell Philly cheese pretzels here so this is a true Philadelphia destination.  So if you think all Philly water ices are the same, they are not.  Try Tranzilli's for one!
__label__5	My favorite deli sandwich store. They are the each and every time. It doesn't matter which one I go to. Everything is sooo fresh and always something new going on.
__label__5	They have the best Beer Can Chicken! My husband had the ribs and they were awesome. It was a great experience. Our server was very friendly and excellent service.
__label__5	One of the best places to get a quick bite in Delco. Bruce is the absolute man making sure everyone is satisfied with their order. I bring my guitar in and play songs for the staff and customers and Bruce always makes sure I'm fed. Top notch quality grub at affordable prices makes this place a win, win!
__label__5	Visited new Orleans last Tuesday and our first stop was Rum House! It was taco Tuesday $2 tacos!! The tacos were unlike anything I'd ever had in L.A.! Caribbean tacos....they were to die for! My favorite was the brisket! The queso blanco dip is A MUST!!! I was only in new Orleans for 4 days and instead of trying new foods I had to come back to rum house Thursday bc the food was that Amazing!!!!
__label__5	Go on Thursday's for the beer cheese soup.  Super spicy and delicious!  Creative menu and friendly staff. Thanks Rae's!
__label__5	"Parking here is super easy with the big lot,
I come here when I need to go to multiple stores cause a target is right around the block"
__label__5	I absolutely love this place. It's got an extremely large selection of international foods and it's all very clean and organized. The restaurant inside is amazing and I would highly recommend for its price and taste. Since my first visit I come often even though it's far from my home!
__label__5	This place is a solid choice for boba no doubt. Choose this place over Bings, tea spoon cafe, or cha time. You can thank me later
__label__5	This was my first time at Nola Bliss - Makenzi was so knowledgeable and considerate! She answered all of my questions and focused on all of my trouble spots. I will definitely be returning there!
__label__5	Best drury in metro east. Great rooms and great dinner and breakfast. The drink coupons are reasonable and the shower has soap and shampoo.
__label__5	I stumbled on this place at a mall and had very low expectations. But kid and I were hungry and this looked liked a better option than other chains. I had the cauliflower pizza and daughter had a salad. We were both delighted and super excited about our new find! Yay for healthier, good tasting quick food.
__label__5	First time in the city of New Jersey, feeling like having Pho for dinner. Found Pho Eden close to the hotel. Pho 311 isn't bad at all. Soup have goos flavor.
__label__5	Fesh catch of thr day was grouper. I had it broiler. Best grouper ever. Husbsnd loved the fried clams.
__label__5	Awesome authentic Mexican! Whenever I'm in the Wilmington area I make sure to make a stop. Staff is polite and very helpful in explaining the menu which has tons of options. Food is always delicious, the chorizo bean dip is my favorite. The restaurant is spacious and has a nice relaxed feel.. I wish there was one in Philly!
__label__5	One of my favorite restaurants around! Everything I have tried I love- especially the chicken parm and chicken asparagus. The portions are huge and I always have lunch for the next day. They serve the best olives and Caesar salad. My husband loves the garlic butter rib eye. This is always our go to restaurant. Highly recommend
__label__5	"Cute coffee/tea house with nice seating and located right on State st.

Ordered a nice cup of tea at a decent price. Yum..."
__label__5	Engaged, friendly and helpful staff.  Received text that both my glasses are in; was told to expect 7-10 days, but all is ready in 4 days.  I am excited to pick them up.  I was greeted and offered assistance by a few different staff members.  In the end the two who assisted me most, and are standout employees are Miguel and Gina.  Thank you for a good experience.
__label__5	AMAZING vegan eats! I was so impressed with Lulu's, and I'm so happy I finally got to try it out after months of driving past it. The menu is surprisingly vast, sure to please even meat eaters. I tried to Buffalo Cauliflower and it was a WIN. Unique and delicious, you can't help but eat all of them. The dining room was clean and pleasant, the staff was friendly, and the prices were absolutely reasonable for such fresh cuisine. I was absolutely impressed. I will be back!
__label__5	MUST STOP WHILE IN NASHVILLE! In the south we know our burgers y'all and these - THESE - so delicious! We grabbed some spots by the bar in the back on a warm breezy afternoon and drank some kolsch while waiting on our food. We each had our variations of the burgers and fries or tots and thoroughly enjoyed them. The buns are perfectly squishy, patties charred to perfection, and I highly recommend the cheese tots! Can't go wrong with a meal here anytime of the day!
__label__5	If you look are looking for a moving company that is dependable, efficient, careful, friendly and reasonable, then LOL is the one for you. They arrived right on time, were so helpful in placing our furniture and belongings in the proper places, and were so careful. I highly recommend them.
__label__5	This place received so much hype from my bf's dad, and choolah did not disappoint! You just can't go wrong with Big portions + reasonable price and pretty good quality as well actually.
__label__5	We had a gift card and came on a Tuesday night.  The food  was delicious.   My husband had a 12 oz rib eye.  He said it was the best he has had in years.  Alan was our server.  Excellent service.  AND they have cardboard take home boxes.
__label__5	"Randy at Big Bend Barber Shop is second to none. I literally drive 20+ miles to get my haircut with him and have been for over 15 years. You will not be disappointed with your cut, I guarantee it. Plus its an old school barber shop, laid back and great location! 

Highly Recommend!"
__label__5	everything embodied of philly is here! great people, food and drinks! i love it i love it im coming back!
__label__5	Great Subs and quality ingredients.  The bread is the best you'll taste(flown in from N.J.) and the meat is sliced per order.  Sub 16 has been our go to for packing travel sport lunches and other outdoor events.  Our golf league orders 8 - 10 every week to have out on the course.  Great people to work with when feeding a team or office group as well.  My suggestion is the Spicy Italian or Roast Beef, can't go wrong.
__label__5	Rose with Simply Perfection Cake did an awesome job on our wedding cake!  It was a beautiful and delicious three tier cake with Lemon with lemon mousse, Red Velvet with Chocolate Mousse, and Strawberry with White Chocolate mousse!  If you need any type of cake made, give Rose a chance because she did an AWESOME job!  Thanks for all of your hard work!!
__label__5	A classic sandwich done right. Bread is from a local bakery and workers checked in on us after we received our food. Lobster bisque wasn't our favorite but the sandwiches were!!!
__label__5	First time here!! Love the family vibe and handmade pizza! Pizza bowls were amazing and loved the variety of beers on tap!! We will definitely be back!
__label__5	Sure there's a lot of other options in downtown Boise but we can't pass up the great food and fantastic service here. Oh we try other places but we always end up wishing we would have gone back to Fork. In 4 days we ate here at least once a day for lunch or dinner. Grilled artichoke is irresistible! The measuring stick for all other places starts with Fork!
__label__5	Haven't actually been to the location, but I had their food at the annual Jazz Fest at the Fairgrounds. Let me say this -- if their food is that delicious at a festival, it must be AMAZING at the actual restaurant. The jama jama spinach was so flavorful! And the sweet fried plantains... yum!
__label__5	Tried the mixed taco plate. Chorizo, Carnitas, and chicken. The chicken was pretty good but the chorizo and the carnitas were absolutely amazing. Also loved the complementary chips and salsa. Will definitely return whenever I'm back in the Philly area.
__label__5	Been going here with my wife for years. Always pleased. Service is good. Takes time for the food to be served but I view this as good since it means that they don't just re-heat, the food is always fresh.
__label__5	Great service from the staff. They always serve me quickly and with a smile.I think you will agree with me. I don't know about some of the other reviews as this location doesn't have a drive through. I think there reviews belong to different DD locations.
__label__5	We stumbled upon this gem. Will be making the 30 min trek out here again just to eat here! We ordered the carne mechada, criollo, and pabellón arepas and  beef and chicken empanadas. The criollo has eggs sausage and cheese fantastic! My favorite was the pabellón with black beans shredded beef plantains and white cheese. The garlic sauce that comes with the empanadas is a must try. The staff was friendly and helpful and the food was great! Don't forget to grab a horchata  too!
__label__5	Love this place! The food is fire and the staff is friendly and conversational. Jamal is great. Always order the island bowl with Jamaican rice, spicy jerk chicken and add lamb...with corn, onions, peppers, and queso fresco with tomatoes.  Its amazing.  I add fiyah sauce/spice to it. The drinks are perfectly balanced as well. Mango drink and pineapple coconut are delicious and make you feel like you are sitting on an island.  5 stars.  All the way around
__label__5	Loved this restaurant! My first place to eat in Nashville and the food was spot on! I had the Peach Glazed Pork Chop and I highly recommend you try it. It comes paired with kinda like a quinoa/squash sauté mix as well, with a good buttery flavor to it! Don't leave without tasting the Strawberry Shortcake as well...it's so fresh and so perfect!
__label__5	"Yep, definitely have been missing out on this place. Best gyro I have had in Tampa to date! I will have to come back again with the lady because I just know she would love the greek salad I saw a few people dining on!

I also liked the setup of the place...walk up counter to order so you can take it out or dine in, which is pretty nice and calm inside.

The greek fries were also a favorite when I brought the rest back home!"
__label__5	This is my favorite Mexican food in the town.  You smell the authenticity.  Great food, big potion,  and nice staff there.   Good job!
__label__5	Great experience and tour. Great tour guide. Really enjoyed it. Loved the hello kitty jet ski :)
__label__5	I work across the street from Three Little Pigs & I love everything about this amazing West Chester lunch spot. The sandwiches are delicious & they have different specials available every day (Monday-Friday until 3pm). I wish they were open weekends so I could enjoy the back patio with friends.  I'd recommend this WC gem to anyone looking for something other than a corporate chain establishment.
__label__5	My wife and I did a couples massage to celebrate our anniversary and the staff couldn't have been more accommodating. This was our first time visiting and we really enjoyed ourselves. We have had many massages and visited a number of different spas across the country. I will definitely be back to this Spavia location and recommend it to anyone looking for an enjoyable spa experience.
__label__5	Always great food and great people. Welcomed as I come through and depart. Food us awesome.
__label__5	Had Lunch today Food was amazing along with scenery... Waitress Ashley was professional and attentive ... was a delightfully Dunedin experience
__label__5	I was very excited to find Biscuit Love in the Gulch!!! The decor, the food and the service was great! They even had a $5 valet service that left water in the coaster of my car. I was very satisfied with it all and you won't be disappointed!!!
__label__5	"If you are looking for the best biolage hair color, Jess is your girl. I have gone to several hair dressers and Jess is the only gal that has done the best job. Jess herself is an amazing soul and she comes to you. As a mother of two she makes it easy for me to get a touch up with the kids in the room. 
Jess also does makeup and special occasion hair. She's the best.  Thank you for 
All that u do, Jess u are so talented."
__label__5	This is the best pizza I have found in Missouri. The sauce, the cheese, the toppings...  Enough said, I'm off to get more right now!
__label__5	Just moved to New Orleans (Metairie area) and was looking for a cute breakfast place. I got just that, and more! I ordered the traditional breakfast with scrambled eggs. I was expecting your ordinary eggs, bacon, and potatoes but was pleasantly surprised! The bacon was nice and crisp, not floppy like other places. The eggs were fluffy and the potatoes were nice and done like I like them! I got an iced mocha that my amazing female server suggested and it hit the spot. I would suggest this place to everyone!
__label__5	Excellent food.  Had the St. Peter's dish. The Peach mimosa is outstanding. Sidewalk cafe allowed for people watching. Gets really packed after 10:00am. Lance was a great waiter.
__label__5	Girls!!! I LOVE LOVE LOVE ruby. She has been the person I go to for my brows for years. She has moved and I've gone with her and I'll keep following wherever she goes because she's that great. She gives you exactly what you want for your eyebrows. She honestly does a great job. Highly recommended.
__label__5	Awesome establishment!  If you are a whiskey lover, you will be in heaven here- Phil (the owner) is extremely hospitable and knowledgeable and has built an incredible collection of hundreds of bourbons, scotches and whiskeys from around the world.  The service is great and the BBQ is delicious.  If you are in St Louis do yourself a favor and visit BBQ Saloon- you won't be disappointed!
__label__5	Great place and great food and girls... I was caught off guard of a lovely lady asking about my rings. Usually my rings scare women, but this girl is fine. Had a chicken cheesesteak is as good a Philly style. Been to this place many times and continue to be a loyal customer, and maybe something more if the lady is a adult..
__label__5	"I walked in and the guy was really friendly. He gave me a hand out with pictures of the drinks and recommended me their best ones. I have no idea why I trusted him, but I did. It was probably because he was the one who makes the drinks. 

I got the top fruit and it was really good. It was the perfect mixture of tea and fruit. I know some other places that make the tea too strong that it's too bitter. 

I would also try crystal boba. It's chewier than normal boba and it lasts longer in the fridge!"
__label__5	"Spot on every time! 
This is our go to Korean spot. We have yet to have a single miss with any of their appetizers or entrees. Can't beat that consistency!"
__label__5	"I'm coming back to Clearwater, just for Frenchy's. 

Location - fabulous. 
Food - awesome (and yummy!)
Vibe - young, beach-y, fun
Decor - beach bar, lots of wall paintings, cool tables

The grouper is delicious. Don't leave this place without getting a grouper dish or sandwich."
__label__5	"Chicken fingers ""I'm gonna run a train on those...""
Great atmosphere and depending on if you like crowds or not the weekends are always packed so get there early if you wanna get a spot at the bar...music is always good with different DJs throughout the week"
__label__5	Best pretzels in the city, I have been going here for 25 plus years. Nothing beats a hot Philly Soft pretzel. There's nothiong really to say but perfection!!!!
__label__5	This is probably the best Italian in the south of Edmonton. Prices are great and portions are huge. I'm a huge fan and the service is consistent every visit. It's a little hidden as it's part of the complex in riverbend, but the food definitely does not disappoint.
__label__5	"I needed a gift for my aunt. I knew that I would find something ultra charming here . There are two floors of goodies to look through.there were bayberry candles and nostalgic kitchenware!! 
It's great to look through everything.
I must also tell you that you must wear your mask properly in the store. They also have a sanitation station.sanitize you hands by all means . 
Ornaments! How about a nice holiday pin for your teacher or mom. I love that stuff too."
__label__5	Uniboil serves many types of authentic Chinese hot pot dishes. The restaurant is clean and sanitary, and items containing common food allergens are marked on the menu. The food itself is flavorful. Portion sizes are just right and the service is great. Overall one of my favorite restaurants.
__label__5	"This is a very far drive for me, but super close to my ortho. Finally got to try it & I wasn't disappointed. It was SOOOOO GOOD! I loved every bit of it. Got Thai milk bubble tea w/ Vietnamese iced coffee ice cream. The ice cream is good by itself! I can eat a whole pint of that ice cream xD Thai tea tasted like Thai tea, nothing special about it. Boba was good, but could be chewier.

Overall, I would recommend!
Check out my reel on IG @joannlovesfood"
__label__5	"Best cheese steak I've ever eaten.

Fun neihboorhood to eat out side on the sidewalk 'dining area'.

Guys who work here are nice, and the place has some real charm."
__label__5	"We love the food this place and the pizza is really delicious. The meatballs are also awesome. The concept is great and ends all debates about what to get on a pie. 

I have been 3 or 4 times...on Friday it was PACKED and a long wait. But the manager did well and apologized to guests for the wait.  

My only critique would be they need a bigger oven!"
__label__5	AMAZING mediterranean food and great, affordable prices. The feast can easily feed 3 and each platter could feed 2 if you also get appetizers. It is a very small restaurant so it's not ideal for large parties to dine in, but they do offer carry-out! The platters and feasts offer many great little salad and sauce components
__label__5	Delicious tamales and frozen treats! Shake, ice cream, smoothies - you name it. Super awesome customer service and prices. Area is a tad sketchy but totally worth the food. So so good. Plus they have a drive thru, so you don't have to leave your car. 10/10 recommend
__label__5	Food was fantastic, service was inpecciable and both bartenders were extremely friendly and down to earth.  Will frequent this place often esp with summer coming up. Hoping tables will be put outside for outside seating.
__label__5	Great local Pasco business. They offer variety of fresh meat and offer several game options. Their are a little pricey but, the filets and ribeyes we purchased were fabulous!!!
__label__5	I've been to this bar a few times now and have always enjoyed it. They have a friendly and very knowledgeable staff. I'll keep coming back.
__label__5	"this place is adorable. 

no frills. no 3d or imax. no stadium seating.

lil' ole lady takes cash only and gives u a raffle ticket to get in.
man takes cash for old style buttered popcorn and small candy collection.

saw terrible bosses, midnight showing of last harry potter, and stupid crazy love here. $8 bucks each. no big deal.

awesome."
__label__5	Cap'n Cats is has the best raw and steamed clams anywhere I have ever been.  That is also true for their Clam Chowder and Bisque soups.  Amazing.  The bar is super friendly.  The mixed crab leg special usually can't be finished by two people.  The new zealand mussels are awesome.  And the smoked whiting is fantastic as well.  Package good store attached.  My favorite local place.
__label__5	Great atmosphere and wings made to perfection until closing time. Customer service was on point
__label__5	Everything I ate was amazing! Oysters, crab cakes, shrimp/scallop skewers, and creme brûlée...so yummy!!! Great views on the second floor.  Cannot wait to go again!
__label__5	Coming from New York I was trying to find the best spot in town to have a good time with good vibes and have yummy drinks. This place truly exceeded my expectations. Most places don't have the whole package , but the nugget is truly the spot. If I lived in Arizona This would for sure be my go to!!!! Management and staff was super welcoming and accommodating. Can't wait to come back.
__label__5	Wonderful service and amazing food.  The price is right too.  It's in an older building so it has a very quaint atmosphere.
__label__5	The food tastes very rich and fresh. I ordered a refridgerated plate that was pre-made. I paid with my EBT card, and they heat the food for free. There is a comfortable seating area with booths. The radio above was playing mellow fun music from early 2000's. They have a large TV in the corner and quarter machines at the door for toys. You can get popsicles here too $1.19 for a popsicle and $8.99 for the plate I got.
__label__5	We live about 10 minutes from here and it's one of our favorite places!  Such a fun place for the family!  They have different games like checkers, jjenga, connect four and many more. Beer is cold, Greek fries and gyros are delicious! And they have live music every night! Chris and nick are the ALL time best servers!!!  This is a must place to go to if you're visiting Clearwater beach!!
__label__5	Best Goat in Nashville! I love this place. Small and Intimate! Nice outside patio seating! When u smell the smoke coming from the grill outside u should come running. Food is fresh and you get alot of food for your money! I have had the goat, fish, and the chicken and they are all great! Plantains and other sides are great as well. This food will touch your soul!!
__label__5	Rockhill Vets showed great compassion when it had come time to put my old girl to sleep.  They provided a quiet room with all the time I needed to say goodbye and comfort her through her final minutes.
__label__5	I stopped in here for a quick to go drink. The place has a great patio for day drinking and you're allowed to bring dogs!! The drink was delicious and I could barely taste the alcohol in it (even though it was incredibly strong). I will definitely be back for an another drink and some food.
__label__5	This place knows what it takes to run a successful business. The host seated us outside quickly & the server took great care of us from there. The Greek salad & Veg Out Pizza were amazing. The decor and sculptures were a nice touch including live entertainment on the lawn. The staff is engaging, knowledgeable with a focus on guest service. Looking forward to my next visit.
__label__5	The beds here are great quality, it is very clean, and Susan the owner is a total sweetheart. Would highly recommend, she has nice specials too!
__label__5	Great place to eat sushi! Food quality has been very consistent every time we have been there(which is at least twice a month). Service has always been good with very attentive staff. Owner is very welcoming and accommodating. Would definitely recommend.
__label__5	Been wanting to go here for brunch and finally went! So delicious! Only waited a short time before being seated. Service was prompt and great! My friend and I ordered the rize and shine mochas that was an amazing spiked coffee drink. We then shared a delicious seasonal mango pop tart as our starter. I then ordered the garden frittata with crispy potatoes and she ordered the mango spicy salad. Great time and great food. Will definitely be back!
__label__5	Very clean and friendly staff! Would highly recommend any of their services. Great manicure/pedicures!
__label__5	Stopped in for a quick lunch. Great bake potato soap and a crispy chicken salad and fantastic service. Left me full and satisfied will save in my list of Tampa favorites.
__label__5	My friend and I stumbled into this place looking for an iced coffee. We found the most delightful and engaging women behind the counter who gave us insider's tips on the best bars to frequent in NOLA. We had delicious ice coffees and I tasted the buttermilk drop which was fabulous! Definitely worth a visit :)
__label__5	Absolutely thee BEST torta I've ever had!! The carnitas were very, very lean and the bread was so fresh! This place has great food but this was the first time I've tried the torta. Do your tastebuds a big favor and order one as soon as you can. You'll be glad you did.
__label__5	I totally enjoyed this place. The food was great and the service was pleasant. I meant take a picture before enjoying it- cant was to have it later!!!!!
__label__5	"Went through drive-thru and they were fast and efficient even with a long line! My Mom loved her wake up wraps once again!

Went inside today and the staff were working hard, my coffee was hot, and our four Boston Cream day nuts were soft and fresh! The drive thru goes onto Frankford Ave. so I find it better to go inside."
__label__5	Their food is sooo fresh and i love the huge portion size. I always get the chicken kabobs with the rice. I am never disappointed. Always a great fast and friendly staff there and im always receiving cool gifts from the zoes kitchen app. I love this place!
__label__5	my window pane broke, one of those little french four panel windows. jeff was able to cut the glass to fit and fix it with no problem, even with all the rain we've been having lately. didn't even let my cats out either, they're window sitters. he also left behind two more panels of the same size glass. 10/10 great customer service, nice guy, and great work! will def use him again for any other fixing needs!
__label__5	Amazing! Best sushi I have ever eaten. Thank you Carlos!! Service was very fast and friendly and the sushi was delicious. Definitely my favorite place in Reno for sushi!
__label__5	Was passing by in Philadelphia that week and thought I should look for a poutine. I have a habit of looking for that in every state I go to. Not disappointed at all, the cheese is squeaky, fries are crispy and the sauce is right on. They  add smoked briskets which makes it even better. The place wouldn't be what it is for its atmosphere and the people gathered there. Very welcoming.
__label__5	Fantastic experience.  The service was exceptional and the food was delicious.  My daughter is vegetarian and the chef has a vegetarian pasta that was excellent.  We were treated like kings and would definitely recommend going. Great food great service.
__label__5	Amazing!! The appetizers were the best I've ever had.. From any restaurant! I had the walnut crusted bacon with brown sugar and the smothered fries. Let me tell you that I was in HEAVEN. Absolute heaven. I could eat those all day alone. The ribs and sides I got were good but after having the appetizers, nothing beat those. I would love to come back and try other options on the menu.
__label__5	"Not going to write away here.

Amazing lunch spot with their daily lunch deals, the people behind the counter are so nice and warm, always welcoming! 

Food so delicious, that one day I got sick and threw up after dinner [nothing to do with their food, something I ate earlier] and this food still tasted good while I was throwing up, no joke. 

Soups aren't bad either. Easy, fast and Cheap. Love it!"
__label__5	We travel to the Tarpon Springs area about 3 times a year and Rusty Bellies is ALWAYS on our eating out list. Never disappointed. Great food, great service-- always a great experience.
__label__5	This place was awesome (and I've had some pretty delicious Mexican food in Texas)!! We got 8 tacos, and they were all super yummy. The fish, shrimp, steak, chicken, carnitas, and barbacoa were all tasty, and all the other fresh ingredients and spices made these tacos very flavorful.  The atmosphere was great, with indoor and two outdoor areas.  The prices were reasonable too.  It was a perfect spot for lunch!
__label__5	"New location is very well done, and well worth a visit. 

Food was tasty, and we were excited to take part of if the first Saturday tour!

Keep up the good work."
__label__5	I have been coming here for over a year, I trust anyone to do my mani or pedi. I usually always get gel on my nails and it lasts an entire 2 weeks no chipping.
__label__5	"Using the drive through is ALWAYS a delight. At this particular location they seem to ""get it"" and always get my order correct. In a world full of ups and downs this is a constant- yes. In honesty I have never stepped foot ""inside"" as I am usually in a hurry. But as far as accuracy in the drive through-- it is great. Thank you team."
__label__5	Long time customer and I make quite a drive to come here. It's worth it. Best liquor store I've ever been to. Great service, fantastic prices, and super knowledgeable staff. Couldn't ask for more.
__label__5	Okay. So far the best bar I have found in Nashville. A lot of people my age 20-30ish, great food and the most amazing  beer menu I've seen in a while. This will definitely become a regular place for me to visit on the weekends.
__label__5	Came out here with my husband for work. This is one of thee best Mexican food places I have ever been to in my whole life. I had the chicken with rajas plate with beans and rice and the Chile verde dip appetizer and the green salsa was soooo good I can't even say enough good things about this place. If you're in town and are craving good authentic Mexican food this is the place to go.
__label__5	Went there Sunday morning. Not packed at all. We were seated right away. Our server was very nice and patient with us. We all got something different. You can see from the pictures. I got the traditional breakfast. Let me tell you the biscuit was nice and warm. Very light didn't feel too doughy. The restroom was nice. Very private doors were no one can peep in. The place itself was very nice and inviting. Next trip I'm definitely trying their pancakes and French toast. I saw another table order them and it looked soo good.
__label__5	We just got our twins birthday cake here for a second year in a row and we have been pleased both times! The cake is fresh, delicious, and very pretty! The cupcakes are very good as well.
__label__5	I was introduced to Sullivans in Tucson and the food there is excellent. The King of Prussia Sullivan's food was excellent also. I will definitely go back.
__label__5	Dog Gone Amazing helped me train my two puppies. Malaika, is wonderful to work with and has an amazing facility and great staff. I have also left my puppies for boarding, my dogs love the walks, and I love the pictures and texts I get on a daily basis while I am away. I have highly recommended Dog Gone Amazing to my friends.
__label__5	A great place to eat. Best atmosphere and workers. I always visit this place to eat when I come to town. Highly recommended for everybody.
__label__5	FABULOUS breakfast! Went close to 8:00 a.m. on a Saturday morning and had a few tables to choose from. Egg white omelettes were delicious. Got a free mini pancake thanks to yelp and their was nothing mini about it! Service outstanding! A definite must visit!
__label__5	"I call these Gyros my ""crack"". Totally awesome food. I've been trying to find great Gyros here in Tucson for a long time. Found em! They're fries and salads are really good as well!"
__label__5	Very welcoming host, excellent tapas, great service. Enjoyable dinner all together romantic ambience. Real Italian!
__label__5	Top notch 5 star portrait art museum of one of the greatest modern artists of all time.  A hefty admission price but the pieces inside are incredible.  Great extensive gift shop.  While we were there they had a virtual reality exhibit which was three minute long with the glasses and a rotating chair complete with visual and audio,  one of the best parts.  They also offer guided tours for free.
__label__5	Really impressed with the customer service! Very nice people, and super helpful. Great location!
__label__5	If I could give this Driving School 10 Stars I definitely would!!! I called and spoke with Jai the day before my daughter's driving test and he scheduled her appointment for when we needed it 20 mins later.. Instructor Nadia; was very prompt picking my daughter up, she took her for a few practice runs, and by mid morning my daughter came home with her Drivers License!!! Before you call anyone else, call Express Driving School...
__label__5	"A very nice place to go to. I get a yummy dessert with a yummy cappuccino. My friend had told me about this place and that I should go there. 

So for the first time I went with my wife for a mid day coffee and desert. Prices were reasonable and desserts were excellent. I recommended tring this cafe out. You will not be disappointed. Also very nice staff :)"
__label__5	"Stopped in here to get everything I needed to make sushi and a couple sauces.  They had a wide variety of sauces, a whole aisle of bowls & plates, and tons of fresh food.

Make sure you go to the back left-hand side of the store.  Tons of live fish, shrimp, crayfish, eel, and other seafood.  There's even another room beyond the tanks that has more dried goods (pasta & the like), but also prepared food.  There's a counter way in the back with some tasty-looking prepared foods!"
__label__5	Bacon chips with guac!!  Why isn't this offered everywhere?!  I am so sad that place opened after I did my Whole 30 but it was still worth the visit!  The ambiance and decor are great and the cocktails were special!  We were both surprised at how much we liked the bone broth bowls (and how we didn't miss the added meat).  It was delicious and we left feeling much better because we had not overeaten and eaten wholesome food.  A great addition to the Indy food scene.
__label__5	"Great food--great prices!
I work night shift and have been to Tin Roof only in the morning, and I am impressed by how tasty and inexpensive the food is. The variety of breakfast tacos is good--there are meaty and meatless ones available. LOVE the salsa! The staff are friendly and know the menu. There is a nice covered patio with a fire pit. All in all a good choice."
__label__5	"I wandered in almost 3 years ago for a drop-in haircut. I've been going back since. Great haircuts; great atmosphere. John, Eric and Gary are all top notch. This is what a barbershop school be. Don't forget to  donate to the ""green"" fee!"
__label__5	We went on opening day . I had the chicken capers sandwich which had some kind of balsamic vinegar on the bread it was so tasty we also had the avocado chicken panini that was just blasting with flavor. The staff was very welcoming and they even offered us free samples of there healthy smoothies. We will come back for sure.
__label__5	Went for Taco Tuesday. They were also having an event, and having just opened, I was a little worried. However, everything was great, the servers tried their hardest to make us happy.  PS: this is more Texmex style, not authentic. Keep that in mind.
__label__5	"Diana's is the best bakery for Mexican sweets that I have seen in St. Louis.

She has a great selection of  Mexican cookies, piernas, sweet empanadas, conos, churros, sweet biscuits, flan and my favorite...  tres leches cake (a sponge cake with fruit layers, soaked in sweet milks).  If you've never had tres leches, you must try it!!  It's scrump-diddly-iscious!!"
__label__5	Super nice people! Family-owned spot, and the food is super delicious, not oily/greasy at all like some other Jamaican food I've had. Everything seemed fresh and homemade. And ask for their hot sauce if you like spicy.. I mean really really spicy, but so good, it's a homemade mango habenero sauce that I'd probably eat with anything.
__label__5	Took a friend here today and they never dissapoint.  The staff is always gracious, friendly and the food is excellent.  Best Tom Yum in the city.  I am a fussy eater and this place has the best Thai Food around Center City.  My friend was very impressed!  I had Sweet Basil with tofu and veggies and he had Chicken pad Thai.  and he had Excellent.  The Mango Sticky Rice was perfect as a desert! Love this place!
__label__5	We love their small chopped Greek salad.  It is generous and delicious.  Loaded with Greek Potato  salad, Greek peppers, kalamata olives, shrimp...all you the tasty items you would expect.  Always made fresh, to order.  Accompanied with fresh French bread.  Yum.
__label__5	I'm not one to take time to write reviews, but after eating here today, I must encourage  others to give them a try. I had the best florentine benedict I have ever tested! Everything was fresh. a find like this gem needs to stick around.....go try it. The people are welcoming and our server was friendly and attentive..
__label__5	We love this place, and so does our dog.  I think the best recommendation is that my dog is thrilled when we take her to see the groomers.
__label__5	We had a great time with the alpacas. Very informative and fun. Alpacas are great kissers.
__label__5	Stopped in today since we were in the neighborhood. People have been talking about this place for years. We didn't know we needed reservations - so lucky they had 2 extra pies! Thin crust, fresh tasting (and a little sweet) sauce and sparsely dotted with cheese. Perfect. The white pizza with tomato, spinach and garlic was amazing. Bland atmosphere with paper plates and napkins, styrofoam cups (!), no flatware. But...the service was great! Pricy but worth it!
__label__5	Best restaurant we visited while in NOLA.  The courtyard is gorgeous, the service was impeccable and the food and drinks were delicious!  I had the Jerked Pork Tenderloin which was so flavorful and spicy.  My husband had the ahi tuna which was so tasty!  The only con to this place is that the chairs outdoors aren't comfortable.
__label__5	"Scot B. Was very helpful and accommodating. He went above and beyond as all folks at Hutchinson have done for me previously. 
Thanks Hutchinson"
__label__5	"Went to Burger Mongers twice this week.  First time was for one of their high quality burgers with tomatoe, grilled onions, lettuce and provolone cheese.   It was outstanding.  It was so good that I brought a friend a few days later.  She thought it was one of the best hamburger she ever had.   I tried the chicken enjoyed every bite.  We shared an order of fries.   Fresh not frozen.  

Service  was outstanding, manager asked if we need refills for our water and soda. I recommend this restaurant to everyone."
__label__5	Very great atmosphere! Julissa helped me and my family through the menu with awesome suggestions! The food was yummy! I ordered the fried shrimp and it was perfectly seasoned not over fried like some places! Thanks we will return for Peruvian cuisine soon!
__label__5	Their happy hour! And those greens and FRIED CORN ON THE COB! They need to take that corn to the fair its like drizzled with heavenly honey butter or something. Lol... no but seriously I had the grilled turkey ribs with the cranky sauce on the side with a side of greens and that damn fried corn and it was tender and tasty! I will definitely be back!
__label__5	Delicious and fun! An employee suggested the OG Fire, and I was blown away. The spicy salmon was fresh, and the burrito had just the right amount of crunch and spice. Will definitely come back!
__label__5	"The place have a really nice ambiance, the service was amazing they were super attendant the hole
Time. We ordered calamari to start meat ravioli and tortellini a la panna everything was delicious , good sized portion . Definitely coming back"
__label__5	Best tacos that I've had in Tampa. I like Taco Bus and California Tacos, but Loli's wins the taste test. Every time I go there I get impatient waiting for my food (they're always busy), and then once I eat the food I remember why I keep coming back. Totally worth waiting in line for.
__label__5	"Sometimes i observe to see if the person checking in the guests treats everyone with the same demeanor. I have to say Frank who was on duty the night i stayed at IBTH was awesome! Down to earth with a good sense of humor and had the inside line for local hot spots etc. This a quick review to tell Frank and the others at IBTH, you are doing a great job and i appreciate the hospitality! 

PS: Did i mention they had cookies and wine upon check in? BONUS!"
__label__5	"Ordered here during the stay at home order. We opted for delivery which was nice and quick. Everything came exactly how we ordered! We got wings (crunchy) sauces on side, cheese fries and pizza with half
Pepperoni. This place is consistently delish!"
__label__5	We got lucky and came at a really good time on a Thursday evening.  Parking was easy out front of the restaurant and we were seated immediately.  My wife was craving Thai food and found this location on Yelp so we gave it a go.  Really glad we did.  The location was really charming and the staff very nice.  I had Gai Yang and it was the perfect level of heat.  Vegetables along side of it were good as well.  There wasn't a ton of seating, which is why I said I think it we got lucky with our timing.
__label__5	Come here for a quick snack because we were at park place mall and will definitely be returning! I had the mahi taco was not disappointed. I am pretty picky about fish tacos but this was delicious. I would definitely recommend going there if you are craving a taco and they had plenty of choices. You order at the counter and they bring your food to you, but the place is pretty nicely decorated. They also have a salsa bar with their homemade salsas which is always a plus!
__label__5	My favorite place to go for brunch! Great to bring friends and family. All of the sandwich and omelette choices... absolute bliss. They are also handling the COVID situation very well, with minimal contact. Based on past experience, it does get fairly busy and wait times can get high. The staff is also very friendly.
__label__5	This is the best restaurant in Delaware, hands down. The food is authentic and Luigi and Doris are the most wonderful hosts.
__label__5	I've had the opportunity to eat here twice in the last month and both times were equally great.  The servers were attentive and efficient.  Food was delicious.  Nice menu with small twists on traditional fare.  Plenty of items to choose from too.  The atmosphere is comfortable with indoor and outdoor seating options.  Good selection at the bar too.  Will definitely come back again when in the area.
__label__5	Fast service! Great chili Colorado burrito! Also had white queso dip!Chile ColoradoChile ColoradoChile Colorado
__label__5	I love this nail salon!  It's very pretty inside with gorgeous chandeliers. Everyone is extremely nice and they all do a great job. It's usually crowded because they ARE so good. They except walk-ins, but you should make a reservation or you will probably have to wait. I highly recommend One Nail Lounge. The wait is worth it!
__label__5	"Just had a crown done at this office! 
painless and  fast! And what is most important the managment was willing to work with payment option.
Thank you Abington Smile Center!
Would highly recommend !"
__label__5	I love garlic parmesan zingers from Miller's Ale House. No one has a better garlic parm sauce than Miller's. We always ask for extra sauce because it's that good. The zinger mountain melt is also amazing. It's fries with cheese, bacon, zingers of your choice, and ranch piled high. The tenders are very meaty, not a lot of breading. Always very happy when I leave!
__label__5	Omg first time here.  Had the Oatmeal Cookie with white cream sandwich.  It was amazing.  I checked in with yelp and was offered a free cupcake.  This place is amazing.  The ambience is very relaxing if you plan on sitting in.
__label__5	"The salespeople are are amazing! They made my car buying experience so easy. They listened to what my family needs were and helped me find the perfect car for my family of 5! 

The level of customer service was outstanding! We love our Escalade. It has been alittle over a month that we've had it. The car runs perfectly and we couldn't be happier. 

I would recommend this dealer to my friends and family!"
__label__5	This place was just amazing! Best food I have ever had in my life. My husband and I both had the ribeye with smashed Yukon potatoes and broccoli. We could not get enough of it! The drinks were amazing, dessert was out of this world good, service was great, lovely atmosphere... I have absolutely nothing bad to say! Beautiful hotel as well!!
__label__5	My favorite place for pizza on cheat day! Add panko chicken on your next pizza. You won't be disappointed. Restaurant is clean and servers are friendly. This place is perfect for family dinner or date night.
__label__5	The train is awesome, totally worth it. Great selection on the train and the chef is just fantastic!! There's two specifically that we absolutely love! They'll make you things to try and are just fun to watch. Super fresh and just delicious!
__label__5	Man With a Van came through for me on short notice after Bellhops screwed me over. I lived on a very narrow street and Man With a Van had no problem accessing my house. Very efficient and affordable.
__label__5	My most favorite place to get my nails done ever!! The staff is friendly and amazing at what they do! The ambiance is gorgeous relaxing and clean. I usually get clear dip with extensions and a pedicure.
__label__5	"Fishtails Seafood Market
Great for fresh seafood and great frozen items such as lobster tails, breaded shrimp and much more.  Also, fabulous homemade crab cakes and chowders!!!  Won't be disappointed."
__label__5	Fantastic shop and great owner.  Good selection of LOCAL and REGIONAL yarns as well as other movers and shakers.  The store is bright and inviting and well laid out.  They keep everyone up to date with great newsletter and an active facebook feed.  I felt very welcomed and comfortable in the store.
__label__5	We had a birthday/ St Patrick's Day Party at Brick House Tavern and it was very nice!  They had a large table set for us and our server was pleasant, courteous and attentive. We had several appetizers including the the calamari which was particularly good.  I had the Sirloin Tips and they were excellent. Everyone in our large party (12) raved about the food.  Great selection of beer and the cocktails were good too.
__label__5	"SO good! The line is definitely long so join the waitlist ahead of time if you want to avoid waiting when you arrive. The portions are very large (in hindsight, would have shared a meal because of the large portions). We had ""The Peacemaker"" where you can choose two different eggs Benedict. We ordered the Eggs Cochon and The Chicken St Charles. The Eggs Cochon was the hands down winner. If you're looking for a good brunch place this is a must!"
__label__5	"Score! 
This place is great. You have to remember you get what you pay for. So I was pleasantly surprised.  Clean and modern room with a good use of the room.  We got a room overlooking the pool which was nice
 Great water pressures and a tv that works.  We have spent more for less. This is a good deal!"
__label__5	Great little family restaurant stop for breakfast. Quick, attentive service and a very big menu with lots of options. Everyone at my table left very full and satisfied! I got the quiche and ate every bite!
__label__5	The sushi is my favorite in New Orleans. I loved the black and gold roll it's absolutely delicious. Also the spring rolls are amazing. Highly recommend this place! Service was wonderful as well. :-)
__label__5	"Recently shifted to Joshua and they did the initial service and came in between initial and first service to do my garage and treat moles who appeared in my backyard all of a sudden. 
Great service and quick turnaround. So far, very good."
__label__5	"Excellent produce department. We had alot of questions on produce and they assisted with everything and were very knowledgeable. Deli team also so helpful. We had a lot of questions on products and wanted special sandwiches and they did all. This is a ""CAN DO"" type of place, very refreshing !"
__label__5	Positive. I got six tacos there plus rice and beans to go and have a couple Modelos while I was waiting. It's a nice place, I don't know what the person was saying when they talked about the tables being held together with string and clothes pins, that's ridiculous. It's a nice place and I recommend it, the food is good, the service is good, No language barrier that I noticed, I'll be back. The food is good, check it out.
__label__5	"Best cheesesteak in the city!!!  And I have to admit, the steak isn't much to look at.  First time I ordered one and unwrapped, I was prepared to feel disappointed.  Nope.

I like the high quality sliced steak they use.  Rolls are fresh and delicious.  This is the kind of steak that is good with just the meat and wiz.  That's how good it is."
__label__5	These guys are terrific. Been going there for 20 years (including their old location in Plymouth Meeting) and they're always upbeat, courteous and have awesome meats. You can go elsewhere and pay much more for high quality meat they sell at Venizia's at a much lower price.  And they have killer porkette. They always make me feel as though they appreciate my business.  I grill steaks all the time and my guests always remark about the quality of the meat. Thank you, Carl Venezia and Company - you guys are the best.
__label__5	Can't say enough good things about Finn McCools, its staff & especially the owners. Always a great time. Fun & friendly patrons make you feel welcome. Great mix of any sports events. Staff is so lovely I always want to tip as much as my bill. Great variety of beers plus just good drinks all around. Anytime is a good time to go. Plus if you get hungry Boo Koo BBQ is right inside & Mona's is just down the street.
__label__5	I'm from out of town looking for a good breakfast spot close to my hotel and this was perfect.   Nice local breakfast and lunch place in what seems to be light warehousing area.  The breakfast burrito was awesome , love grits and they even serve the cuban espresso coffee with milk  that I like too. Service was friendly, food was good and the price was right.
__label__5	I am not sure why there are some negative reviews because this is hands-down the best Mexican in St. Louis. It is super authentic and unique. The tamales are the highlight, while there guac is outstanding as well. There is always at least one table and they prepare your order quickly. I can agree that maybe the service isn't the best, but it's an order-at-the-counter place so I don't know what people expect. Must go if you're a true Mexican fan.
__label__5	I've been here only a handful of times, but it seems whether they look slammed or not, they can always handle the crowd. The service is always great, and the food fresh, hot, and plentiful. what more could you ask for?
__label__5	In my opinion the very best restaurant in Philadelphia and maybe the world.
__label__5	"Best Pizza Ever!
Great Slices.
Pepperoni and Bourbon Chicken Slices are Perfect.
Will go here again when I'm in New Orleans."
__label__5	My favorite breakfast in New Orleans during my last visit. Bloody Mary was ridiculous - the pickled green bean and bacon just put it over the top.  Lots of room, friendly service, quick wait times, some outdoor seating for nicer days. Food was fantastic. Wait staff offered excellent recommendations and were helpful in pointing out a Yelp special they were running for a coupon towards the Bloody Mary for a check-in.
__label__5	I just went to this place for the first time and let me tell you I will definitely be going back it was extremely reasonable I went with some friends and we had all kinds of food.. empanadas, stuffed potatoes pulled pork, ribs, beans and rice and it was all phenomenal! Can't wait to go back
__label__5	I've visited this location a couple of times, the staff are very friendly and helpful. They give you a little rundown of everything before you get into the room. The clues have a flow to them, which I've found not all Escape places do. It's easier to go from clue to clue to get out..hopefully. Thank you!
__label__5	Ran across this cigar shot and was excited to see them hand rolling cigars since I've never seen that before. The staff was friendly and recommended the Dalá which I enjoyed. I got a few extra to take back home to Va for my son. I would highly recommend a stop if you're ever in Tampa
__label__5	I love this place. I live right around the area and they have always done a great job. They are affordable, they get the job done quickly, and they even replaced a few missing buttons on my suit without me even asking. Don't be afraid of the bad reviews in 2010 and 2011.
__label__5	"This is the best and fastest walk in clinic I've ever been to. The wait isn't bad. I've never waited more than half an hour. There's never too many people in the waiting room. The staff are nice, especially the doctors and physicians assistants. They know their stuff. 

I only wish they had more resources. I was just sent to the er next door because they don't have a cat scan. I'd rather be at the walk in clinic than at the Florida hospital er."
__label__5	Great food.    The service here is good.  They have a pretty cool set up inside and the gelato is yum
__label__5	Great atmosphere, food and service. Absolutely a must visit. Will definitely be going back!
__label__5	"OMG!
Ok this is what you need to do when in Santa Barbara!
The price is right, the water is beautiful and you might even see some dolphins. The staff is so nice and helpful. 
Try and get a mid-afternoon reservation. The water is more calm then, but you still might have some of that morning fog. It's burned off by noon or 1pm, but the water can get a little choppy then.
Great for families! They have boats and jet-skis. A must-do!"
__label__5	Favorite spot in New Hope. Pretty setting, with wrap-around windows that open up during nice weather, and an ever-changing list of wines, whiskeys, and other drinks, which they offer in flights. It's a great spot to get a drink, or a light meal. Their korean chicken wings are awesome.
__label__5	The best place to enjoy authentic Indian cuisine. This place is unique in its own way. Never seen every item on the menu taste this amazing. I loved goat biriyani but my personal favorite were desserts. They had rice pudding, rasamalai, gulab jamun on their menu. Each of these items were fantastic. We couldn't stop eating even after being full.
__label__5	Tye does an amazing job, they responded quickly and everything was perfect. A friend puked in my car and they cleaned it all up and and got rid of all the smells. Plus, my car looks better than it did before I got it. I highly recommend.
__label__5	I had a good time on my date , the waiter was so nice . The music was great and the environment. Great evening I would recommend this place and I give it a 10.
__label__5	I come to this location about once a week in the mornings. The lady named Alex is worth coming here. She is the most polite and helpful person. Alex is everything you would want from a customer service person. She is great! Thank you Alex!
__label__5	We had a great New Year's dinner here. The four of us shared an antipasto followed by gnocchi before our entrees. Gnocchi and lamb dishes were our highlights. Will definitely return!
__label__5	The best nature/day trip close to Philadelphia. The staff is super friendly and informative and we always see a bunch of turtles sunning themselves on logs along the Batsto River.
__label__5	My friend and I are here for training​ and decided to try Does Doe's...so glad we did! We were a little worried about the wait when we were looking for parking but got in really quick. Food was great, people were friendly and I definitely recommend it!
__label__5	"I took my son to Shagun for the first time as he likes to try different foods and likes to cook. He loved the food! When he was he was looking thru the kitchen glass at the naan cooker, Happy brought him back to meet the cook, Pedro, and show him how they make naan. Kevin thought it was so cool! I'm sure we will be coming back soon!
Happy, the manager, takes great care of you! 
Thanks for the experience Happy and the food of course.
Check out Shagun - you won't be disappointed.
- Tom P."
__label__5	Loved their pure açaí bowl and vanilla charcoal soft serve. The staff was very friendly (especially the cashier) and the portions were perfect. They even let us sample, which was super helpful as it was our first time. Plus we were able to bring our dog since they had outdoor seating! Will definitely visit again.
__label__5	I've been to Letty's several times since it opened earlier this year and each time was phenomenal. I think they have some of the best cocktails in Kennett. All of the tavern fare that I've tried has been outstanding, but my favorite food at Letty's is the pizza. The margherita is phenomenal and the white pizza is so cheesy and delicious. I'd recommend Letty's to anyone.
__label__5	Great neighborhood burger place! The sides are all hand cut, burgers are delicious, and wings are smoked and flavored to perfection. Great for kids, there's a nice jungle gym with picnic tables for outdoor seating in the cooler months.
__label__5	I loved the vibe of this place - fun music, beautiful interiors, friendly staff. And the food was even better. I definitely plan to return and try more dishes. The cauliflower was a favorite of the night and the smoked mussel toast is a must! Everyone loved the chicken to end our meal and you can't go wrong with any of the oysters. They fly them in fresh daily. Excited to have another go-to spot in Nashville!
__label__5	A bit pricey but absolutely delish. Clean, accommodating and super helpful staff. Everything I tasted (which was a lot) was wonderful.
__label__5	Delicious and wonderful! Server was great and atmosphere was chill. I would definitely recommend this place to friends.
__label__5	The definition of established cuisine in Santa Barbara: Bouchon is fine dining French food with a nice California twist on many items. The wine list is consistently rated one of the best in the region. I ordered the lamb chops and my partner ordered the sea bass- both cooked to perfection and with a really lovely wine pairing. However, the most memorable aspect of our fine dining experience was the dessert Syrah. It's so difficult to make a delicious dessert Syrah, so we had to try it and boy were we impressed. Save room for that dessert!
__label__5	I always wanted a half and half and I finally got one here.  The drink was done right.  The bartender was friendly and everything there looked nice.  Ill be going back to try more than a drink sometime.  Authentic irish pub with a live violinist playing irish music.
__label__5	Seriously so tasty. My new favorite place to eat in Boise - the fried chicken is so juicy!! And they have fried green tomatoes and okra. Their mixed drinks were also some of the best I've had, and very customizable! I would go here for a quick drink after work with friends, or dinner time on a date. Ambiance is 10/10
__label__5	"Any time I have a friend visit from out of town I immediately take them here. Whether you're a grill master, foodie, tea lover, or just happen to be in the neighborhood, you will love this place! 

My favorites are their lemon sugar for on top of lattes, their za'atar for lebnah, and my favorite favorite is their candied ginger. Definitely try it! 

Feel free to sample anything and the owners are SO HELPFUL. You can really tell they are passionate about food and their business. Love this place!"
__label__5	This place is perfect. Dog friendly with complimentary doggy water bowls! Yummy food (the taco possibilities are endless). Lethal to mild salsas and sauces are readily available. Friendly staff. I'll be back.
__label__5	When we got there it was a 45 min - 1 hr wait. It's worth the wait to be honest. I had a chicken St.Charles  and boy let me tell you the it was bomb. I got my egg fried but listen the biscuit melted in my mouth lawdddd I wish we had this in Florida
__label__5	Ambler pizza is always delicious.  Try the Upside Down Tomato Pie and the Meat Lovers Pizza, both are awesome!  The owner and staff are wonderful.
__label__5	Love the view! Its amazing to see 2 states in one location and the lights at night makes for a wonderful back drop against the night sky. The pod is a it tiny but where else can you go and ride like Mork???
__label__5	Wonderful family owned health food store! They have everything from herbs, teas, honey, protein, vitamins, supplements, vegetarian foods, snack mixes, and all natural beauty products. The staff is very knowledgeable, and very helpful! They also sell FRESH HOT roasted peanuts that taste as delicious as they smell! Definitely worth the trip to Germantown.
__label__5	Best BBQ I've ever had. The meat was so tender and juicy. I had the tritip plate, my husband had the pulled pork plate and our son had the 4 rib plate. The food was delicious. We will definitely go back.
__label__5	Gluten free bread option!  Yes not as fun as the sourdough, but sure appreciated!  Pastrami was phenomenal, coleslaw was light & refreshing, service was exceptional, enviro busy but somehow wRm & welcoming too!  I was impressed by the multi seating options for people waiting for food... in addition to the indoor & seating.
__label__5	My first time at any Halal Guys and I received exceptional customer service and accommodation for my vegan diet. My falafel wrap tasted great and  I'll definitely be back anytime I'm in town.
__label__5	"Great food and amazing beer. Nice atmosphere especially on a Friday and sat nights. Half price appetizers for happy hour, can't beat that.

Warning,  do not go to triumph in Princeton..nothing like the new hope location."
__label__5	Excellent brunch. The squash fritters with crawfish are amazing. Best Bloody Mary in New Orleans.
__label__5	I thought John's was good, but then I found they make a cinnamon swirl donut, but instead of glaze they put chocolate icing on it. Fantastic. No longer must you choose. All your donut dreams come true. Now I think John's is great.
__label__5	"The food was great (especially the gumbo!) and the service was excellent. Very short wait time and big portions. 10/10
Will come again :)"
__label__5	great pizza & great prices! everyone is very nice there too definitely a good late night pizza place as well
__label__5	Just in town visiting. Was able to walk in and get a wonderful pedicure. Clean. Quiet. Beautiful salon. Great customer service
__label__5	Hands down best dental group in the country. Git Invisalign through their Ortho department and couldn't be happier with the service and results. Big thanks To Dr KC, the fabulous Jessica, Katie, Kassy and Duli. I highly recommend Sala for anyone and their families.
__label__5	Fresh, healthy and delicious!  So glad they came to Brandon.  Love sitting outside with the live music on weekends.
__label__5	Holy guacamole! We are visiting SB and stumbled upon Rudy's. It was beyond our expectations. First, the portions are for Sumo wrestlers. Second, the food is great! We had the beef chimi, Rudy's Big Beef Enchilada (the name doesn't lie) and the potato taquitos. Everything was delicious-highly recommend.
__label__5	I love this place.  So much incredible food it is hard to choose what/where to eat. This visit I decided on a Turkey Special at Original Turkey. It was outrageous.  Dessert at Terminis.  It does, understandably, get crowded.
__label__5	"Taco Sunday's are the best day ever here!! Especially if Will is throwing down in the kitchen.
Best little Sunday throw back bar around. #tacos #sundayfunday"
__label__5	Great quality job, and friendly staff! I love my tint and I will definitely recommend this shop!
__label__5	My dad and I stopped in here for a quick lunch and the food was pretty awesome. Definitely felt like I was back in Israel. Very authentic and homemade. I'd highly recommend it.
__label__5	"I bought a boat and worked with Craig Jackson.  He kept his eyes open for me and called when the perfect boat came in.  He has a relaxed style and never exerted pressure during the process.  He is very customer service focused and even encouraged me to call with any questions after the sale - including weekends (which I took him up on).  

Kelly Moore in their service department has also been very good and accommodating.  Overall, I am 100% satisfied with the entire Thunder Marine team."
__label__5	"This is unlike other university-owned museum, but is filled with tons of valuable and beautiful collections all over the space.  (See the pic)

The building of the University of Tampa originally served a luxurious hotel from 1881-1891, known as the Tampa Bay Hotel.  So, the museum's collection came from that period.  The exterior look of the building is still intact today with these unique Islamic minarets.  There are some beautiful decors remaining inside the building as well.  It's worth to take a look."
__label__5	My favorite fried chicken! Great roasted vegetables and gravy! Banana pudding is a must try too!! Salmon salad is wonderful too!
__label__5	This New Orleans institution is easily my favorite poboy joint in the city.  I almost always order a caprese poboy w/out the balsamic vinegar and an order of debris fries.
__label__5	Dr. McConnell is absolutely amazing. I took my miniature golden doodle in because she was throwing up blood and this place took amazing care of her. I highly recommend! Dr. McConnell is an excellent communicator and does a good job of reassuring and supporting. The staff is caring. I had to sit out in the parking lot due to the virus but they would call me every 30 to 60 minutes to give me an update on what was going on with my sweet dog.
__label__5	I've been here so many times and it still remains one of my favorite places to go to for dinner. They have amazing Korean fusion food that's not too pricey and feels upscale. My absolute favorite is the bulgolgi pasta - a psuedo Italian dish with bulgogi beef in it. It's super rich and delicious and puts me in a food coma every time. Everything on the menu is really good though, so you really can't go wrong. The people who work and own the place are nice and helpful, so definitely come out and support this local business!
__label__5	This place is wonderful! The food was delicious, the portions were excellent and you could even share a single order. I got the three cheese ravioli and it was amazing, and tagliatelle was even better. Highly recommend!
__label__5	We stayed in the spa suite. Expensive, but worth it! The jacuzzi tub, and the steam shower was amazing!
__label__5	This place saved our gluten free butts in New Orleans.  We went a few times during vacation and we'll go back again when we're back in town.  Great selection, awesome salsa, delicious table side guacamole, and pineapple cilantro margaritas to die for.  The sampler platter and the filet tacos are amazing!!!
__label__5	"Oh my god I love this place.  Ever time I am in New Orleans I stop at ""Pat O'Brien's"".  Such a fun place to with friends.  The drinks are awesome and you get to keep the glass.  I had the hurricanes.  :)

The food is not half bad either.  I would definitely recommend this place if your in a city y that has one."
__label__5	Redicululously good tour!  Dee showed up promptly on time along with her boyfriend, and guide, Sandy for the official launch...  Both are very charming and professional...  Sandy drove us around for the day, 6 of us in all, and we couldn't be happier.  In a nutshell, Sandy is the perfect host and guide - knowledgable, hospitable and an overall awesome character!  His ability to connect with the group was exceptional.  This tour won't disappoint you!  Definitely well worth it, all around.
__label__5	This place was excellent and the service was great too. My husband has a shellfish allergy and our server was on point in keeping him alive. We will be back to try those chicken and waffles
__label__5	Great addition to the Ybor food scene     The menu items are all presented beautifully and the flavor is fantastic.  Highly recommend
__label__5	Top notch venue and iconic building in the Indy skyline.  I have been to Lucas Oil for concerts, sporting events, and even dinner parties!  This modern facility has every sort of amenity that you could want! Retractable roof, lots of space to walk around and talk, and lots of food and drink options. While known as the home of the Colts football team, this facility is flexible and can host a wide variety of events.  My personal favorite was a One Direction concert held on the field that I will never forget. If you ever get the opportunity to visit, jump on it!
__label__5	Defiantly worth the visit, get the homemade water.  I got the best Menudo in the north east!
__label__5	I work behind Prep & Pastry and came over for an early lunch. Even though it was before lunch hrs began they were happy to accommodate. The Prep Burger was amazing and well worth the price!
__label__5	If you live in Tampa and you're not a regular here yet, then you're just missing out on life. This is the best little sandwich shop ever. You won't find any boring sandwiches here; everything is so fresh and delicious. I highly recommend the Crunchy Chicken and the Chipotle Grilled Chicken. Their breakfast bowls are also amazing. Don't forget to get a free sample of their Jalapeno Bacon Hush Puppies on your first visit.
__label__5	One of my favorite ethnic food places in Nashville. The food is amazing and well priced. It is our favorite Mediterranean place.  The owner is a super nice guy and all of the waiters are great as well. Cannot say enough nice things.  Just go and check it out. You will not regret it.
__label__5	Went in to get some food to take home after work... ordered from the bartender... he was super busy but on top of it!! Friendly and quick. I have actually been to this location a few times... Billy and Chris S. Are the best and most friendly!!! Food was awesome service is always great. One of my favorites in my area.
__label__5	I'm so happy I found this place! I love the ambience in the restaurant and although it's quite snug it fit the overall atmosphere. The food is absolutely delicious. I loved every dish that was ordered especially the ravioli, cheese plate (the truffle honey was to die for), beef carpaccio, and kale salad. I really loved that our table felt like a private room and accommodated our party of 6. Will definitely be back again!
__label__5	This is a wonderful establishment. My waitress Bonnie was the sweetest and she made the dining experience so good!! Me and my family will definitely be returning. Really good boneless wings too.
__label__5	"A cafe is super cute!  Menu is small but mighty, coffee is delish, and they even serve mimosas! Perfect for a light brunch and getting some work done! 

The look and feel is light, airy and modern! 

A tiny bit small so I would feel bad about staying for an extended amount time...but still a great place to get an hours of work in while enjoying coffee and mimosas!"
__label__5	So over ordered, but still finished it all. It was that good. Great food and flavors.
__label__5	Beautiful and relaxing nail salon that prioritizes CLEAN above all else. They have a clean space, with clean tools, and they use nail polish with clean ingredients. I trust them and their service is top-notch, offering a glass of bubbly with each visit.
__label__5	This place has dining in now along with carry out...the buffet isn't open but Jim cooks to order...it's like you have your own chef...which makes the food even better and fresher....I suggest u come often great place come check it out
__label__5	Amazing!  Get the ocean sauce and you won't go wrong. I'd eat a shoe with that sauce- it's that phenomenal.  The canneloni appetizer was huge enough to be a meal. Great authentic food
__label__5	Stop there every friday to pick up my dogs favorite treats that only walmart sells , and my favorite beverages at a good prive.
__label__5	I love this place. They're service is upbeat and extremely inviting. They make me feel like I'm home & they're tidewater boba tea is off the chain. Two thumbs up !
__label__5	When we arrived they were already closing, but still took the order and did it very quickly. Very kind service and tasty big portions of food for a very good price!
__label__5	Just went to Blue Corn for the first time and it's safe to say that any hype you may have heard is totally true. Service was great and every single thing we ordered was delicious. Even the chips and salsa that are free with the meal were the best I've ever had. Go. Eat tacos. Drink margaritas.  And be merry.
__label__5	This salon gives the best service you could ever ask for! I had Phyllis and Jenny for my facials and they always do an amazing job. It's the most relaxing time and I always look forward to coming. On top of that, the products they recommended for me leaves my skin glowing and feeling flawless. I will forever be a client here!!! Go book your facials with them. You will not regret it.
__label__5	I booked a last minute massage and it was amazing! Fantastic hospitality and Greg was very professional and one of the best massages I've ever had. Prices are reasonable at 90 minutes for $105. I can't wait to go back!
__label__5	This place is a hidden gem!    The best Italian food ever!   I love coming here for a quick slice of pizza or a more extensive dinner date.  The daily selections are always fresh and wonderful.  My favorites include sea food and are large enough to share or have left overs. If you want to get tighter with friends meet here and sit together in the back room.   Wine and beer also available.
__label__5	Our pup had an accident in the house that was subsequently stepped in and tracked around the house. I called and spoke to Mark who said they could get to us in 20 minutes as they had just finished a job! They were at our address in 20 minutes and had the 3 rooms cleaned in less than an hour while doing a great job on our carpet and tile. I recommend them to anyone in Reno. Very friendly and knowledgeable too.
__label__5	Annika did an amazing job. First gel manicure lasted 7 weeks! And she's very helpful in ensuring you get just the color you are hoping for. Would highly recommend.
__label__5	"Love love love the sushi at Tokyo Grill. So fresh, so tasty. Wish they had delivery or used the Waitr app though. 
Pricing for sushi is the best around."
__label__5	Great food!  Nice place!  Friendly staff!  We like to take out-of-town guests here.  They have a large menu and the food is always consistent.  Need to make reservations.
__label__5	Very affordable filling option for a meal.  Noodles were fresh and well prepared.  I ordered a shrimp noodle bowl and appreciated that it came with 5 decent sized shrimp, a real good value.
__label__5	What a delicious and exciting experience! The lunch crowd will rock you. Vibrant atmosphere. Cashier holding two phones. People dining in. Others order to-go. It was fun enjoying my sandwich while watching the crowd turn over and over as it was controlled by shouts from behind the counter. CASH ONLY. The bun of my sandwich was boss! Gotta be one of the best Philly Cheesesteak sandwiches in the galaxy. Always had a full Cherry Coke in my glass. Thank you, Delessandro's!
__label__5	I could not be happier with the level of service I received.  Dropped my car off Monday and got it back on Tuesday. They went above and beyond.  They even fixed a part that was not part of the agreement,  Would o back in a heart beat.
__label__5	First time here , got the spicy chicken and its very good very close to the stone oven subs ,clen place and nice ppl
__label__5	I love Hugos. Its so simple its fantastic. The owners are the sweetest people in the world. Food is good....a mesh of coffee shop with a kick of asian homestyle. Breakfast and lunch served all day. Great little short order gems: I suggest the spicy chicken bowl with brown rice and the eggs Benedict! Great for the lunch break!
__label__5	My boyfriend and I shared the strawberry banana crepe and very delicious! I'm from Japan and this is pretty close to the real thing! Super fresh and tasty! Can't wait to go back and try some of the savory crepes they offer
__label__5	Best place to stop for breakfast / lunch in the city, regardless of if you are a tourist or local.
__label__5	"Jyoti did the henna for our wedding this past March. 

From the beginning she was wonderful to work with. Always responsive, she travelled to Mt. Laurel, NJ for our henna event, created amazing designs for the guests and bride, and was even willing to charge less than our agreed to price since less time was required (a very honest person).

We strongly recommend her to anyone looking for henna (wedding or otherwise)"
__label__5	The employees here are always super welcoming and kind! The inside is very laid-back and clean. I tried the blueberry muffin and the chocolate one and they were both delicious.
__label__5	So freaking good. Such a great idea! The tomato basil couldn't have been better, and the mac daddy didn't disappoint one bit.  Anytime I'm in the area, I'll be stopping here and telling others about it.
__label__5	I've been 4 times and it has been amazing every single time! All the sandwiches are unique with great flavor combos! Def one of the best sandwich places in STL.
__label__5	It's been a while since I've been to this location. Today I had the pleasure of meeting Troy. He navigated through the check-in process seamlessly. There is a level of customer service hear that the dealerships could take some cues from. I have been a customer of Tires Plus for over 10 years and stopped in many of them across the country. They always do a great job.
__label__5	Best place in town for old school candy, ice cream, and nostalgia. Conveniently located and parking right in front. Prices are reasonable and staff is very friendly.
__label__5	Had an amazing experience at The Social. All the food was phenomenal! Had wings and French Toast. My server was Tony and he was great! The manager even walked us to the Roof Top!!! Had a wonderful birthday experience.  Will definitely be back.
__label__5	Let me start by saying Javier is an amazing waiter who knows how to treat his guests! This is our second time here and the food doesn't disappoint! We had the pork and chili verde and the steak ala mexicana both were full of flavor and more than enough food. Don't forget to order a margarita we had the pineapple and it was full of fresh pineapple and tequila!! We will be back and bringing all of our friends too!
__label__5	I was very sceptical after reading about things that have happened to people using a moving company. But I have to say, my salesman Daniel handled our move with the utmost professionalism. He took the time to make sure we understood our whole move every step of the way.
__label__5	We enjoyed some yesterday , They went above and beyond to help us with our cake desires , Cake was amazing , service was Amazing , we will be stopping by most every time we are close , easy access on and off 80 plenty of room to park large or small vehicles, awesome time , Thank you
__label__5	I drive from central Boise to have my nails done there.  It's so worth the drive.  My nails never lift, everyone is friendly and professional, and the salon is very clean.
__label__5	"Simply delighted to find this quaint little cafe across from the Missouri River and a very short drive from my Hotel. Only wish I had more time to rent a bike and see if the adjacent riverfront trail route actually is 300 miles long!

Instead, I settled for a wonderful latte, bowl of tomato soup, and ""Humma Hummas"" sandwich, which a lovely, lavender-haired pixie served outside next to a cozy fire where fellow diners cheerfully chatted away with a stranger from Houston."
__label__5	It's my second time drinking at this location. Always a great place to be if you prefer to enjoy a nice dark ambience. Servers and bartenders know their concoction(S), it's not overly crowded like most places. I highly recommend this bar :).
__label__5	Recently moved to Kenner and I'm very impressed with Flavors. They are inexpensive and the snowball ice is super soft like I love it! I tell everyone I talk to to visit Flavors!!
__label__5	This is a quick, but healthy option for fast food when you are busy.  I know it's a commercial restaurant and there are other options in New Orleans, but it's convenient. My go to is the steak or shrimp kabobs with a Greek salad.  The lamb pita is tasty as well.
__label__5	"I have had pizza from this location several times. tonight was the best pizza ever, from anywhere !

l ordered online;  no cheese, with tomatoes, onions, peppers and spinach. It was pizza from the gods. I might relive this pizza in my mind for a few years, it was that good."
__label__5	I love this place! Super friendly owner and staff, ice cream is awesome and all made in house! Go now! You'll be glad you did!
__label__5	"Oh man, who cares about the pizza?

THE BEER! This selection is absolutely amazing. I mean, that's actually the only reason we went to this location in the first place. I mean, the most randomly incredible selection of beer I've ever seen. This will always be my go to!

Apparently the pizza is actually pretty good too though..."
__label__5	"Fun atmosphere and great bar food. 
Literally something for everyone. If you like good comfort food with a unique twist go for their mac & cheese skillet, onion rings or PBJ wings. All were excellent. 
The staff is friendly and the music will make you want to get up and dance."
__label__5	Love Dr.Mcmurry he makes my dentist trips quick and painless. Highly recommended and his staff is amazing too so helpful. Mcmurry explains ever procedure step by step till I understand it completely and so I'm comfortable with what's going on.
__label__5	"Came in here for something sweet and ended up getting there turtle carmel apple.  Big enough to share with my husband.  They cut it up for you and put in a special container just for the apples.  It was really good, just the right amount of sweet from both the chocolate and the carmel, and the granny Smith was good also.  Loved the amount of peanuts on it. 

Will be back here for sure to try there ice cream and some fudge next time we our in town when it's a tad bit warmer."
__label__5	"We came in for an early dinner on Wednesday April 24th.  Had a great 8 oz. filet and my wife had seared tuna.  We shared creamed spinach.  Our desserts of butter cake and cheese cake were great suggestions.  We had a bottle of Luke Cabernet Sauvignon which was a server suggestion

All were very good and we would order them again.  Service by Gabriell was excellent.  Her great attitude and knowledge of the wines we were interested in was very good."
__label__5	"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! 
I bought an online special that included a 50-minute massage and 50-minute facial and I thoroughly enjoyed both. Linda was phenomenal and had me so relaxed and made me feel so comfortable and pampered. I can't wait to go back and see Linda for another massage and/or facial!

The Salon & Spa overall is so clean and cozy and everyone is friendly and accommodating. I'm sad it took me this long to find this gem of a place!"
__label__5	This place was Amazing. Best hot-pot I have had in Philly for sure. I was a little skeptical of the no sauces idea but the broth was actually so dang good I didn't need any! My only negative was that their white rice is terrible, no one else in the restaurant seemed to really have ordered in, but I like a good bite of rice now and then between my spicy stuff. But their rice is super bad. But that's not why people go there, so over-all great time.
__label__5	"Just me and my sons for a great lunch after a morning at ""the Fly"" throwing the football and flying kites. We got chargrilled oysters, roast beef poboy, fried shrimp and gumbo, should be called the holy quadruple! Perfect"
__label__5	Seriously the BEST sushi place in Tucson. Reasonable prices for some of the freshest fish and tons of unique roll choices. PLUS, dinner orders (even sushi) include edamame, soup, and scoop of ice cream for dessert!
__label__5	This salon is conveniently located, clean, and super cute. Ali is amazing with blonde hair and making highlights look natural. I highly recommend this place!
__label__5	Always delicious. Love their Thai coconut soup and lettuce wrap. Steamed buns hit the spot as well. I'd give a higher rating if I could!
__label__5	"A great organic, fresh grocery store and cafe. Perfect size for the things you need including a great wine selection. 

I've loved the fresh food section (gluten free Mac & cheese, vegan brownie, chocolate mousse) and the cafe for their shakes (had the shamrock shake). Perfect spot for me to stop in for things I've needed while in town. 

Very nice counter workers at the deli - they seem like they know everyone and were very kind while making my shake. 

Clean, nice, good finds."
__label__5	Great gym.  Was in Indy for 4 days on business and the local hotel gym just did not meet my needs.  Cavin sold me a very reasonable 3-day gym pass, that I could use at any time in my visit to Indy.  I could come and go as I pleased--- and to top off the great customer service, Cavin personally delivered by Access Key to the hotel, so it was there when I checked in.  Talk about service!
__label__5	"Great!!! Excellent!!! Awesome place! I have been here twice and both times the nail technicians were amazing. They are quick, precise and actually seem to care what their clients think. 
And I absolutely love the shoulder massage after."
__label__5	"This place has really fresh sushi. We had the Elvis roll and the protein roll which were recommended to us and both were fresh and good. We tried the blue crab tuna salmons salad with jalapeño sauce which the server recommended. We ordered it thinking it would just be ok but it was DELICIOUS! Will definitely come back! 

There isn't much seating and the place is small so if you're going on weekend or peak hours i would recommend making a reservation."
__label__5	Great experience! Very nice guys and good customer service. They didn't try to push any other services on me. I am definitely going back.
__label__5	The food was delicious. The atmosphere was quiet and beautiful. The service was phenomenal. Rasheed was our waiter and he did a fabulous job. We would highly reccomend this restaurant!
__label__5	Enjoyed the chai, perfectly not too sweet. The pecan pie was delicious two days in a row, as were the sausage biscuit sandwiches -- perfectly flaky. The people are super friendly and the decor lives up to the cozy name. Other folks in our party enjoyed the Turkish coffee and the egg & tomato dish. Highly recommended!
__label__5	Excellent food and service. ALWAYS consistently good. Great value for the price as well. Highly recommend. Had a party there and they couldn't have been any more accommodating.
__label__5	Without a doubt the best Chinese restaurant in doylstown.  As a matter of fact it is almost the equivalent of Chinese restaurants that I have eaten in New York and San Francisco.
__label__5	I walked in 10 minutes before close. The staff were cheerful and helpful and accommodating! Great experience.
__label__5	"I had the most amazing vegan Caribbean food at Veggie Village. The owner and chef, Gail and Chef ""Ridiculous"" Troy welcomed me into their home. Literally! This restaurant is in a converted home. Gail themed each room. There are beautiful furnishings and family photos and heirlooms. I had a veggie plate with two sides. So good. Organic. Salt-free.

__label__5	Paul is a great guy, and true professional. We hired him to fix things around the house, as well as to patch up and paint our bathrooms. He was on time, the work looks great, and the project was tidy. I highly recommend Black Rock Handyman for your projects.
__label__5	Always enjoy it here, half priced whisky on Wednesdays and really tasty food. Good service and nice decor
__label__5	How have I overlooked this restaurant while living in the area for 10+ years?  Took advantage of restaurant week to expand my world.  Beautiful restaurant with small bar at entrance.  No wait long at bar as the reservation was honored at the requested time.  Attentive service without being intrusive.  Each of the dishes were executed very well and presented perfectly at the right time.  Veal dish was tender and flavorful.   The wine list is huge as are the wine cellars in the basement.  La Famiglia is now on my top 10 in Philly list.
__label__5	I love this place. They are family owned. The food os always fresh and they are friendly
__label__5	"I ordered take out for the first time from HIFalutin and was very happy with my meal.  I will admit that I had low expectations- who orders a steak for take out? Everything was great. The baked potato perfectly cooked and the ribeye was delicious. My order was on time and professionally packed up.
my order also came with corn blueberry muffins- delicious!"
__label__5	"Joey is one of the most intelligent, empathetic, and intuitive people I have ever met. He has changed my life, and resolved every single issue I have brought to him. He's fixed things I didn't even know I was struggling with. 

He's one of those people that just sees right through you; to who you really are and what you really need. Hands down, the best practitioner I have seen in any field. His sense of humor and kind heart are just the cherry on top!"
__label__5	Robyn is an amazing stylist who is friendly and courteous.  She's great at small talk and takes her time to do the job right. I found my new regular barber and will continue to give her and FishHawk Barbershop my business.
__label__5	"Clean, professional, great valet parking, great breakfast at Hotel.
Do not go for a drink at Sobro Sports bar unless you want to pay $15.25 for a Scotch or $8 for house wine. Highest beverage prices in Nashville. Now I realize why there was only three people in the place. Go to Pinewood Social on Peabody St. if you want a beverage at fair prices with a relaxed atmosphere."
__label__5	This is a cute clean place, great customer service, great coffee we enjoyed toasted bagels sandwiches and pastries
__label__5	Went to this buffet for seafood night.  Absolutely amazing.  Will definitely be going back. May never go to another buffet.  The food was great,  the prices were great and the service was great. Crepes are amazing.
__label__5	Went there to get pumpkins and was pleasantly surprised that their pumpkins are not priced per lb. They're priced by which wagon they're on and the most expensive ones were $8.99. The cheaper ones ($5.99) were almost the same exact size as the more expensive ones so you do get a large pumpkin for a good price compared to many other farm stands. Most farm stands have odd shaped pumpkins or small ones that are really overpriced.
__label__5	David was my agent for the sale of my Goleta condo (under $400k).  I found him to be very professional and personable.  He was informative and honest, walking me through each step of the process and keeping me continuously updated.  Many times he went above and beyond what is expected of an agent.  David is the Ritz-Carlton of real estate agents and I highly recommend him.
__label__5	Excellent service. Professional, curious and thorough. I highly recommend them! I had a problem with ghost ants that no one else could resolve, but they did in one visit.
__label__5	I love this place. Anytime I'm in the city I make a stop.  Good prices and great food.
__label__5	I've been here a couple of times, decor is meh...always good service and value.  Came tonight and ordered the Grilled Cheese Cubano. Sweet mother of Jesus was it good and HUGE!  Well done Nelson, this is not the julienne strip of pork in a breadwich. My GF got the Pork Tomahawk....awesome.  Our server Alex was super sweet, very attentive and overall awesome. We will be back sooner based on our overall experience tonight.
__label__5	Just relocated to the area and found the perfect nail spot! Beautiful nail salon, very clean and the staff was very friendly! Dee did an amazing job with my nails! Love the ombré!
__label__5	This was a very large thrift store. It was very very organized and it was easy to find different things. They have multiple sales depending on the day of the week. Their website has a lot of information. The items were used but not really junky.  They had a great selection of furniture and home decor as well as clothes.
__label__5	"Delicious !   Highly recommend for atmosphere, food /wine and service.   

Hope you visit them and have an excellent experience too.  I'm sure we'll be back with friends!

Thank you Amber (at Tampa Airport), Dave, Audrey, and both our awesome servers on 10/8/14 !  

Jackie & Jim"
__label__5	"A huge thank you to Forest, Megan, and Jenny for making our stay at the Arizona Inn one of the most memorable experiences. As a Chef, I know the hospitality industry well, and I confidently say that the staff at Arizona Inn knows how to make their guests feel special. 

Thank you again !"
__label__5	Best BBQ in Tampa! Brisket is amazing and you get 6 sandwiches beef,pork,chicken or sausage for 10 bucks can't be beat baby!
__label__5	Always hits the spot, their burritos and nachos are our go-to's. Their horchata and hibiscus drinks are great too!
__label__5	Kayla was awesome she let me charge my electric bike and was super friendly early in the morning love this place
__label__5	My husband and I came here for lunch. We got a gluten free pizza with pepperoni and bacon.  We loved it.  We can never get really great gluten free pizza back home but this pizza was the best gluten free pizza we have had.  And everyone there was so nice.  We will definitely be back!
__label__5	Brandy is super talented and really looks out for your best interests even when you are not around. While my wife and I were waiting for guests to arrive to walk down the isle Brandy used some of her personal flowers that she had on hand to fix the dead ones that another vendor had set up. Our flowers were one of the best highlights of our day. I would recommend her to anyone!
__label__5	Great food and atmosphere, bring a coat its extremely  cold in there! Love the burgers, chicken and fries
__label__5	"My wife and I try to visit new places to eat on a regular basis, not sure why it took us so long to try this place but I'm sure glad we did. 

We were surprised by the ambiance, very nice, was not expecting it. The service could not have been any better and the food was superb. 

I had the fried chicken and my wife had the salmon both were delicious. We will definitely keep this place on our short list from now on!"
__label__5	The food was great the service was excellent .I had forgotten how good this place was. The chicken wings were amazing
__label__5	"I had excellent experience with this company.  Approx. 24hours prior to the appointment, I got a call, confirming the upcoming visit.  Angel H&C tech arrived on time, as agreed.   All work was completed as promised.   

I would highly recommend Angel Heating & Cooling to anyone looking for a well experienced and reliable HVAC business."
__label__5	Sonny's has always been one of preferred bbq stops, but tonight they solidified their self as one of our FAVORITES! They've always had great food and good service, but they truly went above and beyond. My husband ordered one of their burgers, but they apparently did not have any burgers left. They actually had some burgers delivered from a nearby Sonny's and made it for him AND they comped it! Hard to believe that this kind of customer service still exists. GREAT PLACE! GREAT FOOD! GREAT PEOPLE!
__label__5	This was our first time here. We originally came to eat at another restaurant near by but it was full so we came here. To my surprise this place was great! They even have a full bar!! The Food, The Service, The drinks!! Just a chill little spot with really good wood fired pizza! I can't wait to try the rest of the menu, especially their desserts and the coffee. Try it, you won't regret it!
__label__5	Great sandwiches made to order, every sandwich is custom made to your desires. Absolutely destroys any other sandwich shop with fresh ingredients and fast service. Great value for the quality.
__label__5	Was just in Nashville for a girls weekend, a friend who had just been in town recommended Joyride and it was awesome! Super convenient and quick every time we called. Patrick was awesome, he knew a lot about the city and had great suggestions. We'll definitely be calling again next time we're in town!
__label__5	"I started seeing Marci after an auto accident 26 years ago.  At the time, I was also training regularly in martial arts and experiencing extreme pain during and after my workouts.  With monthly deep tissue massages, I was able to continue to train and my pain greatly diminished (and eventually went away).  Twenty-six years later, I continue to see Marci and her ""healing hands"" keep me feeling well and flexible.  Even though I'm much older, I can continue to do various workouts.  Marci has several other qualified masseuses at the studio."
__label__5	Awesome local bar. Food is great. Crowd is chill. Really cool ambiance. Seafood and Italian food is great.
__label__5	So cleannnnn in here! Their produce looks like the garden of eden! I love it! Ordered one of their legendary subs here as well and it was perfect!
__label__5	My husband and I make a trip here every time we are in Ventura or Santa Barbara and are never disappointed. They truly have the best ice cream.
__label__5	Amazing customer service at the front desk! Gives you phone call updates to check with you, if you would like to make repairs after getting an examination completed. Very reasonable price to repair my A/C, and the examination price goes right into the repairs if you purchase them, so you save money there too! Cold blowing A/C right in time for the summer! (Would recommend to friends)
__label__5	"Their cooking is delicious and is the closest I've had to the real deal out of the region. I can't recommend it any higher because there are only five stars to check. 

The baba ganush is heavenly, smoky, and simply freaking unreal. The kabobs and sauces are all awesome. I've never had a mediocre here for lunch or dinner. 

While busy nights may take a while to prepare, the food is freshly cooked.  And, a leisurely meal provides time to digest and speak with the family.  A welcome change to rushing and quickness over quality."
__label__5	My husband and I vacationed here for our honeymoon.  We had the best 3 nights rest after hectic times with the wedding.  The bed was amazingly comfortable and I loved the little lavender sachets on our pillow.  The bathroom was clean with a wonderful shower stall.  I couldn't wait to take a shower each time.  The staff were courteous and helpful.  It's a nice short walk from the beach and my husband and I actually walked a little further to popular State Street on two occasions.
__label__5	"Amazing experience. A small comfortable atmosphere with perfect friendly service. The Gyros were so tender they fell apart in your mouth! Must try! 

#HappyBRipResident"
__label__5	I love going to this place. I wish it was closer, since it's pretty out of the way for me (: Everything I have tried there has been fresh and yummy. The best boba place I've been to in idaho so far!
__label__5	"Favorite sandwich spot in Santa Barbara.

Robert Emmet, Roast Beef Hottie '88, Turkey Gorgonzola Salad are just a few of my favorites.

The sandwiches and salads are always awesome, and the staff is super friendly."
__label__5	I have been going to Dr. Pascarella  for several years now. He gives a very thorough eye exam, and is very kind and listens to you to address any concerns or problems, he has been excellent in helping me find the right contact lenses for my sensitive eyes. Staff is also very kind and knowledgable. I highly recommend this practice for eye care.
__label__5	The Philly Cheesesteak. Don't bother with provolone, whiz it!
__label__5	Just awesome for lunch.   Sushi awesome.   Tempura awesome.  Just  go. Some of the best Japanese food I've had anywhere.
__label__5	Great batting cages! All levels of pitching. Great for dates or to get your frustration out! Reasonable pricing too! Only batting cages in Philly.
__label__5	"One of our favorites!
Food is always great-try the Mexican food, its awesome!  The salads are also very good and so is the soup. (Tortilla or French Onion are my 2 favorites)
If you get one of the pastas there is way to much food and always have leftovers.
Oh, the mango Iced tea is great!"
__label__5	Every year I celebrate my birthday at Devon's.  The food, ambiance and service are excellent!  I highly recommend the restaurant to anyone.
__label__5	"My son was hungry after his soccer game and looked up places to eat. He pointed this place outs 'twas 3 minutes from where we played.  
Excellent flavor. Large portions. Friendly staff. Pleasant background music. The place doesn't look like much from the outside but the food is amazing! Definitely recommend this place and next time we are in the area, we'll be back. 
He left full and happy!"
__label__5	"My wife and I travel the country enjoying sights, people, and food.  Our travels this summer brought us to Meridian UT and Epi's.  From the greeting by Chris the wonderfully gracious owner to the final sip of coffee after consuming every bite of my flana everything was superb!!  The Butterfish special paired perfectly with the Albariño.  The quality of ingredients paired perfectly with the chef's steady hands.  As we continue our journey we will seek reason to put Epi's on our ""must return"" list."
__label__5	Since moving to the area from NJ, I am so glad to have found this place! I love the food here. Service is very friendly and inviting!  It's become our favorite spot on Saturday mornings!
__label__5	WOW I came with Cameron and all I can say is WOW!!! Southern starts off with a perfectly fried piece of chicken then it's up to you how much heat you desire. They start off with the original just simply fried. Then from there they start with a delicate blend of cayenne and other peppers 4 levels up to the in your face cluckin hot (which I had) they then dip the chicken in the flavor pool to add to the experience. If you like fried chicken you're gonna love this place.
__label__5	Delicious creamy homemade ice cream.  Offers inside and outside service.  Friendly staff and nice selection of flavors.  They also offer soft served ice cream and gelato.
__label__5	I highly recommend this place to anyone who is seeking a good pet groomer. They are always friendly, they do a fantastic job on my miniature American Eskimo. They even do courtesy phone calls to remind you that it's close to the time for your next  pet grooming, based on how often you have previously brought you pet in.
__label__5	"I love this place, so does my daughter. Despite its small size, we never fail to find something we want to read, and the folks running it are so friendly! 

I picked out some books before vacation but had forgotten my wallet. I returned after closing and they'd saved them for me and stayed open while I finished my selections and paid. Good conversation too."
__label__5	Had a really good breakfast with reasonable prices.
__label__5	Service was good. Food was great! They very obviously cared about the experience we were having and made sure everything was to our liking. I was saying how much I love samosas and as I was leaving they handed me complimentary samosas to go. I visited with a group of colleagues from work and we will be coming back and ordering from here again. And again. :)
__label__5	This is, if not The Best, one of the best hotels in the world.  Their hospitality is exceptional from Doorman to Front Desk and most importantly from Housekeeping.  I get written notes from Housekeeping every time I get home at night.  Then they went beyond exceptional.  I was surprised when a wine and mixed nuts were sent to me from my Housekeeper.  You will not only enjoy the service but the hotel itself because it feels like home.
__label__5	Fantastic place for a burger.   I'm not s burger person but this was the best I have had.   Ordered a single with cheese and onion rings.   Heaven!   They have a mayo bar with all hand made mayos about 6 versions from chipotle to basil.   Highly recommend !
__label__5	"This place will make you forget about Subway and Publix subs after your first bite. I got the Roly Poly which is the best meatball sub I've ever had.

Fresh is always better, and it doesn't get any fresher than this place. Fresh mozzarella, fresh meat sauce, and fresh homemade meatballs. And you can taste the difference, it's amazing.

If I have any need for Italian food I am going to check here first."
__label__5	This museum is a collection of all things medical. There are two floors and it's usually really crowded inside. You're not allowed to take in bags or take pictures. If you're squeamish, this probably isn't the best place to visit. It's graphic, gross, educational, and the kind of weird where you can't stop looking even though you also really kind of want to stop looking.
__label__5	heaven. i have my own vegan pizza spots back home so i usually get something else like the cheese fries or cheeses steak but they never disappoint. i would move to philly for blackbird.
__label__5	One of my favorite places to eat in Indy! Food, atmosphere, and staff are all exceptional!
__label__5	we had yellow chicken curry and pad thai.  my boyfriend and i liked it and we will come back.  the service was good too.
__label__5	Excellent vet, Dr. Hughes is a quirky but talented in his field. This guy really cares about the animals and has been able to spot on diagnose where others have not been able to. He only does what's necessary and doesn't try to up charge you. Also, I believe he is a pioneer in doing successful organ transplants. Need I really say more?
__label__5	"Absolutely in love with this little mexican food truck. Right next to mister hot shine car wash, it's a little hard to find via GPS but look up either that or pancake house. 
The lady who works there was way too adorable. And her cooking was supreme. I'll be honest, I'm not the best judge to say what's authentic but dang it was AMAZING. I would suggest the chicken burrito. Plus the sauce was homemade, pure flavour. 
You gotta stop by sometime! You'll day will be made."
__label__5	These guys are fantastic.  I was rear ended in a parking lot and was told by Dent Pro that it could not be fixed unless I took it into an expensive repair shop.  When I called Dents and Dings Nick came out and said it can be fixed.  Might not be perfect but it would look much better.  Well, it is a near perfect fix and I am very pleased.  The price was reasonable too!!!  I highly recommend Dents and Dings
__label__5	Stopped by after golf. Awesome service, rib tips on special, jerk tips were great, baked beans were the best!
__label__5	This place is great and Gabby is amazing! I came in with a vision and she made it happen.
__label__5	"Great dinning experience. The whole staff was amazing and our waiter Brett took extra great care of us. From cocktails to desert our time and money was well spent.
My husband and myself had the Chateau for two and it was excellent. Probably one of the best steaks I have every had. Don't for get the chocolate mousse for desert!!!"
__label__5	This place is a hidden gem.  Phenomenal food matched with an intimate atmosphere.  The grilled chicken and rice is amazing.
__label__5	I cannot say enough good things about this place.  Chris Fowle is a wonderful guy who'll always make sure you're taken care of.  His staff, Donny, Adam, and Wallie are well trained and I trust them completely with all of my vehicles.  I will never use another mechanic.
__label__5	"Cheryl( especially YOU!) , April and Brandy ( I think I spelled their names right) are such nice and professional Ladies! I felt so at home. It was like being on the Oprah Winfrey show. They are so sweet that you'll share your entire life with them! Thank you and  the Dr. Win for being so nice and prompt. It was a pleasure meeting you all and I'm looking forward to being one of your patients.

Thanks,

Wil"
__label__5	Was recommended to try Jims by some locals and I was very satisfied! So much flavor and wasn't dry at all! Had the cheese steak whiz wit (best way to have the Cheesesteak in my opinion). Waited no longer than 10 min and that was very impressive as the order before me was $210 worth of Cheesesteaks and hoagies! Employees are extremely efficient. Cash only place.
__label__5	We got married a month ago in Jackson Square with just a few friends and our parents. We wanted to keep it simple and easy so we found Kathleen. She made everything simple, was responsive and helpful with each and every question I sent her. She was great about getting the pictures to us quickly and flexible with how she sent them (we opted for a USB and she sent it via Dropbox too). And when I got the pictures and was missing one or two, she was quick to find them and add them to the rest of the pictures. Definitely a great choice! We highly recommend her!
__label__5	Last September I was struggling with trying to lose weight. I needed kick start and lifestyle change. I wanted to feel like I was part of a community vs. just going to a gym.  I stumbled upon Unite and it was everything I wanted and more! The work out are SO fun and challenging.. but in a good way! I love that you are always surprised, never have the same work out. Since the trainers aways mix it up I have seen results! I also have met with Juliet for nutritional counseling - that is what really jump started my results!
__label__5	This is the third time eating at Gennaros and I haven't been disappointed once. The food is excellent. The owners are so friendly. The menu covers all types of  eaters, vegetarian, meat eaters, pescatarians, you needn't worry about pleasing everyone. Thanks for a great restaurant.
__label__5	Exciting atmosphere, fresh and delightful dishes, courteous waitstaff and an outstanding wine list.  Kudos to waiter Chris!
__label__5	Cozy place with super friendly staff and the best coffee in Reno. The Caramella is my fav. Full disclosure-the morning staff makes a better coffee than the afternoon peeps.
__label__5	I finally have the hair color that I wanted. I had been to many other salons but no success. The only bad thing is the parking.
__label__5	Tourists looking for dinner between New Orleans & Baton Rouge - what a score! Happy Hour drinks were 50% off. The shrimp & grits were a pleasant surprise. Would definitely recommend!
__label__5	Excellent Easter brunch with plenty of food & attentive service.  Ordered eggs benedict at the omlet station & it was brought too the table hot & delicious.
__label__5	"Ate here last night whilst on a snowboarding trip and was deeply impressed with everything about this quirky little restaurant.
Chef Maurice made us very welcome and the food was excellent. Can heartily recommend the vegetarian starter which was outstanding and included the BEST falafel we'd ever tasted! Everything was authentically Mediterranean and lots of it, even took some baklava home which was delicious. We'll definitely be back next trip, highly recommended!"
__label__5	Boise brewing is awesome! We tried the whole sampling of beers and they are all really tasty. We loved the atmosphere, staff and the design of the place. The mugs on the wall are cool as well! It's great to have such a rooted, community supported brewery in Boise!
__label__5	This is my favourite place to get a Taiwanese treat!!! Love the green cap tea, the strawberrie toast and of course the taiwanese pancakes my favorites!!! And thia location is a lot nicer that their last location!!! Love tha place the way it make u feel confy but looks really nice!!! The owners are super nice people and I just love going there and is my daughters favorite place!!!
__label__5	Picked up a jar of spicy mango chutney at the fresh market in Hyde Park. It has been a great addition to cheese and charcuterie plates. Also, I added some to my homemade potato salad and it was surprisingly an awesome combination. I look forward to trying other flavors and creating more combinations.
__label__5	Love the breakfast here. You get a lot of food for what you pay and it is yummy too. The pies are great too.
__label__5	"I am SO glad we stopped here. We were traveling through town and turned to trusty Yelp to guide us. It did not disappoint! 

Very cute restaurant where you can watch the pizzas being made through the window! And VERY clean dining tables, floor and bathrooms. 

We were greeted by a friendly hostess and our waiter was SUPER. He was very helpful and attentive and had great recommendations. Food was prompt and hot and so delicious. The crust was really good. The cheese was perfectly melty. The Harvest salad was delicious. 

Highly recommend and would return!"
__label__5	"Visited last weekend for the first time. Great customer service and food. It was BUSY. That's a good thing. If it is not busy, then it is not good. 
We will definitely be returning when we visit Reno again."
__label__5	There is not much to say about this place other than every town should have this local pizza joint, I did not grow up here but I grew up eating pizza from a place like this.  I recommend eating it there or picking up, last night I had a hawaiian and some wings and it was as good as it gets. Thanks again!!
__label__5	It is always a wonder to experience a part of history, first hand. If you have never been on a battleship, you have to experience the size and even then, it is pretty unbelievable.  I am so glad we are keeping important parts of our history for all to see.
__label__5	A super easy and convenient cloth diaper solution! Love that we get the benefits of cloth without the hassle of cleaning. We use both pre-folds and all in ones. Very few leaks/blowouts (mostly when baby was between sizes). Good quality materials that are very clean and the customer service is excellent. Plus, the variety of patterns on the diapers are so adorable!
__label__5	Great service, Great facial, Love the tech Bianca was proffessional clean relaxing an Great knowledge of treatments an products.Will continue to visit an get services done here .Felt good an looked Great.a 5 plus star rrview .AMust to Try.
__label__5	when domino diner burned down four years ago it felt like a family member died. now, at long last, daiva and the crew are back! all i can say is thank god. just had breakfast there this morning and it was excellent. will post another review after trying dinner there. THANK GOD SHE'S BACK!!!
__label__5	The atmosphere and service was fantastic. We did a Birthday celebration and everything was exceptional. Service fantastic and waiter went above and beyond. A photo for memories as well as a glass of champagne!!  The steak was delicious!!  I was actually quite surprised. Would definitely recommend.
__label__5	Just moved to Indy and the fast food experience is very uh...different, than it is in my hometown. I'll be honest the food always tastes good and at this location I've always gotten hot food. But this review is especially won by the young man at the drivethhru 8/16/2020 @ 8:00PM. His energy was so genuine and kind and even though our conversation was short I left feeling like my whole day got better. So nice.
__label__5	"Food and service were both fantastic.  My wife and I shared the alligator bites and blackened shrimp and jambalaya dinner.  The alligator was good but the highlight was the shrimp and jambalaya.  .

Service was great.  Waiter was very attentive and helpful with meal suggestions."
__label__5	Great pizza!!! Just like back home in Brooklyn! Owner is Albanian and Albanians make the BEST pizza world-wide. Take my word for it - don't sell yourself short by not eating here.
__label__5	First time visiting Gents and was very pleased with the way Joe cleaned me up.  Did a great job on my beard too.   Reasonably priced, clean, and very easy making online appointments.  I'd make the 45 minute drive into philly for a good clean up again.   Place is busy but Joe was doing a good job multitasking.
__label__5	I've traveled all over Germany, and this food is authentic.  Atmosphere takes me back to beer houses in Bavaria.  You can't miss with this.  Excellent fare, reasonably priced, music and entertainment added to the experience.  Not a place to have a quiet conversation during a meal, but if you want to celebrate and have fun with very good food, this is the place.
__label__5	Great place! We went on a Tuesday late morning and we were immediately seated. The menu offered a few different categories but we ordered the chicken and waffles, omelet, and king cake French toast. All were amazing! Yes I am a tourist so the king cake appealed to me but it was so yummy I didn't care! I would recommend to anyone who has a sweet tooth! It was also affordable for the amount of food you get.
__label__5	Cool saloon vibe with beverages on tap. A little on the pricey side, but the nitro brew was worth it!
__label__5	Gumbo was the best I have had. The line was long but that is a good sign and the line moved fast. It was raining outside and a nice warm bowl of Gumbo hit the spot. Super cool environment, great food, and a great experience to eat some real New Orleans food .
__label__5	Family friendly brewery that offers kids activity packs, plenty of turf space space to run around and free watermelon for the little ones. Everyone who works there is so friendly and welcoming, and we love that it's a veteran owned business. Steady crowd with a mix of ages - live music and a full menu too. Inside has a nice classic pub feel.
__label__5	I've had the best and tastiest falafel here since moving to Florida over a year ago. Will definitely be back!
__label__5	Allen is a true professional, great at communicating.  Seems very knowledgeable with everything he does and is great with kids.  He tried very hard to get the dolphins to follow the boat.  You won't be disappointed with his services.
__label__5	"This is the place to have an awesome dinner, affordable prices with great staff.
Very nice setting in Carrollwood location.
Check it out.
$10 coupon on FB.
See you there!

Ask for Anthony,"
__label__5	the family environment is amazing and the food is excellent. the prices are good too!
__label__5	Great food here! Very clean and friendly atmosphere! Nothing better than great soup on a chilly day!
__label__5	Fantastic food and awesome service. Unique to Tucson and a welcome exception to the breakfast tedium. Best coffee in town!
__label__5	I just unabashedly shoveled two pupusas into my face in a park full of people... Those pupusas were on point! Definitely going back to try their other offerings. Also who ever took my order was a delightful human being!
__label__5	I visited Bella Body Medical Spa for a massage last week after receiving a gift certificate for my birthday.  The staff was incredibly helpful and extremely nice.  The space is very impressive including separate VIP Gentlemen's and Ladies rooms while awaiting your service.  The massage from Emily was fantastic, one of the best I've received.  I look forward to scheduling my next appointment!
__label__5	I was recommended by multiple people to come here. That had to be one of the most relaxing and wonderful experiences I've ever had. Great people working there along with a great environment.
__label__5	We found this restaurant on yelp and it did not disappoint! We have now visited twice. The service was A+ and the food was wonderful!!! The prices were just as pleasing. I had the chicken Gyro meal with Black Beans and Rice. My husband had the 20 wings and fries! Yum!!! All of there sauces are homemade and the flavor is just wonderful! They also had a variety of deserts that were equally delicious. We'll be back for sure!
__label__5	Green Locus is one of the best yoga studio that I had been to... The studio is very clean and creates a calming atmosphere shedding the stressors in your life... I specifically like the gentle yoga for people like me with limited physical capability... It is also family-oriented with yoga classes of offered for kids and for all ages including teens.. My kids are all grown up but if I still have young kids or teens, I'll surely enroll them at Green Locus Yoga.. Highly recommend this studio!
__label__5	If you want Cajun food without going to New Orleans, this is the place! Papa and Mama Roux did a recent overhaul and redesigned their whole approach and it is nothing short of amazing! Living in Irvington there is no shortage of local restaurants but this place is superb. I have had multiple neighbors mention how quick this place is now. So GO.... eat PoBoys... eat bread pudding... whatever, just go! If you don't go here, go somewhere else local. #EATLOCAL
__label__5	Even though The Gas Lamp has probably needed renovating since the 50s the food they serve is outstanding. Based on the food I was surprised the place wasn't packed. The pork chop I ordered was perfectly cooked and not the least bit dry. Everyone else in our group was happy with their meal as well. Please don't hesitate to eat here. It would be a shame if it closed.
__label__5	This is one of the best Bone Fish restaurants  I have been too.  They have alway exceeded my expectations.  The warm bread is really good but if you like it soft you need to request it that way. Also everyone loves the bang bang shrimp appetizer but I like the coconut shrimp.  Enjoy.
__label__5	This place is awesome!!!! Took a small road trip out of St. Pete, and I'm so glad I had looked up places of interest! I had such a blast! Brought me right back to childhood!
__label__5	Awesome pie place in downtown Clearwater. They are still serving To-Go food and beverages during this lunacy so please come support this business!!
__label__5	I had great experience here. Met Brittany the minute we walked in the door, and she was fabulous! She helped us pick out furniture without overwhelming us (which is easy to do). Then she came by the house and measure the new porch (while dodging work men) at no extra charge. She brought back accessories to choose from once the furniture was delivered. I would highly recommend Brittany and Summer Classics if you need furniture!!
__label__5	My top place to go for bubble tea! Good thing it is somewhat near my college. Lychee popping boba is amazing! A chill place.For sure gonna come back.
__label__5	Super friendly nice staff, love the options of cream cheese they have, they make a killer everything bagel! I also asked for a small side of the veggie cream cheese and they didn't even charge me. Love this place
__label__5	A group of friends and I came here to try the banana double chocolate dessert on the menu we seen on a website that it was a thing to try in NOLA. Caleb was our server and he was so nice and attentive! We ordered two different kinds of the dessert and it was worth it! So yummy! Thank you again Caleb!
__label__5	Delicious food and great service! A hidden gem in the area. If you can put your order in 10-15 earlier it can be ready when you arrive, because they make everything fresh. Can't wait for the next time I get a gyro from Santorini
__label__5	"I've tried every popular cheese steak place in Philly, and hands down Chinks is superior to all of them. Since they make your steak in the order it was ordered, I suggest calling 20 minutes in advance on Saturdays when I've seen it get extremely busy. 

It's not a very large place, but on those not-so-busy-days grab a booth and enjoy your steak fresh off the grill in a place that still looks like a 1955 cut-away. Also, try their cherry coke. They make it the old fashioned way of adding the cherry flavor right there."
__label__5	I love this place! The food is great!  Staff is very nice. This is one of my favorite places. The Catfish & Chicken is the Best!!
__label__5	Spectacular food and amazing service. The staff really tries to make your experience perfect. Young and hip, with a totally friendly vibe. One of the best in my travels.
__label__5	"Delicious maple and bacon scone. Don't have. A photo because we ate it so fast. It's a must try. They have some gluten free pastries as well. Tons of healthy options and amazing coffee! Owner is super accommodating too. Long line went super fast and everyone in there was nice. A nice mix of locals and visitors. Will definitely be back. 
Sit outside and chat up the locals. 
Great taste of New Orleans. :)"
__label__5	Amazing food! Amazing service by Kishor! He always kept our drinks full! Came during happy hour and got the bang bang shrimp, crawfish beignets, & 1/2 dozen chargrilled oysters! All were delicious would definitely recommend and be back!
__label__5	Stopped in on a whim for some slices... Pepp, a classic, and white with brocc. Both were DELISH, everyone was super friendly. Def my new pizza place.
__label__5	Wonderful food and service! Our server, McKenzie, tended to our every need with grace and diligence. She provided wonderful recommendations and detailed answers to my party's questions. McKenzie made my friends and me feel so taken care of and is one of the best servers I have encountered! Will definitely be back.
__label__5	"I got the breakfast platter 2. Eggs were done perfectly over medium as I requested. The pancakes were fluffy and delicious. I have moved to Chesterbrook a year and a half ago. It took me this long to ""find"" this place. I'm regretting not finding it sooner. I'll definitely be back"
__label__5	Wish there were more local coffee shops in Tucson. This place is great I often get cappuccinos and frappucinos (however you spell it!) and they taste waaaay better than Starbucks. Service is lovely as well.
__label__5	If anyone rates this place any less than 5 they have some screws loose. By far the best fastening food I've had in Nashville. Service is great. They serve liquor and the food was out of this world!!!! Great quality ingredients.......
__label__5	I love the Forest Flower! I own many houseplants but after awhile it is hard to find new varities at stores in Indy; the Forest Flower is so great because they receive new shipments of plants every week and new pots at least once a month! It's a plant lovers paradise! I visit frequently to add to me collection and can't wait for my next visit to see what is new!
__label__5	First time visiting this Spa, found it through the Mindbody app. I was blown away with the service and professionalism. Aileen was my nail technician and she was nothing short of amazing. Her attention to detail was impeccable. He knew I was on a time constraint and didn't skimp on anything, but finished in the perfect time. Most definitely will be back!
__label__5	This place is actually amazing, best flan I've ever had. Staff wears masks, is socially distanced. Really a pleasure to eat here/takeout!
__label__5	The ambiance, view & service was AMAZING! The burger & fries were good & so was the Grey Goose.
__label__5	Houghton location- I came in for an oil change and was met with friendly service, a nice clean lobby, good shows on their T.V. and they have Galaga! Great for the kids! I didn't feel pressured to purchase more than I needed & they fixed a minor issue with great care:) Thank you!
__label__5	We had the grits and tomato braised mushroom with poached egg. I wanted to lick the bowl afterward. That tomato sauce was to die for. We also had chicken liver toast with a pickled or sweet beet topping and the caviar garnished creamy omelette. My goodness, they are not stingy with those high quality, rich ingredients. Amazing meal. I would come back for the grits alone (or ship that sauce to Seattle please!)
__label__5	Been going here for 10+ years, always good service, they do a great job on grooming your furry friend
__label__5	"I came here for the first time in hopes getting a great breakfast after a week of finals. AND that's exactly what I got. Wild Eggs is very welcoming, open and very hip. Everything was egg themed and it was very chic. I had an ""egg-cellent"" experience and plan to dine here again!"
__label__5	My family and had lots of fun. It was our first time there. And we are greeted by a manager named Tita. She was very helpful and nice. This place is great. Recommend it to all.
__label__5	Excellent food and service. Whenever we pick up food, they are very friendly- giving us a free soda if the food isn't ready yet.
__label__5	They are so professional, nice, and welcoming. I have been going for over 4 years now, I even moved and stay drive 20 min away to have my nails done and pedicure.  Lo is this best so know me so well I don't have tell her how to design my nails she already knows what I like.  And their work last a long time after service.
__label__5	"I have purchased multiple  properties in the last twenty years with Sarah's lending expertise.
Sarah's knowledge and integrity are exceptional."
__label__5	"Absolutely terrific=Boathouse Roll!
Im soooo coming back!!
This place made my heart smile!.
My server was a Sweetheart named Chris."
__label__5	Amazing place with an amazing view! Just made my day! The spruce garden is just amazing at night! 5 stars!
__label__5	Phenomenal food and the best indian in Nashville. The food is always fresh, flavorful, and well priced. Hard to beat the 10 dollar lunch buffet special. The chicken tikka masala is delicious.
__label__5	Awesome! Love the atmosphere and the service! Steak cooked over an mesquite open fire is amazing! We will go out of our way to eat here against n if we are traveling south. - Sue, Minnesota
__label__5	Went to YaYa's for breakfast this morning. We both had Breakfast on the Go with Coffee! Best breakfast under $10 I have had in a long time! The staff was super friendly and the food was wonderful! Plan to make several trips back!
__label__5	The prefect Sunday Afternoon Refreshing Cocktail! Life's a Peach be sure to order this drink on your next visit!
__label__5	My fiance went there to get my engagement ring this spring and it turned out beautifully. He went in knowing only a few key words and my ring size. The jeweler there was able to take those ideas and create the perfect ring. I love that my ring is one of a kind and I have Scotsman to thank! We plan on returning for our wedding bands soon!
__label__5	My family and I go to The Cup regularly. We recently bought cupcakes from there to serve at our son's first birthday. The BEST cupcakes we've ever had! We tried Jilly's today since they recently opened in Edwardsville but will continue to just go to The Cup! Cupcakes are much more moist and better priced!
__label__5	Beautiful area for nature walks, and wildlife photography! Lot of varied terrain, and huge amounts of wildlife and water birds of all sorts! I saw a number of Ospreys here... unfortunately I was not able to get any good photographs of them in flight, just one shot while feeding high in a tree, but did shoot a lot of other birds. Highly recommended for anyone that enjoys nature!
__label__5	Best vodka I have ever tasted! I was pleased to visit the tasting room to find awesome service, BOMB piff cocktails and great atmosphere. I would advise everyone to check it out ASAP!
__label__5	Maplewood Wash House is not dingy like a lot of laundromats. Very bright and open and in the time I was there I saw tables and machines being sprayed and wiped down several times. Dryers are free, which is AWESOME.
__label__5	Great beer and friendly staff. Extra plus for being dog-friendly inside :) Excellent COVID measures in place, with masks required, hand sanitizer available, and tables clearly marked as being sanitized. Looking forward to our next trip!
__label__5	Fantastic customer service, and great food! Will definitely be back. For those of you who are visiting New Orleans this is definitely a restaurant to try!
__label__5	The best Indian food I have ever had...even better than the Indian food I had in London. I have only had the chicken tikka masala and its awesome.  I want to try other items on the menu but its hard not to keep ordering the chicken tikka masala because its that good.
__label__5	This is an excellent restaurant and a great atmosphere.  The Escargot is to die for.  The steak and sides are fantastic.  Great service and their wine guy was pretty good but I did not go crazy for the wine he suggested.  The night my bf and I went we ended up with a late reservation and ended up shutting the place down.  They did not rush us and everyone there was a complete delight.  I can't wait to go back.
__label__5	Polite Society does not disappoint!! Anything you get on the menu will leave you very satisfied and eager to return. I had a friend visit from Raleigh, NC for the weekend and she loves brunch. Of all the brunch places I have been to in St. Louis, there was no other place I wanted to take her than Polite Society!!
__label__5	wow this place is just fantastic!   Dishes are much spicier than most restaurants it in a very balanced way.
__label__5	Best Ramen I've had in Tampa/St.Pete area! The origami cocktail with oolong infused sake was incredible too!
__label__5	I really liked our room. We were expecting a queen and they ended up putting us in a room with a king bed. Everything was super nice and clean. The shower was HUGE and the bed was by far the most comfortable hotel bed I've ever slept on. The breakfast was good and the pool was warm. We were right across the street from the beach which was perfect for our planned fishing trip with the Stardust. We were very happy with our stay! Will definitely be staying here again next time we go fishing in SB.
__label__5	Best Manhattan thus far this year. Shrimp appetizer was great with the homemade horsey sauce.  Halibut special and cooked to perfection. Finished with the bread budding. All excellent and very good service.  We will be back.
__label__5	"I love yoga six!! Amazing classes and teachers!! I look forward to every class! The studio is very swank as well!! 
-katie Zilm"
__label__5	"Now this place has got it right.  I've been here twice now, and both experiences have been excellent.  This small but comfortable sports bar atmosphere is perfect.  The service and friendliness of the staff is excellent.  And the food..........WOW!  Burgers are absolutely amazing.  Salads are made with real greens (not cheap iceberg lettuce) with a variety of vegetables.  Mixed drinks are nicely sized.  Prices are very fair.  

We love this place and will be back again!"
__label__5	Love Japanese restaurants? I do, this one is a good one.  Never had a bad meal.  Lots a nice people! Good Service and Drinks and funny Chefs. Chef Fluffy and Jackie are a great combo but Amanda and others are fun too!
__label__5	This Friday night,  my son took us out to dinner! Of course it's a busy Friday night,  but we got seating in 20 minutes! My son and I ordered the 6 ounce steak and loaded baked potatoes! Very good! My daughter ordered bbq chicken and loved it! Thank you for a noisy but great dinner! Andrew our server did a great job!
__label__5	Milk and Honey has a great variety of food and it is easy to tell that it is a crowd favorite. This place was highly recommended and after going there for lunch I can totally see why. I ordered the fried chicken biscuit sandwich and it definitely hit the spot. To be honest I am not big on biscuits but this sandwich seemed like perfection and I was very pleased. The texture of the biscuit along with the chicken/gravy made every bite so delightful. This is a must try if you're in the neighborhood :)
__label__5	@sqwires1415 is an awesome place to eat! Especially if you are on a special diet. I let them know about being soy/dairy/gluten free and they made me a free range turkey burger with over easy free range egg and grilled onions. Along with a side salad with walnuts and raisins. So delicious!  They were so nice and accommodating! I'll definitely be back!
__label__5	Every drink we tried was fantastic! The staff were all so friendly and had great drink recommendations! Everything was very sanitary given the COVID restrictions and the DJ was awesome :)
__label__5	Was in the area today(having a pretty bad day), and decided to check this spot out. Ordered a chicken parmesan which was top notch. It came with a lot of food, all super good. Cheered me up for sure. May have just been hungry... Really glad I found this place!
__label__5	We had Thanksgiving dinner - everything was great. Loved the sausage and sage dressing.  Had the chocolate lava cake for dessert - excellent. Ray was our server and he was awesome. Would definitely come back.
__label__5	Everything we tried was delicious!  They have great huge burgers, yummy pizza, and even homemade soups. Great little place off the beaten path. We will certainly be back to try more.
__label__5	Their quote was pretty on point, they explained everything that needed to be done well, and I think I got a good value for it. They're good with minimizing the work (ex: making the paint match well enough instead of perfectly) when they learn if a customer is paying out of pocket vs using insurance, which I appreciated.
__label__5	The best kale salad ever. Been a little tough to get during COVID, but really looking forward to things being back to normal!
__label__5	"My friend who owns Star Auto Body had referred me to Frank, as that is who he only uses for his own vehicles and trusted him and his workmanship.

I found Frank, to be honest, upfront, takes pride in his work, and they are a local family-owned business like us. I will be returning with other vehicles and send friends there also."
__label__5	"The clear soup is the stuff of which dreams are made of and it's free with almost every entree. 

Vietnamese Crepes are rollin'. 

Bubble teas are delicious.  

I also like the steak sesame bowl.  Servers are nice and the owners are as well.  I've been going since they opened in 03-04."
__label__5	Great shop!  Nice and friendly owner and staff.  Best selection for authentic mods.  Ejuice selection is killer. I'm about an hour away from this place but I will be going back.
__label__5	We have had consistently wonderful food here, with family and friends. Mostly Italian dishes, take-some-home portions, fabulous bread/pizza slices before dinner. Comfortable interior and lovely warm-weather outside patio. Warm and friendly staff.
__label__5	FABULOUS beer, nice ambience inside and outside patio deck, lacked fun energy but perf place to chill. If you're looking for tasty local beer and a chill spot to hang, def check it out!!!!
__label__5	Another delicious meal and great service.  Cajun grilled grouper with potatoes and grilled zucchini. My friend had grilled salmon with wild rice spinach something.. she didn't realize it was like a salad so it's cold but very tasty.  We split dessert which was some kind of snickers, caramel ice cream cake.  It was worth the splurge.
__label__5	So hard to get a reservation! The best mozzarella sticks and cacio e pepe I've ever had. A must place to eat at in Philly.
__label__5	Great spot for Eastern European food. The Goulash was excellent. Came back for the Chicken Paprikash a week later. Delicious and reasonably priced. I'll need to try the stuffed cabbage next time.
__label__5	This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in the Treasure Valley. The Pollo La Crema is amazing and we have always had excellent service (even with our wild kids). The server remembers us, even if it's been a few months. They are very accommodating and it's always a great experience.
__label__5	Fun group fitness workouts with energetic coaches. The price point is a bit high but when you consider the coaching rather than just a simple gym membership, it makes a bit more sense. Studio is clean, staff is friendly!
__label__5	I used the yelp coupon for a free smoothie or froyo if you check in. My smoothie tasted great! I had the protein blend banana smoothie in a medium size. Thanks for the delicious free treat! Recommended :-)
__label__5	We always come here to play or have fun with the kids. They seem to always make some awesome changes to their casino. All ages from kids to seniors have something fun to do. GSR is our favorite casino in Reno.
__label__5	Wonderful Store with a huge selection.  My salesman Rob was extremely helpful with our selections and design.  Very impressed with how careful and thorough Linc and Kevin were with my pick up process.  Highly recommend Avalon for any tile needs.
__label__5	My group came in for some pre dinner drinks and had the best service with the most AMAZING..... LIFE ALTERING margaritas ever! Christina knows her stuff! She made us the cucumber Chile and jalapeno margaritas. Thank you Christina for your great service!
__label__5	Small, cozy, very casual restaurant with the one of the best sushi in Philly!! Prices are very reasonable and the rolls are delicious! Always friendly customer service. One of my favorites!!
__label__5	Best in the city! Been going for 20 years. LONG LINES. Very long. Bring extreme patience. You won't be disappointed. Lol
__label__5	"I am absolutely IN LOVE with their salmon over pesto. I crave it all the time. Best thing I have ever eaten in Temple Terrace by far. Also, the wait staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is relaxed. Be sure you try the gelato too. So. Freakin'. Good.

Also, I subscribed to their Facebook page. They seem to always have really good specials."
__label__5	We saw the reviews and ended up trying it anyways. The food was great! The service was awesome! Super courteous and prompt. The food took a little time, but we'll worth it!
__label__5	"Cheap, fast, and no complaints about the results! The inside ""store"", where you walk in to watch your car being washed and where you pay for wash, is FILLED with all different kinds of different interior accessories as well as cleaning supplies! I never seen a car wash like this before! Will most def be using this to give my car a bath every time!"
__label__5	"Best Tapas in Philly.
Even the time we went here during restaurant week we still got a great selection.
Could say its a little pricey but well worth it.
Can't wait to go back!"
__label__5	After staying the night in Frenchmen, we needed a pick me up the morning after. Great spot for a quick breakfast and coffee. Friendly staff!
__label__5	My boyfriend & I have been missing date nights, so we decided to mix it up and order take out from here. We've never tried it before. It is the most authentic tasting italian place we have tried in Tucson. For a place promoting vegan/vegetarian options, you do not have to be either of these to absolutely love the food. It exceeded our expectations BY FAR. Special shoutout to their house baked bread. We also ordered the Bianca Pizza and the Caputo Raviolo, which both were so amazing and tasty in their own way. This is our new favorite italian spot!
__label__5	Have been going here for years! They are like the Publix and Chick-fil-a of tires! Customer service is great and great prices always makes this my favorite tire place!
__label__5	Fabulous place. From beginning to end, the service, the food, and the selections, everything is absolutely fabulous.
__label__5	I used this company to get to and from LAX and Carpinteria. Adriana, the owner was our driver. She is very professional. The vehicle was clean and comfortable. Our pick up at both destinations was timely and right on schedule. Best of all they communicate with you the day before you are to be picked up so you know they are going to be there as scheduled. I will be using this company again and highly recommend them.
__label__5	Our salon hired Ken's BBW to cater our Christmas party. The guys and girls at Ken's helped to ensure everything went perfect. Ken's was new to almost everybody and it was a grand slam. Thank you and your whole crew
__label__5	I live right near this place, a true bar through and through.  A place where you can hear yourself speak, bring a bunch of friends and buy a round without having to break the bank, a grate beer selection, always someone friendly to talk to.  all in all the true definition of a good bar.
__label__5	Prompt and professional, Pablo came by today and cleared our line in minutes.
__label__5	"This review is strictly for their cappuccinos, which I have quite often. 

While most places in NOLA are hit or miss with espresso-based drinks, I've gotta think that someone trains the baristas at The Orange Couch. Every one of them makes a mean cappuccino. Proper ratios, freshly ground beans, expert foam. Mind blown."
__label__5	Love this place. Their menu has a large selection to choose from. I've always been happy with the food, service, and delivery they have provided.
__label__5	I flew in from Los Angeles and finding good Italian food was a priority. Piccolo's does not disappoint! The bread was amazing and served warm. We had bacon wrapped shrimp as an appetizer. The shrimps were huge! My chicken parm was delicious. Our waiter Greg was amazing. He was willing to do anything for us. Attentive, funny and accommodating. Perfect addition to a perfect meal. I highly suggest having dinner there. Thumbs up! Thanks Greg!
__label__5	"I usually try to stop here when I'm in the area. It's a small shop but they carry a lot. (Guns, ammo, accessories, optics, etc.)

If you're looking for something there's a pretty good chance they carry it or have it in stock."
__label__5	Came in on a Saturday and was seen as soon as I completed the paperwork. The staff here is very friendly, approachable and professional. It made all the difference with my experience. Would trek over here again.
__label__5	Great value for the money! The 60 minute facial is incredibly relaxing and only $35! Much less than you would pay at a salon. Students here are taught professional behavior and do their best, but keep in mind that they are still learning, so give them a break! I have also had my haircut here many times and never had a bad experience. Thanks Aveda!
__label__5	"I enjoy eating at Mod Pizza their all
Very friendly and the pizza is delicious! Liam is super
Friendly and very helpful ! I have never gotten such an amazing customer service like the one he provides! Simple amazing! Keep up the good work Liam!"
__label__5	I passed this place every single day, but due to the word Sushi being in the name I never stopped in. My coworkers wanted to go one day and I was out numbered and had no choice so i made it there. I ordered the shrimp tempura which of course came with vegetables in tempura also. It was very very good!!! I think it cost 9 bucks but it was very tasty. I thought it was definitely worth the money. Of course all of my friends ordered sushi which they said was really good too!
__label__5	Always a delicious experience at the Eagle! They have the best chicken sandwich and surprisingly, their chicken salad is something I get frequently! However, be warned, it's always packed. For good reason obviously! But if you go at 6pm on a weekend, be prepared to wait! You can always visit some nearby Mass Ave restaurants/bars fir a drink while you wait!
__label__5	Wow Dat Dog. I cannot say enough good things about this place. Being from Chicago, I know some damn good dawgs, but everything I knew came crashing down to Earth the second I took a bite of a sausage. The bartender was a genuinely nice dude, got in our orders and provided solid recommendations. Ordered the son of saint, took a bite, and my wig flew to outer space. I'm not kidding, I'm bald now. Worth it though.
__label__5	Smells amazing of course. I really appreciate the efforts they have made to be sanitary and environmentally conscious during this difficult time!
__label__5	Everything was tasty from the drinks to rolls. Service was really fast. Try to get second floor patio seats for the best view of the pier.
__label__5	I can see why food network's DDD came here. The cheese steak was the best in the city!!  Will be back!  The potato salad was just ok. But I came for the big meat sandwich
__label__5	I just had my first appointment here and I must say this was lovely. The staff was friendly and the owner was very insightful. She took the time to explain what she was doing to my hair and why. I really felt like I was listened to and I am pleased with the work that was done. Having just had a baby there are so many concerns I have as it pertains to my hair falling out and I think with the help of this salon I can get it back on track. I can't wait for my next appointment. I was in and out and appreciate the promptness.
__label__5	"Our server was Ian. He was super nice and friendly. Everyone there is nice and friendly. 
The coffee is great and they have ID flavored creamers! 
I had the 2/2/2. Eggs cooked perfectly. Bacon was delish. 
French toast is amazing. Cooked perfectly. The orange cream cheese was rich and delish. 
My gf had the loaded pancakes. She said the pancakes were possibly the best pancakes she has ever had in her entire life. She said the pancakes were nice and moist, the raspberry sauce was amazing, the fruit was fresh and a good amount. Definitely delicious."
__label__5	We just purchased a headboard and Tempurpedic mattress at Ashley Furniture. Worked with Anthony who was extremely knowledgeable and helpful. I would recommend him and this store to anyone in the market for a new mattress. Can't wait to receive them both!
__label__5	"Michael's takeout was really, really good! 

If planning an event - Michael's was one of the easiest restaurants that I worked with for a complicated catering order. I also was lucky enough to get an order in as well. 

My favorite thing that I ordered were the stuffed grape leaves. They were super filling, I actually had to save my entree for later!"
__label__5	"First of all, the staff we encountered was extremely friendly and helpful. And the food?? DELICIOUS!!! I had the double burger and my only ""issue"" was it was HUGE!! Yet the strange part of it all, is it would order it again!!! The price was topping on the cake! Very affordable! Almost cheaper than going to one of the fast food places!"
__label__5	Michelle was our server and she was so attentive to us and our 15 month old son. Food was spectacular. Definitely a must stop place when you're here in Reno
__label__5	Victor was great! He stopped by today to fix our oven. In less than an hour it was up and running like new. He is professional, courteous, on-time, and was a pleasure to speak with. I would highly recommend him for your repair needs!
__label__5	This has probably become one of my go to places food for Mexican food. It has been hard to find a good (at least semi authentic) Mexican restaurant in the area. The tacos have no lettuce!!!  That to me is everything!!!! I hate lettuce on tacos! The flavor was authentic! Got 2 Carne Asada tacos and 1 Pastor taco. I will definitely be back to try more of their dishes. My co worker tried the Carne Asada and was also really pleased at the flavor.
__label__5	Pets Best Insurance management deserves 5 stars. This company is so attentive and customer service oriented I felt compelled to write this review. Had a rough year with my dog, including the first claims I've ever made and I have carried insurance since he was born 13 years ago. They get on the phone and help you through the entire process. And the follow through is over and above. I'm incredibly impressed, especially because the last company I used made it difficult to [even] pay a premium, not to mention get assistance. Cheers Pets Best and thanks for all the great service!
__label__5	"The menu and location are awesome. Great prices and unique selection of food.

I love vegan spots because they always offer excellent items. Mediocre vegan food spots don't have a chance of staying in business, so you are left with spots that really put a lot of thought and care into their offerings."
__label__5	The fritattas are great, the potatoes are even better! Wonderful coffee, staff can occasionally be prickly. Nice urban brunch, a bit loud. Cash only.
__label__5	Best hot dogs if you can even call them that they are so good but save money and split fries they give you a huge portion dogs are good and very customize able the topping are endless as well so many choices. Bacon cheddar ranch fries are best ordered with the dressing on the side or it becomes a sloppy mess, seriously that's the only thing wrong with that place they are that awesome!
__label__5	This is one of my favorite bars! Lance and the rest of the bartenders are awesome! Best bloody mary's in the world!
__label__5	crazy delicious food. the line and wait for the chicken was crazy long for a friday at lunchtime but wow this is incredible chicken. extremely crispy and great crinkle fries. when they mean HOT chicken they really mean it. great restaurant to try out what nashville is famous for.
__label__5	Delicious Pizza, Stromboli and Mussles! Also fresh tasty salads. Very friendly staff.
__label__5	Awesome place to grab to go drinks or enjoy there, I've done both many times. Local feel, staff is always knowledgeable and helpful. Have not tried the food but have heard good things.
__label__5	Love this place.  We visit Clearwater 1-2 times a year for a week each trip.  Cristino's is on the dinner menu at least twice every time. If you love coal/brick oven pizza this is a must visit.  Honestly can't tell you about their other menu options, because it's ALWAYS pizza (and gelato) for us at Cristino's!!!
__label__5	"OMG the dry rub ribs ...  Fabulous 

The sides were good as well,  fried peach pie was VERY good"
__label__5	Yes, it's on the back of a truck on the street. D&W dogs. Cooked right. Steamed bun. Really cheap. Despite long lines,  moves very fast. Great toppings. Super nice owner. Great hot dog by any standard but If you're down on you luck college student or just cheap it's a real find!!
__label__5	Love love love this place! Sure the sound of a burrito with French fries sound off but don't knock it until you try it. Try the California Burrito but be prepared as it is huge. The sauces are homemade and never disappoint.
__label__5	"This is just a gem in downtown Edmonton.
Portuguese cuisine at its finest.
The service was outstanding, our dishes were beyond explainable. I had their Bacalhau, which was really good. The perfect food for the cold Edmonton winter."
__label__5	Quality food for prices no one in town can beat! The place could use a face lift but food is good .
__label__5	After having a deplorable breakfast at another establishment in Dunedin, this one gets a stellar review!  Homemade corned beef hash so tender!  Spicy bloody mary...yum! Our waitress Mary was pleasant and attentive.  We will return.
__label__5	We had a great experience there. Room was clean and service was good. The room/bathroom has a weird set-up (ie the TV wasn't able to be viewed from the bed properly), but that's expected in an older building. Pools are nice, beach is beautiful and there is lots to do. Spa is overpriced, but a great experience.
__label__5	The Wax Pot is amazing. Kelly was very gentle and I felt comfortable throughout the process. Definitely recommend getting your wax here.
__label__5	Laura is a good server. 5 stars for her.  Food was good. The chicken for the app was a little to well done. But edible.
__label__5	Currently doing takeout during COVID and I love the pork tacos. Great prices and tasty drinks too (I recommend the cantaloupe drink). I get the pork tacos and they come with radish, onion, carrot, and a pepper on the side. You also get two different sauces to put on the tacos if you like.
__label__5	I've been going to this papa Johns for years, even when it was on Gandy. They are so fast. Always hot. Always good. Only one time wasn't. We ordered a Shaq pepperoni pizza. Not great. But we told them and they refunded us. They're are good peeps. Our favorite is double Italian sausage and green pepper. Also the half price when the bolts win or the Rays score 6 runs. Can not beat it!! Also you can ask to have the crust extra crispy. Really good.
__label__5	This excellent thai food the best i have ever tasted.  Never been disappointed with this restaurant. Excellent service.
__label__5	"Dr. Charbel & team have genuinely been the most caring and helpful professionals that I have ever encountered for my neck and shoulder pain.  What makes this place special is that the word ""integrated"" is truly how things work here.  From chiropractic care to acupuncture to soft tissue work and therapy, Dr Jen & Dr Charbel will work with you on a custom treatment plan that will get you results."
__label__5	Love the pizza and salad lunch special at Renée's! The food is always so fresh and flavorful.
__label__5	This place is great! I recently moved to Tucson and have come here twice already to get my eyebrows threaded. I have not left disappointed! Both times I did not have an appointment and was still seen. Did not wait more than 10 minutes to be seen. Would definitely recommend and will keep coming back!
__label__5	i've been going to CWB my whole entire life.. shanty's is my absolute favorite. this spring break i think we went 5 or 6 times in a week. the pancakes are amazing, the eggs are amazing, mimosas, coffee, bacon, the staff. the homemade coconut icing/syrup is my favorite, i love it! wish i lived closer!
__label__5	Jonathan gives a great haircut and color.  I always leave Cashmir happy and feeling like my hair has a whole new lease on life- bouncy, full of life and vibrant.  The salon is quaint but well designed.  Easy and convenient.
__label__5	Everything was great! The beer was ice cold, the house salad was fresh and tasty, and the blooming onions were hot and crisp. I had a porterhouse streak, medium rare. It was cooked perfectly, and baked potatoes were yummy. The waitress was friendly and attentive. Five stars!
__label__5	This is a great place and the food is very tasty and healthy. What could be better than that! The owner is very friendly and I will be coming back here for lunch.
__label__5	"Have been going here for two years and service is outstanding. I am VP of Operations for company I work for and I need reliable fast service and shipping for domestic and overseas.
Shipments are always on time per the delivery date and never damaged.

Helpful staff and very fast to help. Great packaging."
__label__5	Great authentic food, friendly service!!! Can't wait to go back!! Verde carnitas was delicious, fish tacos were the best we ever had and even the kids meals were delicious!! I have food allergies and the were very accommodating.
__label__5	Chaat and Chai is an awesome new addition to South Philly!!! LOVED the chai and the daal, but everything was delicious. A+ decor, music, food, service, and overall fabulous experience!!! EAT HERE!!!
__label__5	Best thing about Alton, and only thing I miss, tbh (no offense to those who consider the town home). It puts all other gay bars and drag shows to shame.
__label__5	Attentive service. Great coffee and delicious food. Reasonably sized portions...wasn't so stuffed as to enter a food coma.
__label__5	We tried unlimited Korean BBQ for $20. Unlimited sides are really good. Of course, the BBQ was the best part of our meal. We'll come back.
__label__5	Always a good time. Anthony lead us well on our adventure here. I can't wait to come back.
__label__5	"We went to our 1st Wedding Food Tasting and I can tell you that Andre's did not disappoint. 
If you are looking to make your Wedding planning easy on you, then Andre's one stop shop is the way to go.
We tasted great food, all the Vendors they work with were there to answer any questions you have and to book your date right then.
There are multiple locations to chose from so they have every location that suits your style."
__label__5	Derby Supply Co. is an amazing shop which is easy to get to from the nearby parking garage. Troy and Vinnie were very welcoming and Troy did an excellent job for this first-time customer. He took the time to ask about my preferred style and checked multiple times during the appointment to make sure things were on track. This is a very nice place for a gentleman to get a haircut, shave and even a drink.
__label__5	Delicious!!!! Not a fan of oysters but I had to try the signature char grilled oysters. Although the texture was not what I expected the taste was surprisingly satisfying. The lobster mac and cheese is a must have; it's rich and bursting with flavor. It's a large portion but it's so good you will not want to share with anyone. The shrimp and grits has just the right amount of spice and flavor. I really enjoyed dining here. It's a must visit when in New Orleans.
__label__5	Are you looking for a realtor who will put your first? Knows her business and can skillfullly negotiate for you? Michelle is amazing. As a fellow realtor my expectations are high. After interviewing multiple realtors to sell my mothers home in Santa Barbara Michelle came in wth her listing presentation. Within minutes we knew she was the one. It took my mother over a year to make the move and Michelle was there every step of the way. She is a great marketer, shrewd negotiator and great communicator. I would recommend her to anyone wanting to buy or sell.
__label__5	surprisingly good food. you can tell the food is made with care, and designed or selected by someone with a good palate. would be fitting to serve in an upscale restaurant--dont let the look of the place fool you. food comes out on the slow side, but not unusual for dishes of this caliber. dont expect low prices despite the decor; the food is priced appropriately for the quality you get. service is good too.
__label__5	Loved it!  I ordered beef bulgogi, and my son the extra spicy pork bulgogi.  Both were great. We also had the mochi and liked it.  I recommend this place and will be back!
__label__5	BEST PIZZA IN FLORIDA! We went here because of all the great reviews on yelp & it did not disappoint. the pizza is amazing, the bruschetta is good a little under seasoned but they bring you O&V to season it with. The only bad thing is the mozzarela sticks they were frozen not fresh made (will never order them again). Overall the pizza is what makes this place & even with the downfall I am still giving a 5 star because of the pizza. Start with the plain.
__label__5	This super cool coffee house never disappoints! I love this place! My black and white caramel mocha is always perfect. It helps too that the treats are out of this world. My personal favorite, the Oreo stuffed chocolate chip cookie, always makes the trip here complete.
__label__5	This nail salon is one of the best in Nashville. If you haven't gotten a Mani/pedi from there, you really owe it to yourself!
__label__5	Take it from a family of seven that visited celebrating my sons 13 birthday...the food is AMAZING!!! We had meatballs and spaghetti, two types of calzones, pepperoni pizza, cheese pizza, calamari, and lobster pizza! Did you catch that I said LOBSTER pizza and it was fresh and lots of it!!! All I can say is find it and enjoy you won't be disappointed!
__label__5	Tish R was our server and she was amazing. The food was great, as always. We will be back next time we are in town.
__label__5	Best Chinese restaurant in Wilmington. Impressive and attentive customer service. Wish I could walk there every day!!
__label__5	Excellent food for a great price. Portions size are very generous. Friendly staff. Will be eating here again!
__label__5	My favorite restaurant in the St. Charles area! We love to come here and try the new features each weekend when we can. Had our wedding rehearsal dinner here earlier this year and the amount of food and alcohol we got for the money was far beyond anywhere else--not to mention the quality. Everyone loved it and I still get comments!
__label__5	The food is definitely worth the price, even if it is packed, you don't have to wait long for your food. The people are very nice as well!
__label__5	Nice cute little deli in downtown dunedin. I got the half sandwich with a soup/salad combo yet somehow got both the soup and salad. I am not complaining though. Soup of the day was celery and it was delicious. Nice and warm and very flavorful. The salad was a pretty well filled one, chopped olives, spinach, banana peppers, beans, tomatoes...really good. My sandwich was the roast beef and it was pretty nice. The lady serving me was very helpful and quick.
__label__5	Full of flavor the chicken tikka is spot on. So creamy and flavorful. The tandoori chicken was delicious. Did not disappoint.
__label__5	Came here last night an hour before closing. Ordered the company burger with fries. My brother had a cookie milkshake, burger and sweet potato fries. Burger was great! Good size to fill you up, but not so big where toppings are falling off. The hand cut fries were good as well. Brother said his meal was really good as well. Friendly laid back atmosphere. I'd definitely recommend.
__label__5	Very friendly staff, they serve one of the best Dim Sum I've tasted in a long time. We tried the beef fried rice, orange peeled chicken and my ultimate favorite the Basil Beef. Everything was very tasty, can't wait until I'm back in town.
__label__5	"Shoefly is fantastic. 

I've gotten the chili mac & cheese (delicious), the philly pretzel nuggets (delicious and a great item to split), and enjoyed plenty of libations. They have a great beer selection upstairs and in the basement when they have events.

The staff and management are all fantastic, and they really support the Indianapolis community. Check out the comedy, music, and trivia events!"
__label__5	Amazing donuts and great ambiance. People were very friendly and quick customer service.
__label__5	The *bacon wrapped dates* is definitely one of the most uniquely delicious things I have eaten all year
__label__5	Wound up here randomly on a trip to Philadelphia. Such a nice staff... Turned on my football game for me, went out of their way to modify an item to make it vegetarian for me, bartender was so knowledgeable and helpful about the beer selection. Food was unbelievable. I couldn't recommend this bar enough!
__label__5	Love this place! Their flying pig waffle is my absolute fav! I can never eat another plain waffle ever again :)
__label__5	"I love this place! It's like Cheers!!! Understand the food is made fresh and this is not Applebee's ! The location is busy and you will have to wait if you don't make reservations! The people complaining on here about the food and wait need to understand if something isn't right they will fix it! 

Jake Zack Toby Alexa Tanya make this place great!!!"
__label__5	I started going to Salon Bass after moving to the city from the burbs. Kayla does phenomenal work - my coworker commented that it was the best hair cut she has seen me sport... I would HIGHLY recommend Salon Bass. Very friendly staff, open on Sundays - a really inviting place for a guy to get a cut.
__label__5	Our new favorite diner.   Clean, friendly service and better than average diner food.    Even the salmon was good.
__label__5	I got the Funky Monkey shake and it was AMAZING.  The employees were very friendly! I 100% recommend this place! However, I would love it if the calories were calculated& posted online for each shake, just a suggestion
__label__5	This pizza joint is a gem! One of the best restaurants in the area. I recommend from Valentino's delicious pizza to the superb hoagies all is delicious
__label__5	This is the best Italian food I've had probably in Nashville. It has a nice atmosphere and is a current favorite of mine for dinner. I like their blush sauce for pasta and their Caesar salad . Also obviously good Italian wines
__label__5	"Just stop reading reviews and order the garlic parmesan wings!

We came to town to visit a friend and they took us here. The pizza was amazing, delicious crust. The fried mushrooms were awesome, but the parmesan wings stole the show. Seriously the best wings I've had in my 34 years in Florida."
__label__5	Esquina Cantina is my new favorite Mexican restaurant. The coconut shrimp taco is hands down the best taco I've ever had. The margaritas are on point. Everything I've eaten here is a flavor explosion in my mouth. They're definitely doing something right. Check this place out. You won't be disappointed.
__label__5	This is my favorite boba spot. Hands down the best boba and rolled icecream around. The woman who owns and runs it is one of the kindest people I've ever met. She has non-dairy options and can adjust sweetness levels to your liking. I love supporting this small local business.
__label__5	STL is a beautiful city I am absolutely in love with.  We went there twice.  And I just love how clean the park is and other attractions around it.  The free zoo, art museum, science museum.  The atmosphere is just so relaxing.  I wish I can live there so I can enjoy it every day.    I highly recommend people to visit the park if they are in town.  Such a beautiful city.
__label__5	I love this spot! I haven't lived in Indy for a few years, I've moved 3 times since. Every time I make it back to town I go see Lynn and her team, I can't seem to find another salon that can do it the same. Lynn is the absolute best at doing my brows and her team is consistently good at doing my nails. I get compliments on my nails and brows every single time they do them. Of course, I love for Lynn to do my nails most but never worry if she's unavailable.
__label__5	I seriously love this place so much!!! My massage therapist is amazing. Great prices too!
__label__5	This place has a great menu with local ingredients! It's also super cute - perfect for a nice dinner or just casual drinks.
__label__5	Great nail spot- awesome service & if you call ahead they will get you on the wait list
__label__5	We had the recommended aged cowboy ribeye that was amazing with a ton of flavors and surprisingly lean cut. I can't say enough of our waitress. We love dining out and she was the best and most attentive one we ever had. She also pared the perfect wine and had suggested the balsamic ketchup for our truffle fries that my wife couldn't get enough of. I'm kicking myself because I forget her name but she is a native of Colorado and I hope she gets the credit she deserves.
__label__5	In town visiting and this looked like a good place for an omelette. I eat a keto diet so I ordered 2 Supreme omelettes with just bacon, sausage, onion, goat cheese, & avocado. It's amazing and I ate every bit of it plus a side of bacon! They gave me an English muffin even though I said I wanted no sides. I wish they wouldn't do that, so it wouldn't get wasted. But whatever!
__label__5	Second time eating here. Its now my favorite restaurant in reno. Eclectic food that just delivers rich flavor i cant imagine creating myself. Nothing bland or ordinary going on here. Its a show to sit at the bar and watch them create. Foodies in reno or visiting, you dont want to miss this.
__label__5	I love this place! Great location in Fountain Square. Super cool and interesting decorations on the inside. Staff is always great! The food is spectacular! Haven't had one thing bad here! So clean and fresh tasting!
__label__5	"Best Vegan Pho!
Tang was great especially for a party of 12 showing up a half an hour before closing."
__label__5	I love this place! Good music, friendly staff, and amazing food! Every burger I've had here has been awesome. Their beer selection is nice too. The food service is always quick and they get my order right! I love it here!
__label__5	SO GOOD. So healthy and fresh!! Y'all have to get the steak there!! SO GOOD!!! Such cute decor, quick service, so clean and bright!
__label__5	"This place is great.  Each time I've been there the place was packed, the service was quick, and the food was delicious. I love the corned beef sandwich, and their BBQ sauce is to die for.  They also have a really cool soda machine that will vend different flavors of soda, I'm assuming with some sort of syrup to mix in.

All in all this is a great place for a great lunch at just under $10 for the whole kit and caboodle."
__label__5	Hands down, best burger in Reno! I came in after a long night of clubbing with a group of my girlfriends. After already spending too much money on drinks at the club, we were a little hesitant about the prices on the menu, but our lovely waitress assured us that everything was well worth it... She was %110 right! Every single item we ordered was perfection. AMAZING food, AWESOME service, FUN & classy atmosphere! Most definitely will be coming back, my new favorite bar & burger joint :)
__label__5	Mmm yummmmm lots of different options for different tastes and moods. Priced good too!
__label__5	"Some of the best in the area. Friendly staff, and you can't beat free froyo at the grand opening. 

My wife and I have stopped in several times since the grand opening. Munchies has become our go to place for local froyo. The staff is always extremely nice and helpful. They will even let you sample individual toppings, because they have some unique offerings."
__label__5	"The food & atmosphere here is absolutely awesome! Our server, ""Rocky"" was a sweetheart and very enthusiastic- she smiled the entire time! It was a great experience."
__label__5	A big barn on the outskirts of Trenton that mostly sells discounted junk food to poor people. It also has the odd distinction of selling possibly the best ice cream in the entire world: its own brand, Seventh Heaven. After you eat a few pints of this frozen, creamy, reasonably-priced insanity, everything else is just sub-par.
__label__5	You'll never eat Dunkin Donuts again after you try Yum Yum's. After eating their wonderful confections I've never looked back
__label__5	Have been coming here for a few years.  I was back today with an illness and was seen, diagnosed and received meds all within an hour.   had great experiences from check in to Nurse Practitioner to the Pharmacist!  Maureen McLaughlin was easily to talk to,she listened and I was comfortable (even though sick)!   The pharmacist (Diana) already had my order underway by the time I got out of the exam room - smooth, personable process.  I will be back especially it being so easy.
__label__5	"What a Gem of a Restaurant and Bar. First Class Service,  The Best Food, Great Portions and Price ! 
It's our new  ""Go To Place""

T & M Anderson  -"
__label__5	This service is AMAZING!!! And the best part is that it's free! Alicia helped me find a luxury apartment in Germantown for such an affordable price. She was super sweet and easygoing and made me feel extremely comfortable. If you're looking for somewhere to live but don't know where to start, Nashville Apartment Locaters is where it's at. 10/10 would recommend and will definitely continue with them whenever I need it!
__label__5	The Carnitas here are truly amazing. I had the carnitas burrito on special and they were crispy, flavorful, and delicious. The pico they add to it was also very fresh. Their salsa bar is awesome - has many different salsas, avocado sauce, pickled onions, pickled jalapeños and carrots, etc. Great place.
__label__5	"Excellent food! Probably the best authentic Latin American food I've had in Nashville so far. The menu is mostly in Spanish, but it has English written smaller below. 

You order your food buffet style (like at Chipotle), and then pay and get your drink. Everything we ordered was spot on! I already want to go back"
__label__5	Amore has the best pizza around. The toppings are of great quality, and are plentiful. Bacon, ham and extra cheese is our company favourite. The cheese goes up onto the crust. The staff is friendly, giving a small town feel to a big city pizza parlour.
__label__5	This was our first visit. It definitely won't be the last!  I had salmon pizzaiola. My husband had lobster & crab ravioli. Both were absolutely delicious!  Generous servings. Our server was delightful!  Highly recommended.
__label__5	I haven't written a Yelp review in 8 years because I'm pretty lazy so that alone should be a testament to how much I loved my whole experience at Halo. It's so so hard to find stylists who know how to cut curly well and Heather is amazing. My layers are perfect and I honestly cannot remember a time where my hair looked so...cohesive? If that makes sense? Every strand is in its rightful place and it looks amazing and I actually can't wait to get my hair cut again.
__label__5	I'm not a big fan of eating in franchises but... this place is the real deal!!! I ordered 3 corn tortillas tacos of chipotle chicken,  shrimp and fish with guacamole, jalapenos, cheese and pico... the perfect combo. Everything was real fresh, prep at the moment and real authentic flavors!!! The 2 ladies working there were real friendly and 100% customer service oriented.  I will definitely keep coming back!!! It's like eating straight out of a real Mexican bus on the west coast!!!
__label__5	The ice cream here is very delicious. They do have different flavors according to month or seasons but we were lucky to try the Nutella marshmallow. Inexpensive compared franchised ice cream spots.
__label__5	Great spot.  Great service.  Great food.  Happy to hear they're opening a spot closer to Los Angels!
__label__5	"Ace is the place!!!
haha, that is too funny, but no really, Joan and the team always do such a wonderful job with your clothes, and if you know me you know that clothes are extremely important to me! 

The beauty of this place is that they have one of the best tailors in the reno area that will be able to assist with all your alterations needs!! 

I'm glad there is such a good dry cleaners that is not overpriced like some of the other companies in the area."
__label__5	Amazing service at the bar! Becca is a an all star bartender! Becca if you see this, hi!
__label__5	"Super delicious! I really appreciate that the portion sizes are perfect. I got the deal where a salad, a starter, and a main combo costs $35 and it felt like a perfect amount of food for one person. 

The chicken fried trumpet mushrooms were my fave: so flavorful and the meaty texture of the mushrooms makes them perfect for deep frying. 

Menu said that they change things up frequently and I can't wait to come back!"
__label__5	"Gorgeous little shop that offers tiny desserts that pop with vibrant color and flavors.
They have core set of flavors that typically are also available and they mix in two to three seasonal flavors that will coincide with the time of year that visit.
The staff is cool, friendly and quick moving. Often you'll have to wait in a line to place your order but it works out because this will give you time to make your decision on what you want. 
If you want to see desserts that are little works of art and ready for their Instagram close up, visit the Macaron Bar today."
__label__5	Great mexican food. Huevos Rancheros was excellent. Good flavors, good healthy food selections also. Nicely decorated with their namesake mosaic tables. I've been here twice for lunch in the last two weeks and food was very good each time.
__label__5	120 different craft beers (usually in bottles, but occasional drafts), 86 whiskeys (most of them are Bourbon & Rye), great cocktails & mixed drinks.  It's super tiny, but if you come at the right time, you can still find it empty.  The staff works hard to help you figure out what you want to drink.
__label__5	Stumptown coffee and good vibes. Delectable caffinated flavors and hometown shop prices. Grab a cortado on ice and escape in the back alley garden. Clean, efficient, friendly. Will be back.
__label__5	"It's a simple great tasting quick burger. The fries compliment the food well,  nothing crazy, yet so much better than your average McDonald's meal. You can get a beer made by Brooklyn brewery,  a soda or an in house milkshake. 
I think there is an atmosphere here that's maintained by the staff - very friendly. It invites you to come back again. Excellent experience here at this small chain - stop in and grab a double shack burger!"
__label__5	"Really liked the cozy fire and casual seating.  We shared at the ""coffee table"" and chairs in front of the fire.  The decor was interesting and the view to the outside patio was very pretty.  The arugula, beet, & gorgonzola salad was very good as well as the spinach ricotta pizza.  The crab cake was good too.  The server was very friendly and attentive.  Sinatra music was a nice touch also. Was a great experience!"
__label__5	"So much love for this place. As soon as the door opens you've traveled across the Atlantic and you're in a Parisian bistro. The decor and vibe are on point. It's owned and staffed by a french family, son at the bar, mother serving tables and father preparing delicious authentic food. The wine is amazing and reasonably priced. 
Definitely worth checking out and I'll be back!"
__label__5	"A fab burger joint in Santa Barbara, they do their burgers right . They have the right mix of ""menu"" burgers and make your own, plus you can modify their ""menu"" versions which is what I did! This is a must stop whenever in Santa Barbara!"
__label__5	Hay man. This place are the bomb. Drinks be tasty AF, selection is nice,  atmosphere is cool. Laid back and chill, and stuff. Bartenders are really nice too. Jordan is the bomb!
__label__5	Best Turkish food in the area. I lived long years in Istanbul and whenever I come here. The eggplant kebab is amazing. Actually try everything with eggplants  I love this place.
__label__5	I always enjoy interesting ingredients and combinations that make up the menu. The menu rotates once in awhile and it speaks for their investment in the culinary experience of their patrons. I've been here multiple times and haven't had a bad experience with any menu item so far. Rooftop is pretty cool when it isn't hot outside. Waitstaff always seems to be pleasant.
__label__5	Hired them for a private event. there were no surprises. price was fair and no last minute changes. they were on time and delivered an excellent product for each menu item my guests selected. She was a lot of fun and personable as well. Great team to work with - Would hire them again in a heartbeat. Met our time constraint challenge easily and professionally
__label__5	AMAZING gelato! They have a wide variety of flavors and all of them have an AUTHENTIC gelato taste. Servings are pretty big and for a medium (4 flavors) it was almost $6 after tax. Definetly the best BANG FOR YOUR BUCK. To top it off it's on beach drive which is right on the water. Great vibes from this place.
__label__5	Soooo goood some of the best sushi everrrr. My friends loved ittttt. Got almost all there was to offer, not a bad one in the bunch!
__label__5	I've never been on a walking tour before and this one had definitely set a high bar.  Todd was awesome and very knowledgeable. I learned more about the hotel I was staying in than I could've learned anywhere else. Highly recommend the spirit tour!
__label__5	Love, love, love Art+Science. Everyone is friendly and knowledgeable, eager to accommodate changes in appointments. And Jack the masseuse is worth every penny!
__label__5	"Wonderful food, great service, AWESOME happy hour deals, you can't go wrong with Three Monkeys. I've never had their brunch but dinner & appetizers are worth the $! The Jungle Nachos are HUGE! I can't imagine eating them alone. 

A must go if you're in the area."
__label__5	King State has become are go to breakfast spot. They have great coffee and good eats. You can't go wrong with the bacon and eggs on a biscuit. If you haven't given the place a try I would suggest you do! Chill atmosphere ain't fancy it's kinda hipster but that's the area.
__label__5	What the heck this place is delicious. I got a slice of their quiche and a Guyana tea cake. Some of the best I have had. Everyone was super friendly and the service was quick. I'm definitely coming back!
__label__5	Great little hole in the wall for breakfast. Food was better than the pancake factory and biscuit heart which get all the hype.
__label__5	"I think it should have two $$ when it comes to cheese steaks but with that being said it really is a great cheese steak. My favorite ""go to"" steak place. For the life of me I cannot choose a cheese I like the best. Wiz = traditional ""Philly"" cheese; American = thier take on an american cheese sauce or Provolone = cheese greatness.
thank you for the whole pickled cherry peppers, I feel like I'm home in South Philly"
__label__5	Oh my goodness I love Fritz's. I grew up in Florissant and Fritzs was a huge part of my childhood. I have since moved to Florida but Fritzs is always at the top of list of places to stop when I visit MO. Fritzs sure is consistently awesome and delicious! My favorite treat the Razzmatazz which I enjoyed yesterday tastes exactly the same as it did when I was a kid. Florida sucks for frozen treats and I miss Fritz's!
__label__5	"They the best bang mi and steam bun to go. The noodle is oh so good. I usually go for the authentic beef pho, but one time I had the seafood pho and it was very yummy as well
Love this place!"
__label__5	All I gotta say is. YES YES SOUP DUMPLINGS. This is my go to dumpling spot in Philadelphia
__label__5	Don't let the exterior or interior keep you from some of the best food in Tucson!  The Birria Burrito is one big bundle of shredded beef bliss.  The Carne Seca Chimi a close second.  Thanks guys at Starr Pass for an awesome recommendation.  Definitely a keeper....and just possibly Tucson's best kept secret!
__label__5	While visiting my daughter at college and after seeing a movie, we were in the hunt for a light dinner.  Most restaurants in the area closed between 9-10.  As luck/fate would have it, this restaurant had decent reviews & was open till 1am (kitchen closes at midnight tho).  Best of all, it was in the same complex as my hotel (Sheraton Westport) and my daughter was going thru sushi withdrawal. All in all great experience and our server Sean was great!
__label__5	"Took my dog in, never going anywhere else again! Staff was welcoming and attentive to all our dogs needs! 
10/10 will recommend to all my family and friends!"
__label__5	I've stayed true to this place for years because my manicures and pedicures never come out as good anywhere else. I get dip powder for my hands and regular polish for my feet, and the job is always excellent and they have huge varieties of colors in many brands. The ladies who work here are pleasant and make sure that you're satisfied.
__label__5	Another note worthy place I love to stop in when I'm around it. Plus they give 10% discount to all gun permitted customers.
__label__5	Very good!  Exceptional flavor!  We were close so stopped in. Glad we did!  Will make sure we stop back!
__label__5	I loved this place.  The tortillas are the best I've had outside of Mexico.  Make sure you get ANYTHING with cheese because they have the BEST cheese of any Mexican place in the area.  WOW....the cheese is fantastic.  I will return next time I am in Santa Barbara. I see why Julia Child loved this place.
__label__5	"The wings here... 
My husband and I crave them. We get them for carry out when I don't feel like making dinner. It's dangerous that we live close here. Every time I go here, it is always packed and there's live music playing. This place is deceivingly bigger than it looks. I've been passed that area many times before going to ale emporium and I didn't even know it was there."
__label__5	The guys at Michael's have always been helpful. If I ever need a vehicle that I can afford that will work well, this is where I go!
__label__5	High tea here is quite the experience... the staff was very friendly, and the tiny sandwiches and tea flavors were spot on. Try strawberry and champagne tea, it's the best!
__label__5	Yum! My daughter wanted Sushi and we found this place on Yelp. Great, light environment and the sushi was wonderful! She had a California Roll and I had the red curry. I would definitely recommend this place and we will come back again!
__label__5	Hillmeade has been a great place to live! Incredibly welcoming, beautiful apartments and accommodating.
__label__5	This is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in the area. The vibe is relaxed and really nice; in the evenings they have salsa that is made at your table. It is fresh and very tasty. I have never had a bad meal here and in fact some of my favorite Mexican meals are from here, especially the enchiladas!
__label__5	I've been here twice to repair hail damage on different cars, and couldn't have been happier both times.  Cars come back looking brand new and was done right on time as promised.  Owner is the nicest guy.  If I ever have hail damage in future, I wouldn't even consider going anywhere else.
__label__5	First off, the vibe and style of the shop are amazing. All of the artists just have a kick ass attitude & work hard. They really listen to you and make sure you are comfortable and give you a great experience.  I see Midwest Rick and he's exceptional. You can't go wrong with this shop.
__label__5	It's best to go on off days/times, but this place is great. They have pretty much anything you could want and can provide a day's entertainment when you don't know what else to do.  We tend to go once every week or two to pick up produce and to wander around the stalls to see if anything catches our eye (honey?  fresh juice in interesting combinations? any type of food imaginable? spices? really, everything).  Just be ready to push your way through crowds and you'll be fine :)
__label__5	I love holiday inn it's the best hotel you can go there is one of this in Cincinnati Ohio and it is five stars and I love it
__label__5	Finally made it! All my nerd childhood dreams came true! Fun rotating beer selection. Super helpful and patient staff. And all the magical free games you could ever want. Now back to Street fighter!
__label__5	"Smart Park has been my choice  for airport parking for years!!  Making reservations ahead of time online is a plus.   I was even able to book my reservation today for same day travel!!
Great booth attendants...drivers are hospitable and kind. ..today I got to travel in one of the company's new vans/shuttles and it's great!!  My driver John was friendly and helpful!"
__label__5	Highly recommend this location of Any Lab Test Now.  Tuesday was very professional on so many levels - she greeted me with great kindness, answered all my questions, made recommendations, and her phlebotomy skills were spot on (not an easy task for a deep-vein person like me).
__label__5	If you want a quality NY bagel, then you HAVE to go to bagel joint! They have a great variety of bagels, cream cheese, and sandwiches! I recommend getting their early to get them hot & fresh! The owner is amazing and really makes the experience!
__label__5	Great food! Great service! And they have a vegan menu. This place rocks!
__label__5	Fast and through.  Johnny was available and quick.  I had a problem with a well line and he was able to come out and repair it quickly and efficiently.
__label__5	Stopped by for a quick happy hour so we bellied up to the bar and got the 2 for 1 Sangria, I had the white, very yummy! And they were quick to bring out our grilled octopus, which was hot and so delicious! Great, friendly service!
__label__5	Was in the area for a weekend and passed up a free breakfast so that we could go back to Blue  Moose again.  Top notch food, excellent and friendly service.  Very clean and cheerful.   If you are in the area you can't go wrong here whether you go for an omelet or some other item and the whipped cream that comes with most of the sweet breakfasts is one of the best that I have ever had.
__label__5	"I cannot say enough good. When we went vegan, we wondered what might be out there for us in terms of dining. This place rocks. My favorites? The Kimchi Rolls. I could eat two orders of these alone. But, I have had the burger, the mushroom Reuben, and several other dishes, deserts and drinks - all really good. If you are new to vegan or plant based eating, this is a great intro. If you are looking for good food, this also has it.

Give it a try!

Side note, parking has never been an issue. Not true for most of Nashville."
__label__5	"Eric is a patient, kind, considerate, caring, understanding, non-judge mental dog trainer/boarder. I call him the SB version of the Dog Whisperer. He's great with any dogs, but is really great with addressing behavioral issues, especially with aggressive, ""untrainable"" dogs. Eric is direct with people and their dogs so everyone can get along synergistically. If I had a puppy or dog with any kind of training issues, he'd be the first person I'd call."
__label__5	"Steak and cheese with portobello mushroom. Very very good. The prices are great! Every sandwich sounds and looks great. The selection in the bakery was great and looked amazing. Fast and friendly service. 
Thank you. I will be back for more."
__label__5	really good food and such nice hospitable people . starting to get a good following because it is such a wonderful area to bicycle in  as the go to place . today their peanut butter and jelly brownies were one of the best brownies I have ever had anywhere.
__label__5	Dr tao is great!  So is the office staff.  Made my root canal painless... with that said I hope I never have to see them again
__label__5	My new favorite spot! Can not wait to explore the menu. Their service and quality of food are both top notch. You will not be disappointed!!
__label__5	"Awesome food! 
A real diner is hard to come by in Delaware, but here it is open 24/7 (minus covid restrictions).
The cheesecake is homemade and is AMAZING.
Love getting breakfast here or getting take out."
__label__5	"SUCH a cute cafe and really great coffee. There was plenty of place to sit inside and a few tables outside. 

I ordered an iced almond milk latte and it had a really great caramel-y nutt-y flavor to it. I loved it! I wish it were closer to where I lived because I would go back all the time.

I did not try the food but the muffins looked awesome."
__label__5	I would highly recommend this company. They work as a team, and they are mobile. They were able to tint my vehicle in less than one hour at my job. Exceptional quality and professionalism. They also have an extensive selection of choices to choose from to suit all needs. If you need fast, convenient, and reliable service give these guys a try. Check out there Facebook also as it has coupons on occasion.
__label__5	"The Bachelor Boys Band is phenomenal. From the time we first contacted them through our wedding day, our experience could not have been better. They are a pleasure to work with and incredibly talented. One of the compliments we receive most frequently about our wedding is that ""the band was amazing."" If I had to plan my wedding all over again, I would choose them in a heartbeat."
__label__5	Came to happy hour here last week and sat at the bar! Dana was the bartender and was so attentive and had a great personality and made great recommendations! She suggested the Cajun pasta and Long Island iced tea and both were amazing! Will be returning and requesting Dana! Great job Friday's!
__label__5	I've used Mother and Sons 5 times so far. They have also moved my family members. They are incredible movers. Jonathon is the best at packing and time management. He makes sure our move always run smooth. The other guys listen to him and don't dilly dally at all. The owner, Gloria is such a sweetheart. She always there ready to accommodate any requests I have. Her prices are great. After our third move I no longer call a bunch of movers to get quotes. Gloria's  work ethic, dependability and great prices prove that she is the best.
__label__5	I recommend Nifty Nails to all of my friends - there is no better place in Indy to get your nails done. (Actually, I've lived in several different cities and this is by far the best place I've visited.) At the risk of losing my ability to get appointments, Vicky is the most talented technician I've ever experienced. My nails are flawless every single time - and I'm very picky about how my cuticles look! You will not find a better manicure!!
__label__5	Great cozy place in Indianapolis.   Scratch kitchen everything made uniquely for you and sourced locally.   My wife had the Boar Bolognese which I grabbed a bite from.  Amazing home made noodles.   I ordered the seared chicken - fresh great tasting blueberries made it super unique.  Make sure to get the donuts for dessert! Can't wait to come back.
__label__5	"Abeyta painting is the best!  We are so... glad to have found them for painting the interior of our Oro Valley home.  Looks beautiful.  Done on time and to estimate.  They did special work on fireplace ""brass"" trim to spray paint with fireproof flat black to match our decor.  We recommend them to all of our friends and neighbors."
__label__5	Very convenient and easy access. I've been a customer for over a year and I am very happy with the service.
__label__5	woot woot,  always good burritos my family and I came from California and needed a quick bite. So as Californians we went for burritos and they were amazing!
__label__5	So much fun! We had a large group of people there(30-40) and they had tables reserved for us. We had brought in snacks, drinks and had pizza delivered. The games were fun. The place was completely packed but I didn't have a problem getting a drink at either the front bar or the back bar. I only had male bartenders so I can't speak to any negative experience from the two female bartenders mentioned in the other reviews. I loved this place so much I've already messaged them for details about hosting a birthday party there in a few months.
__label__5	A bit overwhelming for those that choose to make the endeavor on Sundays and Mondays. Patience is required for those that drive as there is frequently a line of cars waiting to enter the parking lot. The store is relatively well staffed and well stocked despite how busy it gets. It has the typical Trader Joe's goodies with the exception of alcohol due to PA beer and alcohol laws. I like how they have miniaturized the number of check out lanes a while back that allows for the line around the store for checkout to go relatively quick.
__label__5	I got an eyebrow wax and tint from the new L & R Beauty Bar. I never thought my eyebrows could look this good. I was really nervous about the color, shape etc, but I've come to realize that everyone at Lux and Roses is a true artist! I feel so pretty and confident, and definitely happy that I don't have to fill mine in anymore. Anyone on the fence about a brow tint-- do it!
__label__5	"this was my first time at this nail spa & i am obsessed with it! 
i made an appointment online (which i would recommend!) and they sat me right away!
the staff was very friendly and helpful. i told my nail tech to ""freestyle"" it and i am obsessed with the results!! eric was absolutely amazing and was very talented! 
i will absolutely come here again!! love it!"
__label__5	Got a groupon for an interior detailing.  Paid for an exterior and got a great deal on that while my car was there.  Car looked spectacular on the inside and great the outside.  They were even nice about me showing up late (They were technically closed) for pickup.  Friendly and well priced.  I recommend them.
__label__5	The Barnes is one of my favorite museums. Just one phenomenal painting after another. Have been there twice and love it. They have an app that's helpful, but it is limited in scope and you cannot speed up the speaker's pace. Regardless, an awesome collection in a fantastic setting.
__label__5	Food is amazing and the prices are great for what you get. Coconut shrimp dinner is wow. Cool vibe and the music is super chill. Perfect beach bar. First time here and can't wait to come back.
__label__5	Goes without saying that the lamb burgers are amazing... great restaurant, amazing service and fantastic food. Definitely a place to visit more than once.
__label__5	Saw 'What I learned in Paris' and the play was awesome.  The venue is amazing in architecture. And ambiance.  The actors are very talented and the play kept you on the edge of your seat.
__label__5	I've ordered from here a few times and I will say that Taste of Persia's food is AMAZING! The customer service is wholesome and family oriented. It's a very quaint, and cozy restaurant. I personally recommend the khoobideh kabob, but honestly you won't go wrong with whatever you choose! Definitely will be back!!
__label__5	"Excellent quaint old school diner ! Food and service is fantastic, portions are huge and delicious. We will be back. They also serve ""lunch menu"" for breakfast. One of the best roast beef sandwiches I've ever had (with nacho cheese!). Mama loved the gyro and feta omelette ! Awesome tots too !"
__label__5	I have been coming to little Anthony's for many years. Have always loved the classic menus items but am so happy about their new menu items. Also nothing wrong with getting a tasty milkshake after a meal!!
__label__5	"Sinus infection on vacation - dealt with fast. 

No wait. 
Howard was fast but caring. 
Clean. 
Modern. 

Pay by credit card- you can submit to your insurance later. 
One block from the cvs where my prescription was sent. 

Took Uber here from our beachfront Redington hotel- quick trip. 

Hands down the fastest doc visit of my life- but in the very best way possible. 

If we lived locally- this would be my absolute go-to urgent care."
__label__5	This place had really good back massagers! But I don't think it's a very family friendly place. I would 10/10 come back for another free back massage from the shabari hand wand.
__label__5	Lived this restaurant. From the moment we walked in we were greeting with elegant hospitality. Robert and Anne Marie were fabulous. The pork loin with dirty rice and the duck fish wonderful.  The egg shell foam between meals extraordinary
__label__5	Boise Mac Repair provides great service and are super helpful. My computer was having a problem of shutting down unexpectedly and they fixed it on the spot and sent me on my way with no charge. In addition they provided some extra Mac advice! Highly recommend.
__label__5	Called first thing Monday morning for someone to come out to take a look at our heater. They answered the phone right away and responded within 2 hours. Reasonably priced and professional. Definitely recommend.
__label__5	"Love this place...totally unpretentious, neighborhood watering hole with a solid choice of menu items.  A rotating selection of micro brews to keep you on your toes.

The staff is friendly, attentive and our food always shows up fast.  hot and yummy.  French dip, Guiness pie..Irish nachos...not to mention the the fish and chips  ..wedge salad...

Enough...I am going there now."
__label__5	The doctors and staff at Idaho Eyecare Center are top notch! Everyone is very friendly and welcoming, and they immediately put you at ease.  My recent appointment started right on time and I was in and out in less than 45 minutes, which including a pre-exam eye screening, the exam, choosing a new pair of frames and lenses, and taking care of insurance/payment. I highly recommend Idaho Eyecare Center!
__label__5	This place is soooo delicious!! The ribs were melting off the bone and super hot. It was $18 and it's a huge plate. It's basically a full rack of ribs. The sushi was so fresh and tasty. The waitress was really good and sweet.
__label__5	"This was my first experience eating here & definitely won't be my last! The food, atmosphere, and service were all amazing! Finally found authentic and great Thai food in Carrollwood.

We ordered the potstickers for an app, then the spicy beef soup, which was outstanding, and finally the massaman curry as the entree. The massaman was incredible!! I got it with medium heat and it had a little kick but not too much.

I cant wait to go on my second visit and try other great items. If you are in Carrollwood this is a must try!"
__label__5	Best dinner my boyfriend and I have had in a long long time!! Everything was absolutely delicious. We had a LivingSocial deal, and since neither of us had ever eaten there we asked the manager, Raj, to order for use. I've worked in several restaurants and learned the people who worked there know, always know the best dishes. Raj ordered us the BEST meal, which included garlic naan, vegetable chau cahu, and my personal favorite chicken makhani. We will definitely be back, and we will be telling our friends and family to go. Definitely a new treasure of Boise!!
__label__5	I love bingo pizza. Great food at a great price. Also I have been back in the kitchen area and it is one of the cleanest kitchens I have ever seen.
__label__5	Beautiful hotel and great service. Nice bar inside and small indoor swimming pool. No free breakfast, which I found disappointing but the grille across the street is yummy. Love the modern decor. Overall, I highly recommend!
__label__5	"This is a great addition to the area! New Orleans doesn't have a bagel scene-but Goldberg's fills that empty carb hole. I love that they have a bunch of different bagel flavors and an interesting assortment of flavored cream cheeses. Their veggie cream cheese on a jalapeño cheddar bagel ($3.50ish)...mmmm! 

There is a take out section to the left and a pretty big dine-in area to the right. Overall, a solid and much needed bagel place in New Orleans."
__label__5	"I was visiting here from NY for a family reunion, I never received such good hospitality and warm energy in a hotel before. 

-the happy hour didn't hurt either! I will definitely be back."
__label__5	The Rita's treat team is awesome. The custard is so light and different than any other custard I've ever tried. It kinda reminds me of a mousse. What I like best about the ice is that the fruit flavors have real fruit in them. Thank you to the owner for not only serving his country, but also returning to his roots to serve Northwest Reno!
__label__5	Live way too close to this place. Best neighborhood bar on the planet. One word: MUSSELS. I can't get enough of their mussels, specifically the red diablo ones. In all honesty though, everything I have had on their menu is great (except for the nachos, need more stuff). Outdoor seating is great, and the beer list is always changing. Will miss having this as my local bar, once I move out of the city!
__label__5	The family recently took the Holiday Sampler class which included glass blowing, bead making in the flamework area, and some cold work for the kiln.  We knew nothing about any of these and had an incredible, positive experience, while getting a very hands-on introduction to this type of art.  We each have five unique and personal items from the experience, and it was a great way to spend the day with family.  Instructors are very helpful, but not overbearing, and the facility contains a gallery with items for sale and venue space available for small or larger events - very cool.
__label__5	Fabulous wines, wonderful customer service. Go here for a lovely wine tasting experience. You will really enjoy it.
__label__5	Sooooo Goooood. Go early and order the tugboat and coffee. Best brunch!
__label__5	I like the burrito and enchilada combo that I get there. I get it with chicken meat. My mom gets the tacos, or a Chile rello and cheese enchilada. We love it. It's some of the best Mexican food that I eat. I don't like the salads that come in the combos because they don't taste right or something.
__label__5	Amazing job on detailing my car after it was stolen.  They spent a lot of time and care on the inside of the car knowing drugs were used in it leaving a harmful residue all over the interior.  I ended up with a car I could safely put my son in.  Thanks for doing such a great job!
__label__5	One of my favorite breakfast spots in Tucson. Thier egg benedicts are great. I usually order the weekend special Benedict. The Yosemite Sam bloody Mary is one of the better ones in town. Expect a wait on the weekend. The outdoor patio is also nice depending on the weather.
__label__5	Dr. Marin was great! I went for a consultation and he has able to take care of my procedure pretty quickly that same day. I was shocked because I was expecting to have to come back for several visits. All the staff was super nice. Best dental experience ever! I highly recommend.
__label__5	Bonner's did a wonderful job hosting a post funeral luncheon for all of our family and friends this past week. The food was delicious, service was wonderful and the overall ambiance was warm and welcoming. The staff did a great job accommodating such a large party and made sure the food and drinks kept coming. Definitely would recommend Bonner's again for another event or a place to have a neighborhood gathering. Thank you again!
__label__5	Let me tell you, I spent months searching for a motorhome. I checked out Leisureland RV Center's website and was impressed with their pricing so I stopped by and met the salesperson Russell Yates. These guys are easy-going, honest people. Their pricing is straightforward. I couldn't find any better deal for this newer model low mileage unit they had. I'm really happy with the experience and would recommend them to anyone.
__label__5	We have nothing but good things to say about our evening at Cadiz! Messina was on top of everything,helping our party of 12 with a graduation dinner! We couldn't have asked for anything better, from the seating which made us feel like we were right in our own home, apps, drinks, a great dinner & dessert. Very accommodating. A truly memorable evening!
__label__5	Favorite workout, favorite community. If you're looking for a place to feel comfortable, have a great workout, and have fun - come to cycle bar the gulch!!
__label__5	Went to chihuly in the dark. It was very beautiful. Pretty crowded but it was still very enjoyable. Perfect for a date very good atmosphere.
__label__5	IT is a Wonderful place ! By ocean .service is good , food is better! Love the mimosa flight! Will be back for sure!
__label__5	Great Coffee. A very unique vibe when compared to the trend of the rising insta-worthy coffee shops. Sticking true to a type of Mississippi River - New Orleans - gothic vibe, but doing it really well. The owner has indefinitely confined himself to having an amazing beard by integrating it with the shop's marketing. His beard lives up to the legend. Dope. Amazing espresso. I believe they've received national recognition for their espresso. Regular V60 coffee is really great as well. If you're in St. Louis, you've gotta stop in and experience Sump.
__label__5	Five star five star I love this place I had a computer module for complicated rowing machine that they thought it couldn't be repaired and couldn't be replaced he fixed it perfectly in just a few minutes I'm so happy there are many people like this left in the world A real craftsman honest person helping people solve problems thank you
__label__5	Super friendly service and a very attentive manager - who frequently communicates with her staff and her customers - really made this rare visit to Wendy's stand out for us. Food was fresh, hot, and tasty. Restaurant was clean clean clean, and I am a germophobe so I notice little things - nothing even close to dirty here. I look forward to returning.
__label__5	Blueberry and cranberry scones were outstanding . LeBuzz cookie was the bomb  I also tried the American in Paris breakfast sandwich. That was also good. Staff were friendly and helpful. The place was clean.
__label__5	"I'm very happy with Henry's!  The restaurant is very clean, the employees are nice and the food is delicious!  Very authentic Chicago style food. 

I definitely recommend their Italian beef. It's so good and flavorful.   You won't be disappointed so if you've never had it you've got to try it!!"
__label__5	Love this place.  As a female I can pull up outside at one of the bays, and the guys come out and put air in my tires for free!  Of course I tip them and they love that!
__label__5	Customer service was great today, thanks to the girl working the counter. I called ahead to make an order to take to a client. She had everything done quickly, and put all the plates napkins & plastic cups in a bag . I was very impressed with the service!
__label__5	Excellent place for families! Huge servings and affordable prices. The shrimp fajitas were fresh and delicious. My husband ordered the Quesadilla Suprema and loved it. My children enjoyed the chicken fingers and rice and beans. We will absolutely be back.
__label__5	From my best food , very friendly , not touristic, if you are looking for a place where the people of New Orleans eat and good drink ,it's the restaurant you should go too !!
__label__5	LOOOOVE this place!!! Good popcorn at a convenient price! Popcorn is warm and you can smell them popping it in the store so you know it's fresh as well
__label__5	I'm enjoying some wine at DV8 decided I need something to munch on how about a grilled cheese sandwich from brass Bear talk about comfort food the staff was helpful they even brought it over to The tasting room. Thanks for everything see you soon
__label__5	My daughters and I love this place!! Great food. And the staff there are amazing makes us feel like we are just hanging with  for dinner!!
__label__5	I had a great experience with Land Rover Willow Grove. Todd, George and Kim were very helpful. I got great service and a great vehicle at a great price. Thank you!
__label__5	When I visit here I feel like I am back in England. The menu is fantastic. Everyone should check this chip shop about at least once.
__label__5	Love love love this venue and the various jazz group we heard here! Outdoor venue was lovely! Such talent! The beignets are a must.
__label__5	I love the staff at this hotel. The proximity to historical locations and the nearest restaurants (which are incredibly close) are fantastic. The staff cares about their guests. Arvel hall, manager of guest services, is a genuinely nice person who will make your time here the best in philly.. Van drivers to and from the airport are also wonderful. They are friendly and excited to welcome you to their hotel.
__label__5	The meal was delicious, and the service was very fast even with the long line.  The cheddar bacon hot dog was a little undersized, but had great flavor.  The chilli cheese fries and Chicago combo were spot on and just amazing.  I wish that it was closer, as it is a little bit of a hike from Lakeland.  Can't wait to come back.
__label__5	"Dr. Aryan Mazloom is extremely receptive to your concerns and is overall a great dentist. I'm scared of dentists because of bad experiences in the past but Dr. Mazloom makes me comfortable. The whole procedure (I had some fillings) was totally painless. They were very upfront with the costs, so no surprises at all. 
An amazing dentist, I'd readily recommend them to anyone. A great local place."
__label__5	"Great place for great tattoos 
I would have to say it is worth checking out for anyone looking for any type of work done! Black and grey / traditional / Japanese / tribal/ yoga/ nerd/ what ever u want they got !"
__label__5	Worth the wait!! From the minute we were seated service was exceptional coffee guy sorry didn't get is name always made sure you had a full hot cup. Our waiter Dominic was amazing ! Now let's get to the food delicious huge portions  everyone took some home  Do not miss the chance to eat great food in a great atmosphere with 5 star service!! Love this place. Please open one in Jacksonville
__label__5	Great bookstore! Great deals! I really like this place, the employees are pretty awesome. Definitely go here if you havnt!
__label__5	Love the choices they have here. So hard to find somewhere that has healthy options. I had the quinoa salad with chicken. Very fresh and the chicken was delicious with this salad. My husband got the SC burger and fries and raved about it. It's a small restaurant but they have tables outside in shade.  Try it!  You won't regret it.
__label__5	It was pink and bright and girly and fantastic!  the girls at the counter were super helpful, and they called me darling :)
__label__5	Great food! Excellent service!  The seafood pancake was amazing! Serving were plentiful and full of flavor! Give it a try, you will love it!
__label__5	First time at Two Chicks and we are already looking forward to going back. Great service, food and ambiance! (The country gravy is seriously so yummy.)
__label__5	My dogs have been going to Dr. Dorner and Dr. Esposito for years. Now that they are elderly, I have been coming in much more frequently. I highly recommend this vet clinic and I trust them 100% with the care of my furry family. The staff and doctors are friendly, compassionate, knowledgable, and professional. I will be forever grateful for the excellent services we have received here.
__label__5	Stopped in to just grab a quick salad to go. Had this fabulous salad with sausage, brisket, and fried jalapeños. One of the best salads I have had. Can't wait to stop back in.
__label__5	"Wonderful.  We were
 In a hurry to make a movie, and they respected that while providing their usual deli cious food."
__label__5	"NOOOO!!! My remaining go to thin crust pizza joint has closed!

I'm bummed.

I had many good pies from you guys. I was going to order one tonight! Glad I got one a couple weeks ago."
__label__5	This is another Home-Town family owned place that's far superior to the typical Corporate fare.  Sometimes they do have Ribeyes, we asked for and got two of the greatest Ribeyes I've ever had.  Shannon was a fabulous, friendly and extremely efficient (without being overbearing) server.  I used to go here a lot in the 90s and moved away, now returned and definitely putting Silver Saddle back on my list of favorites.
__label__5	Just rode with Justin and he was hilarious and so insightful!!!! Really appreciated the background and cultural details.
__label__5	If you need a break from all the rich creole food this is the perfect spot. I love the cat fish plate the felafel plate. Their hummus is on point. The food is fresh and tasty. Prices are reasonable. If Mona's closed I think I might cry or at least tear up.
__label__5	"I had some really expensive cheese - it smelled like cows. 

there were mustaches 

and plaid.   and wingtips.       Hops and bourbon tint the raw wood bench seating. 

Irony and tattoos.    Money spent."
__label__5	I walked in on a Tuesday night for happy hour and was immediately greeted by The bartender, Kylin. I asked for a recommendation on a cocktail and he suggested her spin on an old fashion. It was delicious and I was thoroughly impressed. I am new in town and she was very knowledgable about the area as well as the menu. I had the Fra Diavlo Mussels on her recommendation and they were delicious as well! On top of everything, she had an amazing smile that made me want to come back next Tuesday. I highly recommend going to Salu and seeing Kylin on Tuesday nights!
__label__5	Our first Food Impression in Indianapolis is a hit...delicious!!! Maria is friendliest and knowledgeable  and the atmosphere is excellent. I am not a great writer. Sorry. Even the crazy hostess whose comments she deleted was very friendly. Yes...eat here!!!!!
__label__5	Ladies when you want extremely good nail art and Pedi's or manicures whatever you like Go to Lana at Lucky Nails
__label__5	"I can't rave enough about this place!    The workers are all so friendly and I'm obsessed with the Coke freestyle machine.    The food is always delicious, and the bar drinks are pretty yummy


The only thing that sucks is when the college kids are in there like they own the place and take up the whole bar area and you can barley get to the drink machine."
__label__5	Hometown club.  It is always very clean.  Everyone is super nice and knowledgeable. The manager, Pat, is a rockstar. You can feel the positive energy of the staff the moment you walk in.
__label__5	Had an amazing meal and experience at Tableau! I booked a reservation for a large group a few months in advance. When we got there we were taken to an awesome private area for our group. Our server Josh was amazing and so friendly, he made our night! The group sampled many different items and everything was delicious. A complimentary dessert was also brought out for the bride. I would love to come back next time I'm in New Orleans!
__label__5	Burgers are good, hot chicken sandwich is great, fries are a tad greasy, get the garlic aioli, the milkshakes are delicious but very rich and filling
__label__5	I had Steve come out this morning to fix my truck, which wouldn't start.  I called at 7:15 this morning and he was there by 9:30, diagnosed the truck by 10, picked up parts by 10:30, and my truck was running by 11:00.  Charged for parts, diagnosis and 1 hour labor.  Excellent service...he was very pleasant and professional.  I'll be calling again next time I need repairs!  Very impressed!
__label__5	I had the original Palestine and it was GREAT.  I also had an angioste salad and that was fantastic also!!
__label__5	Looking for a nice and quiet coffee spot ? The place is perfect. The coffee was great and so was the vibe.
__label__5	Best fried chicken I've had in a long time.  Fried green tomatoes were good too!  But the banana pudding was out of this world.  I'll definitely be eating there again next time I'm in Nashville!
__label__5	"There's no shortage of great Mexican joints in South Philly, so what makes this newcomer a standout?

Beautifully bright ingredients!

If you're looking for throw-down tacos soaked in greasy chorizo or a burrito the size of a newborn, this isn't the place. 

But if you're looking for lighter fare Mexican dishes, thoughtfully prepared with fresh ingredients - try it out. And grab a few rounds of tequila from their surprisingly extensive tequila menu. 

Great outdoor seating on a low-traffic corner, and delicious food. Can't wait to get back."
__label__5	Great place to get something basic or special and then when you get bored of your outfit, you just bring it back and get store credit. Awesome!
__label__5	I brought an old faucet valve stem that was damaged and difficult to work with hoping they'd have a replacement. They did not, but the young man behind the counter spent about 30 minutes working on it. He cleaned it up, sanded it down, put a new rubber bushing on the end and new screw and it was good as new! They could have just turned me away but no, they took their time and fixed it while barely charging me a thing. Would highly recommend these guys!!!
__label__5	One of most underrated kitchens in Indy.  Quirky menu with a focus on breakfast and unique preparations of pork products.  It's an excellent option to break away from the usual burger, taco, pizza, etc. options.
__label__5	We had to go back more than once.  There is a reason this is in the Top 100 brunch places in the US.  Highly recommend the pecan French toast, crab Oscar Bennie, Bennie omelet, Oscar omelet, Cali omelet just all the things!!!   Pic is from the first trip.  Some very happy peeps.  Service was great, too!
__label__5	Hands down the BEST cheesesteak hoagie I've ever eaten and my husband said his supreme calzone was the best he's ever had. Even our 16 month old loved both. And the driver couldn't find the place we're staying so the manager called my phone 6 times before I could answer and then delivered it himself. Most places would've called once and if you didn't answer they would have just said forget it and charged you without getting your food. Definitely remembering this for future reference whenever we a we are in Nashville. I'm saving the number in my phone.
__label__5	I had fried chicken wings, loaded potato salad and banana pudding. It was all delicious. The fried chicken was well cooked and crispy. The banana pudding is from scratch so no artificial banana flavoring bs. The loaded potato salad was also good my first time having it. Staff very friendly and knowledgeable as well.
__label__5	"I was initially intending to go to Danny's All - American Diner, which is just down the road from Taco Bus on Falkenburg, because I heard about it from Guy Fieri's show on Food Network ""Diners, Drive-ins,  and Dives"", but they were closed. So someone at Danny's, who I believe was Danny himself, recommended we try Taco Bus down the road, which was also on the show. We went there and I ordered the Chicken Quesadilla and it was some of the best Mexican food I have ever tasted!"
__label__5	Awesome experience. Extremely nice staff from the Front Office to the Dentist. I had cracked a existing crown, and like many people, have a very busy schedule. It was so convenient to have the old crown removed and new crown installed on the very same day.......and at a very affordable price. I will never have a crown installed the old fashioned way again; get fitted for the crown, have a temporary installed (which may or may not last) and then schedule another appointment for the final crown to be fitted and installed......extremely happy with my decision.
__label__5	"Stayed here about a month ago. Very clean. Super nice people and a lot of fun things to do at the hotel. Parking is easy and getting around U of A was really easy from here. The pricing is fairly good too! Don't forget to stop by the bar. 
We will be staying there again."
__label__5	Tummy satisfied! Service was great, our server was very quick in taking our order and coming out with the food. We got the chicken wings, pho, porkchop special, and durian shake which is a must if you like durian. Food was delicious! I have yet to try the bun bo hue and banh beo. Will definitely be returning to satisfy my Vietnamese cravings!
__label__5	I don't know why this place only has 3 stars! I go to this place regularly. It looks a bit dodgy, but the customer service is incredible. The people on the floor are super helpful and the cashiers are always SUPER nice. If you go, ask for Peter. He is very knowledgeable and will help you find exactly what you need while introducing you to something you haven't tried, but will absolutely love. I have never had a bad experience here.
__label__5	"Happy Tuesday to all!!! Jeanine and Jana r the BEST!!!! They r always willing to help resolve issues
when brought to their attention... They help provide 
a nice and inclusive living environment!!!
Thank u ladies please keep up the good work!!!

__label__5	Visited St. Pete this week from LA, found this awesome coffee while looking for anyplace serving Bulletproof coffee on Yelp. Fantastic Bulletproof! My husband and I went every day for a solid week, that's how good it was. Not only that, great service by the owners, Matt and Halsey. They also serve pastries made right there in-house - try the apple cinnamon muffin, its to die for. Definitely will be returning next time we're in town.
__label__5	I've been coming here for more than 20 years it has always been great. The service is great you will have your empire rolls before you even can check in. I would have pictures but my meal can so quickly.
__label__5	Giving 5 stars for excellent service. Stopped by for a quick snack while waiting on my hotel room. The server, Rachel, could not have been more accommodating with an Instant greeting, kept checking on everything, and was so upbeat and positive. Also have to commend Jake, food runner and apparently master door greeter. He was so helpful with his recommendations. So nice to see a pleasant and polite young man.
__label__5	"Courteous, quick, & kind. 

They're a cash only emissions & inspection place so keep that in mind if you're heading on over! I gave them a call before doing the drive over & they told me to bring it on. Haha."
__label__5	I was housesitting for a friend and a gutter that had come loose was creating reverse flow.  And they came out and in five minutes had a loose gutter that was causing some flooding challenges back up and working. Terrific!
__label__5	This place was chosen by our local host for a casual business dinner. What a wonderful reflection on local food and fine preparation. The quality was demonstrated through all the orders from the dozen of us.  We ended up sharing bites and having a delightful evening enjoying classics of New Orleans.
__label__5	Came for besties birthday brunch and enjoyed mimosas with chicken biscuit and egg sandwich. The ambiance is very laid back and the service was very friendly and fast! The service staff delivered excellent customer service and made out first time dining at Pinewood Social memorable. There's a bowling alley in the back which is so cool and a bar at the entrance. We later found out at night the place gets pretty lively and is the hangout spot in Nashville. Check out Pinewood Social when in Nashville and you will be blown away on how delicious the food tastes and experience the difference.
__label__5	This place is so dope. Ask for Jane, or fingers crossed you get her as your server - she's the bomb! She'll recommend all the best drink and food specials. Awesome place & great food!
__label__5	"We were on a hunt to de-stress after the holidays and a pedicure was just the ticket. Made a call to inquire on pricing and how quickly we could get in and drove over immediately.

The salon has a relaxing, soothing look to it. The chairs are a soft pretty blue and the walls are white which makes it all appear very clean and ~ again ~ soothing. 

Pedicures done for my guy and me and we walked out of there knowing we'll be coming back to this location soon."
__label__5	Dr. Monroe and her staff are friendly and caring. We've taken our pets to her practice for years and will continue. I most appreciate Dr.Montor's willingness time listen and answer all your questions. I never feel rushed. She is always sure to make sure you get a full estimate of the diagnostic plan so you aren't surprised when you check out. I always appreciate that.
__label__5	First time hitting them up and I was not dissapointed, I enjoyed the food and the total was not bad either.  I highly recommend this spot!!
__label__5	A place with open doors to the sinners like me. I am drawn here everyday I visit the Quarter!!
__label__5	This is one of my favorite Tampa restaurants! Great food, ambiance and service! Must try the okra fries and the native chili! Omg!!
__label__5	Jessica did an awesome job fixing a bad set I had put on prior. I had an awesome pedicure also. I will definitely be back!
__label__5	I was pleasantly surprised! The smell took a little while to get use to,  I guess because I'm not use to brewreys... went for lunch and it was GOOD! I had the chubby burger
__label__5	"Incredible burgers. Chicago's Best Burgers is one of Tampa's best kept secrets - nestled away in Brandon. I spend some days dreaming about having one, to be honest.

It has mom and pop written all over it and the food is delicious. You'll spend about $10-$12 on average, but it's worth it. They use grass-fed beef according to the management.

Try the truffle fries and make sure to get some bacon jam with your burger!"
__label__5	"Yum, yum, yum! Fun, fun fun.  We just got off an early morning flight and were famished.   Found Lenny's on yelp and decided to give it a go.  We were there during the spring training season so the restaurant was packed.  We gave our name and it was a 20 minute wait.  Surpringly they sat us a less than 10 minutes.  The food was delicious and plenty.  The menu is huge with lots of choices.  My 5 yo really enjoyed her Winky Eggs!

The balloon man Mike was a hit with the kids and kept my three kids entertained."
__label__5	Excellent! Easy ordering and curbside pickup during the times of Covid. Highly recommend. Beautiful, fresh and delicious!
__label__5	Ben is courteous, professional and reasonably priced. I recommend BA Locksmith & Security.
__label__5	This is the clothing line of Allie Burguieres, which is a whimsical artist of animals. (She's also a possum rehabber). Sure a local artist and has several different stores for her art; in this one are her t-shorts, tank tops, etc. I love her art. I love the whimsy, the sweetness but yet mixed with a innocent attitude.
__label__5	This tiny coffee shop is my favorite in st.pete. It is far from most other parts and not terribly walkable, but has a nice ambiance. My favorite drink there is the dirty chai.
__label__5	Emotional journey through time . Highly educational experience would reccomend a few hours dedicated to exploring this museum.  Very busy on weekends would definitely visit again .
__label__5	A sprinkler pipe busted on a mid day Saturday. I immediately called Pink Plumber and explain the urgency of our situation. There are gallons of water spilling out by the minute. Pink plumber immediately send someone over and in a couple of hours everything was resolved. Now I have them on speed dial and case I have a future Plumbing emergency.
__label__5	I live in California, everytime i go see my little brother...I GO HERE and multiple times! Great people, great food, great prices!!!! Simply Awesome!!!
__label__5	It's true. At Gus' you can get a hot dog wrapped up inside a hot pretzel stick. You can't go wrong with that combo. Make the trip. Buy the special mustard. You'll go back again and again.
__label__5	Seriously delicious!  Americano was smooth and bold.  Wake up crepe with turkey was insane and very friendly service!  Next time we come back to Nashville it's a must visit!
__label__5	"Everyone has said it. ""The Bobbie"" wins. Their sandwiches are DELICIOUS. But the staff..


... are miserable. I'm telling you, the only people more miserable are the folks over at the DMV. Get your food, smile, and peace out."
__label__5	Great lunch visit!! Fast friendly service, lots of salad and sandwich menu options, nice outdoor seating area!! My husband and I both enjoyed a yummy salad. We will certainly be back again!
__label__5	I came in just to check things out, because we were already so full, but when i took a spoonful of my sisters mind chocolate chip ice cream, it was the most refreshing thing i've ever had for dessert. I ended up going and getting my own cup! Its a little pricey for ice cream, but you will be 100% satisfied with EVERY SINGLE BITE!!
__label__5	Fantastic buying experience throughout. Friendly, knowledgeable staff and great pricing. Good selection of accessories.
__label__5	Great place love it,    love it,   love it all the sexy stuff for woman  to be sexy for your man or even for your self, come and shop  here in the heart   of the beautiful  Santa barbara
__label__5	So I am kind of obsessed with this place. The food is super fresh, the seasonings are phenomenal, and the veggie assortments are awesome. I've gone like 4 times in 3 weeks and still haven't made it past the dolsot bibimbap. The only thing they're missing is kimchi jjigae!!
__label__5	The most Dankkkkkkk Craft Beer spot in Sparks (and it's not even close).  I started coming to the Tavern for their dart night and fell in love with the spot.  Their revolving beer menu is extraordinary and I have enjoyed more legit beers here than any place.  The staff is super cool and insightful about paring beers you like with new beers you have never tried.  If you want to try a new beer, meet new people and maybe throw some darts or gamble in peace come to the Tavern!
__label__5	Great food. Nice ppl. I love hard to find spots and this is real food. No Jack n a Crack or McDonald's
__label__5	"Awesome and always spectacular! Deli, smoothies. And of course all the organic produce you can imagine!!! Been coming here since it opened. Staff is super informative and always have a smile!
I go every other day lol! So I'd know"
__label__5	Loved this place for ribs which I don't eat very often!  The sides were so, so good too.  My husband and I shared scalloped potatoes and cole slaw.  I highly recommend this restaurant even though you do have to go through a line and choose your food.  The tastiness of the food fully made this place a must while visiting St. Louis!!!
__label__5	By far, my best dining experience in New Orleans.  The food here is as good as it gets.  I had a salmon special that was cooked to perfection.  Great ambience and very romantic.  For dessert we shared the Salty Malty Ice Cream Pie which has a pretzel crust and caramel whipped cream - it was simply divine.  I would have liked to have dined here again during our stay in NOLA as there were other entrees and appetizers I wanted to try.  Reservations are highly recommended.
__label__5	This place is awesome! Great beer! Great staff! Large ipa selection which is what I like. Also has good vegan and veggie menu options for bar food.  Average cost for drinks and food together is around 25-30 dollars. The flights are slightly expensive at 20 dollars but worth it if it is your first time here.
__label__5	Best Indian food I've ever had, plus the staff are incredible. Super friendly and eager to discuss their food with even the most clueless of white people, such as myself and my elderly parents when they come visit. I usually get the Tandoori chicken or the Roganjosh. Girlfriend usually gets the okra. I always order several servings of garlic naan - one of the best midnight snack foods ever. A+ in all categories.
__label__5	Although I'd never heard of this place before trying it, it's not had to see why Famous George's is famous.  Their pizza is excellent, with crust that's crisp and sauce that's good a sweet taste to it.  They also make excellent cheese steaks.  But I think my favorite thing from them are the calzones.  They are incredibly good.  There's plenty of parking around the place, the staff is friendly, and orders are prompt.   I'd highly recommend Famous George's for anyone who lives in the King of Prussia area.
__label__5	"After having a bad situation with a different plumbing company, I was very skeptical of all plumbing companies. But Wehby Plumbing was both professional and honest. They showed up on time, were very respectful and did a great job. In fact, they offered a few tips on how I could save money too! I highly recommend this company!

Oh, I will also note they only charged me $116 more for 2 toilets than the other plumbing company charged me for ONE. Very reasonably priced!"
__label__5	Just awesome food!!! Service was fabulous Bobby K was our server and was right in with everything. Are tons of oysters, and had the crawfish Macaroni that was out of this world. Get here now!!!
__label__5	Love this bar.. the bartender is the best great atmosphere. I'll definitely be back!!
__label__5	I have only been there once (so far), but had the best fish tacos in my life!  It was packed when we were there which tells me that more than just the fish tacos are awesome.
__label__5	Love this salon and the attention.  Lots of color options.  Massage chairs are awesome and. They have other services.
__label__5	We love Kirsten! She is awesome plus the food we ordered are . We will always come back to this place, everything is perfect.
__label__5	The only Mexican food I can eat without regret. The naked burritos are revolutionary. And you must get their home made chips.
__label__5	I've been going to First Watch for a while now and they're by far my favorite breakfast spot in town! They're fast and efficient and it's always a good meal. It's a perfect start to the morning!
__label__5	Sorry, memory is bad, but I believe the Woodard technician was named Brandon.  Outstanding service.  Woodard has the well-deserved reputation for best carpet cleaning in STL.
__label__5	"Okay, so being quite inebriated I can say without a shadow of a doubt.  Chili pepper shrimp at Trenasse is above and beyond.  Best shrimp in NOLA.

Edit: No longer inebriated, still think this the best shrimp I've had in NOLA, and possibly all of Louisiana."
