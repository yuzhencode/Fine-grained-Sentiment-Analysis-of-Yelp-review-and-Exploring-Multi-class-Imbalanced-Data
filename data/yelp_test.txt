__label__2	When we went thru the drive thru my mom asked for a cup holder and they only gave her the cup holder without the drinks and gave us the drinks to put in our self and they were rude when we were ordering.
__label__5	Highly recommended. Definitely a place to come for dinner or lunch or just for a drink after shopping at Cherry Hill Mall
__label__4	The o-toro was to die for, although I've had better uni.  The salmon was good.  I haven't tried the rolls, but the udon was flavorful and delicious.  The prices are a little steep so I wouldn't recommend coming here often (unless your wallet could use some lightening).  However, I will be back if only for the o-toro.  It just melts the moment it is placed in your mouth.  Okay, now this is making me hungry...
__label__5	What an amazing place. Everyone is so knowledgeable and professional. We purchased an aquarium for our home and every step was fully explained on how to set up, test the water, care for the fish and more. If you want anything fish related, this is THE place to go!!!
__label__2	Had there chilli which was just ok, but defiantly not worth 6$. The bowl was mini sized!  Tried a burger today, Was nothing special. The meat was bland with no flavor. Will defiantly not go back for food. Sat at the bar Friday night for a bit, it's a decent place to drink.
__label__5	Best Pancakes Ever! Went to Katie's for brunch last Sunday and ordered the Lemon ricotta pancakes. They were absolutely delicious and the service was great.  We'll definitely be back!
__label__4	Amazing food!! Not that much variety though. But the quality of the food is great! The bacon here is spectacular, it is a must if you come here! Decent service as well
__label__2	The food here is always on point, however, very disappointed about the fact I made a reservation for 6:15 and by 6:30, we still weren't seated.  We had somewhere else to go after, so being on time was crucial.  What made it worse was people were getting seated that came in after us and the size of their party was the same as ours.  Not happy with the lack of turnover and preparedness for people who made reservations
__label__5	Haliey at the Clearwater location is absolutely amazing she is patient and kind! She went above and beyond! Made my day even more special! She helped me find my dream dress!
__label__5	First class operation.  Used this service for transportation to and from the airport.  The vehicle was a Cadillac SUV, very clean.  Included were bottled water, snacks and wi-fi.  Mike was professional and friendly.  We were picked up punctually and got to the airport the time we had requested.  Plan on using this service again and have recommended this service to others.
__label__4	"After working out at the gym my Dad wanted to try this place out. And oh my and I glad he did. 
What You Need To Know:
- Safe location in the city of St. Louis
- Owned by a really cool couple 
- Family friendly (even a child play area)
- nice decor perfect to chill or have a meeting
- the smoothie was INCREDIBLE
- everything was freshly made

I will highly recommend this spot. If you are in the mangrove area stop by."
__label__2	Food quality solid but EXTREMELY slow service.  Took forever just to get someone to take forever and then it took forever and a day for the food to arrive.  Maybe they were short staffed on a Sunday but I was unpleasantly surprised that an airport dining establishment could be this slow.
__label__2	Filet Mignon was super dry and flavorless and came out room temp. Potatoes were also flavorless. Mac and cheese was sweet, what the what???  Only positive is it's location is in downtown and walking distance to everything.
__label__1	Mannnnnnnn People in Reno are weird I swear. I said hi to the server and he literally said nothing. On top of that he got some dirty ass fingernails. Been sitting in the drive thru for bout 15mins now too. Hopefully bruh ain't makin the food but he probably is. It's McDonalds I mean what can you expect. But the young man who handed me the food was ve
__label__5	We went to Fleming's for our anniversary.  I can't say enough about how special they made us feel.  The table was decorated with confetti, a rose and an anniversary card. We had the Tomahawk special with Fleming's potatoes and sauteed mushrooms and creme brulee and cheesecake for dessert.  The food was delicious.  We were also given flutes of champagne and a box of truffles. The service was spectacular and the staff was wonderful. I highly recommend.
__label__1	Bought a sausage egg and cheese McGriddle from the McDonald's on Ames and westbank expressway in Marrero. I check to see if my order was straight which appeared to be without unwrapping  each individual sandwich until I got home. Low and behold they gave me a McGriddle bun instead of a sausage patty. Yes this was after hurricane Ida and it was a limited menu but there's no excuse for this
__label__1	Rude,  rude, rude......nor sure what the deal is with this place but bad vibes and unhappy people. Go somewhere else and get better service.
__label__5	Cute little spot hidden in the funk zone. I usually get the fish or chicken tacos. They offer a big selections of salsas. It has a small mom and pop store vibe with a cool spin.
__label__2	Acceptable selection of cigars, however they are all large ring gauge and kind of over priced, the bar SUCKS! No mojitos, no wine selection, just a shot and beer type dump.
__label__4	Good, fresh food, but it's a fake whited out version of middle eastern food. Still tasty though, decent falafel as well.
__label__5	Yes, Si, Hai, Da, Sim, Ndiyo. Visit if you have a chance. Great selection of beer and wine in a great atmosphere.
__label__4	"Great location, great atmosphere, really good food.  Try the pizza and the garlic chips.  

The patio is dog friendly, yay!

My only gripe -- the service usually sucks.  It's like they know they are popular enough they can skimp on good service."
__label__4	Peppy Grill is my go-to easy brunch spot.  I love the fact that I don't have to be fancy (or pretend to be fancy) here.  The coffee is good, the wait is short (and normally not a problem), and the food is very good for pretty cheap diner fare.  I love that they'll make me a chocolate chip pancake and that everyone can gather and discuss how they spent their weekend.  My friends and I go to Peppy's and act like a family.  It's wonderful.
__label__5	Cassandra does such a great job grooming our sheepadoodle, Paisley.  It wasn't easy finding a great groomer here in Nashville, and we're so glad to have found her! We've had some bad experiences with other groomers trying to work with Paisley's difficult undercoat, but I never have to worry about our pup coming back knicked or with any mats remaining when she sees Cassandra.  She is very sweet with the dogs too, I know Paisley is in good hands when she's there.  Great experience with Cassandra, all around!
__label__4	Enjoy their Gyoza to start. Their food is always fresh! I usually get their pacific rim rice with shrimp so very good! My husband loves their duck dishes. My daughter loves their red curry. Come for the food not for the atmosphere. Service is usually very good but not so much in our last visit.
__label__4	Great spot to park at the bar and get some good food!  Pretty empty on a Monday night.  Crab cake was pretty good and the service was attentive.
__label__5	The cakes here are amazing!!!!!! My best friend recommended this place to me when we were visiting her in Charlotte so when I saw that one was opening here I was beyond happy. My favorite is the lemon and chocolate cake. My daughter loves the red velvet cake. Try it. You will not be disappointed!
__label__5	Delicious food! This place by far has the best burger in town for fast food. The staff are cheery and keep the place clean. I like the stash of free peanuts that I can shell while waiting for my food. The best thing in the menu is the shakes., but the BLT comes close behind. I don't know of any other restaurant that loads on as much bacon. Mmmm bacon.
__label__2	Been there twice, did not like their service. The food is average. Won't go there again.
__label__4	i've passed this course hundreds of times going to Jeffersonville and finally I told myself I would try Westover. I am very glad i did. Great course. Its not huge but a fun course to play. It was in good shape the couple times i played there and the people I met on the first tee to be my friends for the next 4 hours were always super nice. I will defiantly go back.
__label__3	Not a huge fan.  A little pricey, and I wasn't that impressed with the food.  Drinks were good, service was good, atmosphere was nice, but not worth the price.  4 of us, with 2 apps, 4 entrees, 2 desserts, and 2 drinks each was about $300.  I don't mind paying more, but I just didn't think this was worth it.
__label__4	"I was here for dinner and a Brazilian band was playing (very good).  Waiter was so nice, food was very good, some entrees better than others. Thought it was wierd that the owner/chef and waiters were mixing drinks behind the ""bar"" for themselves while waiting on customers."
__label__5	This is such a beautiful little shop with the best selection of Limoges I've ever seen. The owner is so sweet- she's even too sweet to tell people with children not to let them touch. While I was in there a family with two small boys came in, they started picking up everything and I could tell she was bothered. She made an attempt to gently ask them to stop which was ignored. Please do her a favor and keep a close eye if you bring children into this shop.
__label__3	Pretty good selection of sushi, but a little overpriced. But this place has Groupons every once in a while, which is usually the only time I go.
__label__1	Disappointed and feeling like we were completely taken advantage of by so called specialists!  My puppy has terrible allergies and is scratching herself raw, but we are told she is too young to have allergies!  I call b.s.  They charged us a ridiculous amount of money and prescribed her the exact same meds as our regular vet!  I think they are all just about the $$ and pulling on your heartstrings cuz our pets can't talk. It's crazy bull!  I would never recommend going here!
__label__5	Great bourbon selection, a lot of awesome local beers to choose from, and bartenders who seriously know their stuff. The Tuesday special- any 4 Hands beer, a shot of bourbon, & burger for $10 - is definitely worth checking out!
__label__1	I ordered my food and was sitting in a booth facing the kitchen. I was disturbed to see an employee pick up my sandwich and put it into the oven WITH NO GLOVES ON. I work in food service as well, so this was a giant turn off for me. I will never be eating at this restaurant again despite the delicious onion rings.
__label__3	The food was wonderful, would give it 5 stars, but the service annoyed and ruined the dining experience. Our waitress was borderline rude, there were 5 in our party, all having $30+ menu selections and drinks. She acted like she was tolerating us. I ordered a second glass of wine, same as previous and had a distinct different taste, woody in fact. She was annoyed that I argued that it was different and refused to exchange it, pathetic. Her tip went from 20 to 10%.
__label__2	This place is ridiculously pretentious for a microbrewery. We often visit during a charity pub crawl and they are always annoyed with us, even though we order food and tip well. The acoustics are awful and it's like being in a gymnasium. Food is decent, but overpriced. Work on your customer service, please. There's so much potential.
__label__2	Unfortunately, #78. Beef Chow Fan with Bean Sprouts was lacking any flavor and barely had any beef in it. Some other food around looked better. Probably would not go back.
__label__5	"This La Salsa is the cool one.

Don't forget Marble Slab, the best mix-stuff-up-in-ice-cream place, is at most a 50 yard walk away."
__label__5	Craig was recommended to me as a Stucco inspector after I purchased a house. I couldn't have more good things to say about him. In addition to being a stucco repairman for many years before moving to inspections, he knew a lot about many other aspects of home construction and improvement. His report was extremely detailed and he has been very responsive to small questions I've had after the fact. I would highly recommend him.
__label__5	Really, really good food at a great price. Got the sampler for two and blintz for dessert. Don't forget to BYOB! Would have been better with wine. We've eaten at lots of Central European restaurants, this was good within the category. Everyone working there seemed to be related. We got a bag of frozen perogis to take home, too, and they made it a baker's dozen. There was live music, but not too loud at all. Service was very fast and polite.
__label__1	"Consistently a bad experience- coffee is not even warm - at 8:00 am! There is always at least one ingredient omitted in the breakfast sandwich. Today it was the cheese - so disappointing. 
I have always been able to count on Panera for hot coffee and decent food. But not at this location."
__label__4	Enthusiastic assistants that work with your child each week. They have a fun token system for kids, and monthly contests. We now have a beautiful smile!
__label__2	please watch yourself  ! unhelpful hipsters with a uppity attitudes . I wanted to put my one pan on the counter  top and was yelled at by some hipster in cut off jeans .  This is the second time that someone has been rude and that kept me from coming back for a minute but that will be the last time i will enter that store .
__label__5	Absolutely the BEST Thai food in Pinellas county! So excited I found this place. Willbe coming here every week and bringing all my friends  I ordered the spicy chicken Green Curry. Delicious and just the perfect amount of flavor. My friend ordered the Red curry and felt the same. Super clean beautiful atmosphere. A must!
__label__3	2nd time stopping in before work.. I gave them 3 stars because the first time I came I enjoyed my espresso, but today service was poor, my bagel was old, and my cap reflected their poor barista skills.
__label__2	It was OK, they didn't have any turkey on this day so had to substitute chicken but when you want a turkey club it somehow doesn't taste the same. Casual place with salads, Flatbread, sandwiches. It's in strip center so plenty of parking and other choices here. You order like fast food similar to Panera. Bread is tough, just fyi.
__label__5	Authentic Italian hoagies. Great salami and sharp provolone. And they have Coke in glass bottles.
__label__1	We have had the worst experience with this firm. The latest issue is we signed forms to have our medical records transferred and they ignored this for 30 days plus the new dental office called five time and I called three times without any call backs. I had to drive there finally and wait and still only got copies of X-rays not complete files.  Then work they did for free on my because of how unhappy she was with her braces. They are now trying to charge because we left. The work was done 6 months ago for free now they want $311. Already reported them
__label__5	Couldn't love this place more than I do! Food is great, margaritas are tasty, and they get you in and out quickly regardless of the wait.
__label__5	Absolutely delicious ramen. Everything about this place is vastly superior to their next door neighbor Bowl, despite its better yelp rating.
__label__5	All three sauces are amazing! Price is good for the amount you get! I tried the whole chicken combo with three sides! The yuca, Peruvian fried rice and sweet potato fries! The quality and quantity is amazing. I also paid for an extra side of plantains. I don't regret it at all. I would def come back again.
__label__5	I manage a business down the road and often take friends to eat here. I've never had a problem with my food, service, or anything else. The owners are friendly and always there to greet you :)
__label__1	I don't know if I've ever left this place without feeling sick later..... Probably never going back....
__label__2	I ordered take out and was not super impressed. I ordered the mushroom and paneer makhani and lamb korma. The lamb was tough and chewy, the sauce was bland. The makhani lacked flavor and was a very small portion. The naan, however, was delicious.
__label__5	Came here for dinner. The pho was pleasantly delicious. I got the shrimp pho. They prices were reasonable, service was pleasant, and food was great. It's in a little bit of a sketchy area at night, but this was was fine to be at.
__label__5	I spent hours here. I'm not a huge garden person but this was just so relaxing. They were enforcing social distancing very well. Masks must be kept on outdoors, just to know. There is plenty to see, plenty of places to sit, and you could be here for hours just exploring. I really enjoyed the Japanese garden and also the indoor climate-controlled tropical rainforest! Definitely worth the money and a good visit. Last time I was there, everything in the gift shop was 40% off.
__label__4	My husband and I are frequent diners at this location. Though the parking lot is often full due to being attached to a mall, they have free valet parking when/if you cannot find a spot. Very easy! We always make a reservation and are always seated almost immediately. The severs are all great, even at peak times. We've always had delicious, satisfying meals. The mozzarella marinara is the best appetizer on the menu!
__label__4	"Yes it's 104 outside, but the noodles and soup are sooooo good. The people are great too.

Great local place to eat."
__label__1	if i could give 0 stars i would. the most disgusting pizza i've ever had in my entire life. if you are dying to eat after a concert dont do it!!!!! it was a huge mistake!!
__label__4	I visited this evening for the first time. Pleased? Yes. I ordered the stew beef, mac and cheese, and cabbage. No complaints. The food is flavorful, delicious, and enough for two days. I will definitely be making a return visit. A customer told me the bbq chicken is delicious. Down side, it's only available on Fridays. Give this place a try.
__label__1	We recently purchased a pellet stove from the store that wasn't working upon installation. We attempted to return it and because we had someone with a truck to pick it up they charged us $79 pick up the defective stove. They would not exchange for a new one for 48 hours until their third-party delivery person confirmed they had it! In the meantime the temperatures are dropping into the mid 30s at night... Went to the store to try to get some resolution and the manager wouldn't even meet with me! This is the downside of a good economy... Poor customer service!
__label__5	"Fast Checkpoint, many restrooms and restaurants.
Clean. Fast baggage check and fast baggage claim.
Very nice."
__label__5	Cheyenne is incredibly down to earth. My session with her was so comfortable and hilarious. Cheyenne makes sexy feel as simple as it is and the way she captures light is amazing. I look at my photos and I'm like wow, that's me!!! Such a sweet, but badass woman! Def recommend it to everyone. Single, coupled, family, whatever
__label__5	"Great people and a great company! It only took a year but we are Nashville homeowners! We can't thank Jessi and Jenn from Southbound Group enough for all of their work and patience with us! We aren't the easiest of clients but they were there for us every step of the way. They have been a fantastic introduction to Nashville and they truly know their business! We would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a home, whether local or transplant!

__label__4	"I bought two cars from this dealership. Out of all the Toyota dealerships I have been to, this one has been the best for service and overall buying (selection of trim options and pricing). 

I would love to give 5 stars but I just bought a brand new 2020 and Monday night my car was DEAD. Really disappointing that I have to drive all the way from 33611 to have them look at it so early. I hope they make this right but I don't think any major corporation or dealership caress about these kinds of things."
__label__3	Pizza was ok, nothing great. Not sure what people are raving about here. Get into some other shops.
__label__5	The staff is very helpful and friendly. Parking is tight. Pricing is what you would expect
__label__3	Updated review: HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED with my last order. Hoping it was just a one-off. We ordered a pizza to go and there was SO much oil in the box and all the toppings and cheese were stuck on the side of the box. Clearly someone dropped the pizza and didn't care to open it to make sure it would be satisfactory to give to a customer. This was my favorite pizza restaurant and I hope I can order from here again and have a better experience.
__label__5	Some of the best Chinese food in Tampa area. The salt and pepper eggplant or really salt and pepper anything is out of this world and a great starter. I had the Honey walnut shrimp and you get nice big juicy whole shrimp and the sauce isn't overwhelming and sweet with a nice crunch of candies walnuts. Can't recommend highly enough
__label__5	"This conveniently located grocery store even has free parking! I'd highly recommend it to anyone who loves healthy food. Their hot bar is amazing and their floral shop is cute. The coffee shop is nice, but always fail to have decaf espresso which upsets me dearly. One thing that I don't go to WF for that I wish they would add is can openers and other basic kitchen essentials. 

I hope that WF continues to do well downtown because I love the convenience factor! 

Pro trip: try their breakfast sandwiches!"
__label__5	Out at Jazz fest with Mercy Endeavors. Beautiful Day. Not as hot as usual very pleasant.
__label__5	"Best FLAN ever!  But let me back it up.  Started date night with a killer mojito from the bar.  Fresh and tasty!
Salsa salad was huge and split between the 2 of us.  Mango dressing - Yes,Yes!
Sweet plantains, yucca,  etc.  Fresh ingredients,  attentive server. Authentic food. Clean and inviting.
Next time, weather permitting, we will enjoy the deck too."
__label__5	I have been coming here for many years - great operation and great people!  I have been to many places across the globe and this operation has the largest area to jet around in and have fun.  For the best fun, go as early in the morning as you can - just like water skiing, when the water is like glass.  Don't forget to bring your cell phone with you and take pictures - great pictures and great screen savers to remember your fun!
__label__5	Their selection is wide and the seafood is so fresh that you'd think it was just caught five minutes ago.  I have never been in a seafood market where you didn't smell fish, and Medford Seafood Market smells of nothing but sparkly cleanliness.  I found this little treasure just driving by one day because I am new to the area and I will never go anywhere else for my seafood.  They have takeout meals as well; fried oysters, fried scallops, she crab soup, manhattan/NE clam chowders.  They do party trays as well.
__label__5	"This place has everything. Prices are lower than others around. Scammers are around in this industry, so you have to be careful. These guys come in a marked truck. Make sure you are dealing with the real West Philadelphia Locksmith Co. - 215-386-2929.

Seems they are always looking for new talent. Know anyone?"
__label__3	A nice new option for Butler. Service is excellent. They're very attentive and prepared. Food is fine, and it's nice you can get breakfast all day. The odd thing, to me anyway, is every portion I've seen there is easily three times what a human should eat. It seriously looks like an entire chicken, etc. It's almost comical. Would like to see them offer smaller portions at lower rates. Cost is a bit high, but I suppose you get three meals if you can save what they give you. Recommended. Worth a look.
__label__1	Sunday brunch was terrible. Everything on the buffet was cold and the meat carving station was  a pile of dried out shoe leather. The only saving grace were the pancakes and omelettes both made to order. Will not be back.
__label__5	Classic food.   Addictive.  Hot. Fast. Great service even during covid.  We have been going to this location for 25 years.
__label__2	Great venue, fun crowd, awful bartender. I'd love to come back and try again. Had an extremely rude bartender, it wasn't personal, she must have been having a bad night as everybody was receiving the same service with attitude.
__label__5	Dr. Levy is very knowledgeable, professional and personable.  If you hurt, or just need a posture readjustment, he can make it right; right away!  Never a wait in his office and I always feel like I'm his only patient.  He takes the time to answer questions and to give suggestions. I'll never go anywhere else!
__label__2	I ordered the goat cheese and apple salad because I don't eat meat, and there is no meat in the description.  The salad arrived covered in chicken.  I don't know if they thought they were throwing in a bonus, but it ruined the whole salad for me, which is kinda the opposite of a bonus.  It also did not come with the promised roll with butter.  I will not be ordering from here again.
__label__1	I been with Verizon for 20 years but recently they have the worst customer service I am thinking to change it
__label__5	Sea salt coffee was really creamy. Good portions on the bento boxes. Octopus balls were sweet and savory. Good service as well
__label__4	"A great place to be. The motto should really be ""come hungry, leave happy"" because it's an amazing experience every single time."
__label__5	We love Children's Learning Adventure! The entire staff is fantastic!! My daughter loves her teachers and her friends and so do I. She's been learning so, much and looks forward to school every day! adventure Fridays are our favorite! I love how they keep you informed of everything going on daily and have fun little events that includes the entire family! Enrolling her into CLA was the best decision ever for giving her a head start on becoming, brilliant.
__label__4	I have been here for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I have never been disappointed. The food, service and atmosphere were great. My wife and I love coming here.
__label__5	I worked with the Mabble team as a consultant for one of their clients (non-wedding). They are very professional and flexible in terms of working out agreements and moving along timelines. I love their mission to change the face of Reno as the city continues to develop. I'm excited to watch them grow as people discover the high level of talent here. They're small, but definitely pack a punch.
__label__5	I work way too much and decided to order a week's worth of food so it would be there when my Zoom day ended. I expected it to be convenient, I didn't realize it would be so delicious! So.delicious. The sweet potato lasagna was my favorite, but a close second were the crab cakes and banana cream pie. The roasted beets and farro salad were also great. Delivery was Covid safe and easy, wonderful portion size, I love supporting a neighborhood business and this is my new way to stay fed. Thanks, Nate!
__label__5	"Five stars simply because this place brings me great joy. Living across the street, I have to resist the urge to buy a juice everyday. 

Service is always friendly. Not the most professional environment, everyone is always dressed very casually and seem to be socializing with each other or other friends more than working. HOWEVER. Still five stars because they're super nice and the casual feel fits the vibe. 

I recommend the Bon-Bon Acai bowl. And the grapefruit juice. 

But be prepared to pay when you go here. It's not cheap, but it's a refreshing treat!"
__label__5	The House of Hearing is simply delightful! The staff is overly accomodating and professional.  They are not money hungry and are excited to give the gift of hearing to others.  Very caring.
__label__5	Great all around. No complaints. Thorough, answered my questions and gave a detailed report. I would highly recommend.
__label__3	The ambience is invitng and fun. Service was friendly. Now to the food, it was ok. Would I return, yes maybe with a group of friends. They are lacking with protein options. I must say the cauliflower and brussel sprout tapas were very good. Yet the crispy duck was disappointing. The duck was not crispy and served on a sauce that was not very good. Portion size was perfect for sharing.
__label__4	Why all the hate. Dominos makes it easy to order on the internet and it tells you when its ready. They have always gotten my order correct. Now lets talk about the pizza itself. It has come a long way of being cheese and sauce on a cardboard crust. I actually enjoy it. Is it my favorite pizza......NO.... but it is conveent and inexpensive.
__label__4	I found reYou on Groupon after having upper back and neck pain for a few years. Michael reached out ahead of time and told me exactly what to expect. I travel almost every week for work and usually get deep tissue massages every few months. This type of massage at reYou was unique but still very effective. I left feeling much more relaxed and was without pain in my upper back for a few weeks after my appointment.
__label__5	"No better way to take yourself out than a hand grenade. 

These tasty little treats will kick your keister!  They're well priced for their potency. I tell everyone that is going to NOLA that they need to have one, that includes you!"
__label__1	All around this place is a not worth the money and the WAIT.  The lb. of shrimp was extremely bland.  Never got to try anything else because it never came.  The management is equally as bad.  There was no acknowledge of the poor service provided.   Normally I would give a place a second try being that this can just be a one time fluke.  However, I'm not impressed with the food so much so that it's really not worth the time.
__label__4	Reminded me of a chicken place in Dallas TX! Staff was friendly. Chicken was crispy and had good flavor! Biscuits are so delicious sweet and soft like I like them! Frozen drinks are just ok not  enough liquor taste more like 7 eleven slushy to me. Other than that food is good a little expensive but good flavor! Would recommend!
__label__4	Cool place - about 7 page menu of different beers and decent happy hour menu of appetizers. Good service. Few TVs for sports games. REALLY nice outdoor seating area for drinks and people watching across from Curtis Hixon park
__label__1	Wow, just stopped in for a beer or two while catching up on email and met with major bartender attitude.  She  has no business being in the hospitality business, as I sit noticing, she's not the only one.  If you're in that bad of mood should probably stay home.
__label__5	First of all, Carmen has amazing customer service and is great to do business with.  Used her catering service for my office Christmas party.  Our guests were delighted with the chicken stew, pork shoulder, rice and beans and empanadas.  Awesome food!
__label__5	Love this place. I come in from KC to get my hair done here! Rachel is the best for relaxers :)
__label__1	Once again food is great service is horrible, much better service if you sit at an actual table. Food will not disappoint but actual service horrible!!!! Do they even have an o
__label__5	Dr. Berg is fantastic! I've referred many coworkers here as well as friends and it's all the same result; hes great! His support staff is awesome as well, they knew me by name and were all very friendly. I'll be a patient for life!
__label__1	Not surprising the place closed. Ever since the new ownership, the place just spirals down in service and food quality.
__label__1	"I'm reiterating what the previous comments but the names are different Rick Roma salesmen who received his commission on my 1700 warranty purchase 
Cowardly will not respond and Hector in financing who promised to send check but it's been over 2 months now and no check 
Does anyone know who owns this crappie company 
I'm going to physically go to this location and get my money if all fails 
News flash it will go viral!!!!!!!"
__label__5	I gotta say, I liked these ribs better than Pappy's. The ribs here were more meaty and came with a delicious sauce already lightly brushed on them. The homemade potato chips and fire and ice pickles sealed the lunch deal. I'll definitely be back to Bogarts before I hit up their competitor. The place is small and homey, so be ready to wait in line or not guaranteed a table when they are busy. We found seats at lunch with no problem.
__label__5	I had a big elaborate write up ready for this place, but let's be honest, you don't wanna read a bunch of crap. We came in from out of town and asked our hotel to recommend the best bbq in town. It was a unanimous decision to come here. And I don't regret it one bit. The ribs are incredible, and if you don't get the Mac n Cheese as a side, you're dumb. Go. Eat. Love it. You're welcome.
__label__4	Been going here for almost 3 years. We love Dr Hayes. The office is always very clean and staff is very nice. Sometimes a long wait but almost any Dr we ever see is.
__label__4	While it doesn't always get the love, we find it a consistent place for a casual seafood meal.  If ambience is your driving concern, this may not be the place for you.  With two of us, we almost always can be seated at the bar immediately, and usually just eat there.  (The rest of the place is family-type seating at tables, and looks pretty noisy over there. They also have an outdoor seating area).  The crab cakes (grilled) are very good.
__label__5	"I have ordered from this place a few times. They have always been super nice and pretty fast. Even tonight in an ice storm, they took less time then what the app states.

The pizza is great. The sauce is sweet, just need to state that incase you're not a fan, I would recommend trying it.


I got the sausage Stromboli tonight and I have to say it is one of the best strombolis I have ever tried."
__label__4	"Goat cheese and spinach salad is tasty. 
The gluten free hamburger bun had good texture. I ordered online and it was ready upon arrival."
__label__4	"Been here for happy hour a few times and it's great spot for that, but it gets busy. I also came here once for a ""group painting event"" and that was fun (great location for it). Large interior seating and bar area, smaller outdoor seating area, ample parking, good selection of beers, the ladies tending bar are warm and friendly. Happy hour bar food and drink specials are decent. I've had and enjoyed the Nashville hot wings and one of the burgers (forget which)."
__label__5	Food was very good. Service was excellent! Would recommend this place to all. My husband had the Club and I had the Chicken Sandwich. We parked across the street and walked around the area after lunch.
__label__3	"The warehouse is clean and you really can't beat those gas prices. But what's with the attitude of the sample distributors? On three separate occasions, I've watched and or experienced them being rude or snappy with people; and serving hot drinks in wax covered cups? I don't like drinking wax and I wouldn't let kids either.

Ultimately, this is a great place to shop. But customer service is a big part of that and unfortunately, that's where this Costco fails. Samples are the best part of the Costco experience and you're ruining that for patrons."
__label__4	Went w/ friends for lunch brunch and was pleasantly surprised since my last visit; they expanded the choices, but alas, no Dal.  Good tasting food.
__label__4	Great ambience! Our server was amazing, outgoing and energetic. Extensive drink menu and good food choices.
__label__5	It's a brilliant menu. We have never been disappointed here. Try the chicken wings. I always go for one of the bowls. The pork belly bowl is just wonderful. One of our hands down favorite places to eat in town.
__label__5	"This place was genuinely an experience. I can't necessarily say I'm on the Absinthe train, but going here was fun. Our bartender really explained everything so we didn't feel like we just had no clue what was going on. 
It's such a cool vibe. The chocolate pairings definitely help especially because the taste is a little on what I guess is the bitter side. They offer other cocktails as well so you can always defer to one of those but I would always recommend anyone going to try the little absinthe trio that you can make. 
Check it out !"
__label__5	"Some of the better Chinese takeout in town. Their food is not super greasy like some places. It's an open kitchen and the place looks super clean. Still mom and pop with a slight modern twist. The twists in all the good places. Good customer service and I love that they don't use the cheapest option for takeout boxes. It makes a difference when u bring your food home. 

Only thing I didn't think was good was the hot and sour soup."
__label__2	"It's OK; wouldn't come back. Especially with many better Philly options.

Positives:
- BYOB
- Diverse, large menu (if not overwhelming)
- Fish was average quality, matches price.

Negatives:
- Confused waiter staff.
- Serve spilled a beer; no discount.
- Hard-to-find right off the highway
- Dessert was OK (ice cream), but scooper definitely not washed between different flavor scoops."
__label__4	"Always a great team here...ability to make appts online is a plus.  Ever professional and always willing to explain and answer any questions.  Large store interior keeps you from feeling cramped....and when you're done you can hit Hooters at the mall.  See Crystal at the bar....See what I did there?  A double Yelp.

YELP!!!!"
__label__5	We had a fabulous evening here!  I can see why it gets such high ratings.  Wonderful service and really enjoyed the food.  Highly recommend!
__label__3	I used to really enjoy yard house, but it's just become another boring chain. They all look and feel the same inside. I'd sooner find a more independent, local tap house. Beer selection is great, but the food is pretty average.
__label__4	"My favorite place for wings in Philly. You can smell the sauce as soon as you walk in the door. I rarely order anything else here except sometimes the Spanish fries.  I always recommend this place to people visiting Philly looking for a cheap meal and have never heard bad things from them. 

I often just get the wings to go ...I think they charge an extra 50 cents to do so, which is nothing."
__label__1	Gross, this restaurant  got Dirty Dining for 100s of food safety violations in a month! Beware! I won't be coming back EVER!
__label__1	don't shop here if you support trans ppl. the men in the shop openly pointed and laughed at me and took pictures while i sat at a table across the street. they went inside and got another guy from the back and pointed at me again and laughed
__label__5	This place was absolutely wonderful and I'd love to go back next time I'm in town!   I had the braised ribs.  YUM!  Interior very nice and staff very good also.
__label__5	Colin in parts & Anthony in service were a pleasure to deal with . I needed a washer fluid head replaced w/o an appointment . They took care of me right away ! I would recommend this dealership for your vehicle needs !
__label__5	"Small little place but it is AMAZING! If you see a line, wait cause it worth it! They put toast on the table when you first sit down. New favorite for sure!!

Handcut fries 
Unlimited toast 
ALOT of food for a good price!"
__label__1	"Have had REPEATEDLY ongoing issues with emails
from this business after a very bad experience. I have REPEATEDLY unsubscribed but have always been added back in. I understand this is a Lower Providence small business owner but, at some point, the blame on the corporate structure needs to end and personal responsibility needs to occur. I regret changing my original rating due to the business owner's pressure."
__label__5	We enjoyed a delicious lunch. Pork dumplings, chicken hot pot and shrimp and broccoli lunch special. Service was good too.
__label__4	We ordered delivery right around heavy dining hours and I was surprised how fast our food arrived to our hotel! The food was overall good, but didn't blow my socks away. The pizza we ordered seemed to be a shade over cooked. However, it was good enough we would consider eating here again to give their dine in experience a try! Chicken Mac Pepperoni Pizza
__label__4	Great bread and scones.  If your out for a walk in McKinnon Ravine it is worth a short detour
__label__5	If you like tortas (Mexican sandwiches) this place is for you. As much as I want to try other kinds, I keep getting the al pastor (pork & pineapple). It's packed full of flavor and VERY filling. It is served with French fries - all for $7.56. A steal. I love El Costeno!
__label__2	I am so sorry to be the one to tell everyone that Broussard's is dead .the service is terrible the servers are not trained well -the food is absolutely horrible .the ambience is the only thing that still is there .we were really looking forward to going to Broussard's -the last time I had been there was the early 90s but it's no longer a grand place -goodbye Brousards ,I have all the good memories of you but no more.
__label__3	"Theater was clean but a bit cold. The $6 Tuesday discount has increased to $7.

Bring $$$$ if you plan to go to the concession stand. More than $9 for coke and M&Ms."
__label__3	The food is excellent.  However, if you arrive 15-25 minutes after they open, you will be waiting for items on the buffet.  Naan seems to take forever to come out.  The past 5 visits, I went almost the entire meal without any naan.  If you open at 11:30, please ensure the buffet is filled and ready to go.
__label__5	Fantastic food, with great pride in what they cook! Brian the owner knows his stuff and take any recommendations that he gives you because it will not let you down!!!
__label__4	Best value buffet and been doin it for almost 40 years, love the chicken soup and chili, baked goods great and super fresh salads, for 10 to 12 bucks I don't know how they do it, seniors get ten percent off!
__label__5	"Just tried this place. The Indian chicken cheesesteak is a revelation. I've never had something so familiar and different at the same time. I can't recommend it more highly. 

The other pieces of my order were solid pizzeria fare. So this is a fine choice if you're looking for pizzas, steaks, fries, etc."
__label__5	I loved this place so much I went back the next weekend.  They have such high quality food and such a wide variety of options that it's nearly impossible to get the same thing two times in a row unless that's what you're into.  The people are so nice and I couldn't be happier.  I plan on going back next weekend as well.
__label__5	Highly recommend going through this training program! Aaron is extremely knowledgeable and very communicative. I had lots of questions before and after finishing the training program and he was always happy to help. Thank you!
__label__2	"Came in here on two occassions. Once in the drive-thru and once as a walk-in. The drive-thru was painfully long. Today, I went in and nobody acknowledged me at the door for a few minutes so I tried sitting at the counter. 5 minutes went by and nobody said a word to me so I walked out and went to Qdoba.

The shakes are good, the burgers are okay but you can get decent burgers anywhere. I dont plan on returning unless I have an hour set aside for lunch"
__label__1	The only place where you leave looking worse than you entered. Wish I could give 0 stars.
__label__5	"Everyone seems to talk poorly about this location, but I have yet to get a bad experience. It should be noted I never get delivery, only carry out. 
I call an order in and pick it up in the estimated time they say. Never a hiccup."
__label__5	I loved Addiction both in the old location and in the new. Amazing coffee (the Miss Tracy's is heaven), friendly staff and a great vibe. I come back every time I am in town.
__label__5	Thanks to yelp for highly recommending Harp & Crown. Awesome place and the prices are reasonable. Harp & Crown has an incredible Fried Chicken Sandwich, give it a try I think you would like it, I certainly love it. Workers are incredibly lovely and service is very fast. Good stuff.
__label__5	"Early New Year's Eve.  Great venue for casual dinner and drinks.   Ate at the bar with front row view to the bowl games.  Dave, GM, and Kayla were awesome.  Shrimp a go-go app was super tasty.   patty melt and garlic fries were excellent. 
40 plus draft beer options tonight.  Courtyard/ patio area very cool.  Even short-staffed, service was great and friendly."
__label__4	"We've been several times and always enjoy ourselves. The food is good quality, prices aren't bad, and the staff has always been friendly. They'll meet you with chips and salsa before you even have a chance to sit down.

I've had fish that tasted fresh, burritos that were legit, and a torta that was absolutely delicious. Friends and family have had enchiladas, soup, tacos, and more. I have yet to hear of a complaint. 

Good stuff."
__label__5	I stayed at Philly for 3 days and planed to have ramen at different restaurants every night. The 2nd night, we had really nice ramen here, and still wanted more, so we're back the 3rd night. We just can't get enough. The food and service are both great. We will definitely come back again if we visit Philly again.
__label__5	"""John with a J"" or perhaps ""Jon with a J""... you made my day! Super knowledgeable, HELPFUL and patient. I always have a good experience here but some of you guys make it GREAT thank you! Check out the awesome selections, and the rewards points are such a cool added bonus for freebies and discounts."
__label__5	New restaurant in Webster, it is like going home for Sunday diner with your Italian family! Great menu, open kitchen and a warm and friendly staff. The space is that of a urban neighborhood  in New York or Chicago, a taste of Americana by a young restaurateur's first dip in the deep end.
__label__4	Delicious gelato, friendly service, great location. What more can ya ask for? Try the Nutella. Seems cliche, but hey, its good so who cares?
__label__5	Have purchased several AGM batteries here, and they worked fine... have also used them for their lifetime watch battery service 3 times now and all went well!
__label__1	Awful. Would NOT recommend. We placed our order for pickup at 7:30pm. Not only did my husband have to wait over an hour longer to get our pizzas, when he brought them back to the hotel they were the wrong order. We ordered a thin crust pepperoni and all meat deep dish. We got a thin crust cheese and thin crust pineapple and jalepeno. On top of it they were burnt! We also left a tip online. Find another pizza place and don't waste your money here.
__label__5	We had a great dinner. Good food and nice atmosphere. Mark took care of us there. He did a great job!
__label__5	I really liked this place. Excellent food with friendly service! Everything was fresh and tasty.
__label__5	I've been to these guys about five or six times; admittedly for mostly minor work.  They are very honest, accommodating, and efficient.  The prices are very reasonable.  They matched Tire Racks prices for new tires. They fixed a flat on my wife's car for free.  They have a decent waiting room with the TV and free coffee.You can also go shopping and Produce Junction which is right next door.
__label__1	"If I could give them zero stars I most certainly would. This company is a nightmare. Their customer service is non existent. Calling them is a waste of your time. I cannot wait till I can move far enough away from their ""services"" that they ""provide."""
__label__4	Had received a pain prescription from St. Mary's.  The near by Walgreens had none of the medications so we traveled to this store at 11:30pm.  There weren't many people waiting so we got out in a half an hour.  Pharmacists were cheerful enough for that time of night.  Glad they were open or I'd have to go back to the Emergency room and get admitted to the hospital.
__label__5	"5 stars for New Hope family Italian pizza joint. 

The service is friendly and fast with attention to children. 

The pizza is some of the best around. There crust is soft and chewy inside with a crisp crunch outside. Reminiscent of NYC but a lot friendlier.  

The mild wings are big and juicy perfect for the kids with a little more heat than they are used to eating. 

I can't wait to go back and try their pasta dishes. The toppings are plentiful with some great options like Grandma style.  

My family and I plan to be regulars. The price of beers aren't bad either."
__label__5	Customer service is excellent. There was a little bit of a mix up with our takeout order and they were more than willing to do whatever needed to correct the issue.
__label__3	"Came here for a little weekend getaway. I thought it was a really small but nicely kept hotel. Our room was really small, but homey. Pretty much the bed took up a good chunk of the room. 

The location was nice, it's a bit further from state street and all the restaurants. but its right across the street from the beach, and it's nice and secluded. Especially if you just like those strolls along the beach. 

The only thing is, I think it's a bit expensive for the teeny tiny room."
__label__5	Not many chefs can make a turkey neck this tasty! I want to go back to New Orleans just to try that neck again, well not just for that, but if I go back I will certainly revisit Meril. Great service, Sanya was very friendly and helpful when I asked her about different items on the menu. Their lasagna was also amazing. True 5 stats!
__label__5	"First time here very cozy that has Simple food with Great ingredients, I feel we got our money's worth. Jeremy had the shrimp and blue crab salad ""best salad I've had outside of making it myself since I started eating right""
I had the bbq chicken sandwich with caramelized onions on jalapeno cheddar bread that came with a cup of pork enchalada soup and the blue cheese and carberry salad with cookie. Visually appealing  and just as flavorful thank you for the amazing experience. We will be back. I have to try more of the choices you have."
__label__5	We are always on the hunt of really good food,  we just found a place we will come back to again, and again.  The service is wonderful, and to start the salsa doesn't taste or look like everyone elses.  Our food came out and sorry no pictures because it was that good.  I had a tamale and it was fluffy and full of flavor.
__label__4	Stopped for lunch before a flight. Waitress was very nice and pleasant which is nice for a crazy travel day. Enjoyed a St Pete Beach Blonde Ale. My 3 year old got the Mac. Love the cute guitar plate they put it on. Made it fun for her. I got the Texan. Yum!! The flavors on this sandwich were great. I have to note the little side of beans that came with the sandwich were so good!!!!! We ate at about 11:30 on a Friday just after 12 restaurant started filling up quickly.
__label__1	"Worst wings fried to burn . Cold internal temperature . ordered wing sampler all 5 sauces watery and horrible. They need some lessons on wings frying from their neighbors BW3 . Or remove wings from their 
Menu ."
__label__5	The long-awaited grand opening is finally here and it's beautiful. The Garage is basically a modern food court that has a variety of both restaurants and shopping. There are common areas for seating, and even some corn hole and ping pong! Some of the areas are still awaiting tenants, but we know to expect a coffee supplier and a few more restaurants in the next few months! Parking is available in the lot or along the curb, both with a fee.
__label__5	I have a one scoop smores waffle cone. It was very good customer service was great the employee was very helpful and knowledgeable.
__label__1	Horrible customer service. They put my appointment on my Google calendar for the wrong day. When I brought it up they offered no refund, exchange, or even an apology. Escape from St. Louis on Manchester is substantially better. Nicer building. Better customer service. More fun missions that change periodically.
__label__1	Staff can't tell their behinds from holes in the ground and will outright lie to get customers off the phone rather than provide actual assistance.
__label__5	I've been going to this Boost mobile store for years. I just got 3 new business lines along with my 2 personal lines. The gentleman that works there is always so friendly and knowledgeable he always is able to answer any questions I might have. He always has a smile. Bonus this store is extremely clean and they have even better prices than online.
__label__1	There are other places that are much better. They won't vacuum of wipe down the dashboard because of covid.
__label__4	My omelet with veggies was delish.  Spinach tasted SO fresh.  Bacon also has very good flavor!  Enjoyed it!
__label__5	"Tasty mexican close to downtown WC.
The tacos were delicious, service was friendly and the place us clean. This is a good choice if your in the area."
__label__4	"Great come back for the facility manager. It is getting better. The communication is getting better for the sport team. They have more ideal to communicate to each weekly sport team. At least the badminton. Now with have the text message if the gym is use or rental for other entities. Our sport team players get notice in time. Especially the last minutes notice help not to drive a long distance to play. 

Assignment for responsibility of the front desk also alert. Once the notice was given for the problem area, the items were taking care."
__label__4	The sandwhiches, Italian and chicken, were amazing.  The bread was lightly crispy out and warm and soft inside.  The service was average and they charged us 11.99 versus 8.99 like the sign said.  The salad was also fresh and crisp.
__label__1	Dierks, dude, your food is horrible. Your service is horrible. The location is the only thing you have going for you.
__label__1	This is the WORST management company. They do NOT do anything!! This is the 2nd year in a row that our pond has trash all over it and they just keep closing work orders without doing ANYTHING!! It hurts the value of our homes.
__label__5	"We had such an incredible experience at this restaurant. The staff were all very friendly and the lady who seemed to be the manager appeared to really care about her customers and employees. 

We will 100% be back to this location as this was just an all around great experience!"
__label__1	The worst meal I've had in as long as I can remember. Saturday night and the place was all but empty for good reason. Even if you are staying at the hotel next door I would definitely drive to another restaurant.
__label__3	I give it three stars for the actual food. Nothing special or unique to their menu. However, their roof top bar is what keeps me coming back. Big comfy couches to lounge on while watching breathtaking sunsets. Bartenders and friendly and the drinks don't disappoint.
__label__1	Mislead information with telling their customers about expired rebate codes for their products. Upsetting that their staff had to lie about their products to make it seem more affordable. I will be seeking a different veterinarian clinic.
__label__4	This was our lunch stop on our honky tonk walking tour. The music was pretty good, the bartender was attentive but the food. Yes! Get the rib wraps, probably the neatest (as in less messy) way to get your meat, smoke, sauce and coleslaw. Paired with turnip greens - so flavorful my mouth is watering right now! - you have the makings of a memorable meal experience. The place is bigger than it looks on the outside, so don't let the crowds deter you; c'mon in!
__label__5	"I've been coming here since they opened, best place to get your nails done in the whole city.


Just left here again. My nails are literally PERFECT, every time.


Ask for Tao, she's been doing my nails for years, she is awesome! 

Also thank you Tuan and Michelle, you guys  make this salon truly awesome : )"
__label__5	Great service! Took 15 minutes to replace my iPhone 6 screen! And everything works perfectly! Thank you Jake.
__label__4	very cool decor, great menu... creative and fresh yet hearty no foo foo bs, just solid drink and eats.  The service is dope too.  I went there with the dog and the server brought out a bowl of water for him no questions asked... I thought that was just straight class.  My kinda spot. -the best burger I've had in philly by far!
__label__5	I love this place. just an amazing old school pastry/gelato shop with an incredible selection of sweets. the pear sorbet when in season is worth the trip uptown alone. yummy!
__label__2	Everyone was nice, but that doesn't help if you don't know your product. Cannabis oil is not hemp oil.  Hemp oil does not work...google it and see for yourself.
__label__4	A hands on seafood experience! You can choose many seafood options with different seasonings and spice levels! Many visits have been an overall good experience! Some slow ones but to be understood on busy nights!
__label__4	Cool place. Fresh and lite options on the menu as well as burgers, ect. Small intimate environment.
__label__2	"A lot of build-up for not a lot of reward in the end. The sangria tasted odd. The carne asada was bland and chewy, and the menu was confusing. I love Mexican food and I think they should rethink their recipes. The ""head"" tacos were tasty, but it should be. That is one of the best parts of a cow to eat. Maybe I am being harsh but for all the hype I expected much more. Swanky looking place though."
__label__5	The best sandwiches around the mainline. Friendly staff that go above and beyond to make sure you are taken care of. Happy to call this my go to spot for a hoagie!
__label__2	Great burgers!  But to charge $.50 for MUSTARD is way out of line.  I had to pass 50 cent charge on to the waiter.  Sorry...
__label__1	I tried this place in 2012 and had a meeting with Amy and never heard back. Tried again in 2017, had a meeting and never heard back.
__label__4	Lovely patio away from the tourist action (at least on this particular Saturday). Service was spotty - ours would be gone for 30 minutes at a time. Perfect place for afternoon patio drinks though.
__label__1	Everytime I come to this location they mess up my order and get upset when it's brought to their attention. The team members rush you at the drive thru window before making sure you have everything you need and, once again greets you with an attitude for their mix ups and mistakes...
__label__5	It's an amazing place to eat for a lunch or breakfast after and early start to the day. Wasn't overly crowded or too loud from the close proximity. Seating was very comfortable and the waitress Morgan was lovely as well. The food was lovely as it was recommended
__label__3	"Had high expectaions aftere eating the amuse bouche , a piece of grouper served over a Thai style papaya salad, and the duck confit salad. Unfortunately the entrees did not deliver. My  fish was way overcooked on a bed of undercooked lentils, and my husbands lamb was so salty we could not finish it. 
We ate outside by the pool, and that was very pleasant."
__label__5	Shake Shack always hits the spot. Although it's a little more pricy then say Five Guys the burgers are really good quality meat and their crinkle fries are sooooo good! The cherry blossom shake is AMAZING try it before it's gone!!
__label__1	I went Into chipotle a few days ago and the workers seemed very stressed, the line was very long and they only had two workers working the serving line so they were really slow at making the orders ! Really disorganized, my online pickup order wasn't done in time, way to many people in the restaurant definitely not following Covid social distancing rules. Don't think I'll be back .
__label__5	"DER Laden für Fangear von Tampa Bays Profi Mannschaften.
Egal ob die offiziellen Fan Shops der Teams an den Stadien auf haben oder nicht, auch hier wird man dank der großen Auswahl sehr glücklich.
Die Preise sind gewohnt teuer."
__label__1	"Nothing but a disappointment after eating at the other Emeril's restaurant...I was so excited that they opened NOLA near Bourbon Street. The food was just okay. And maybe the food would have tasted better if the service had not been so poor. Don't waste your time or money at a restaurant that could care less about its customer service. 
Even after I went in personally spoke to the manager it seemed not to matter too much.  Fortunately we went to sucre after and the world  seemed okay."
__label__3	Stayed at a local motel for a few days and made a few trips into The Harp. Almost got my punch card completed for a free beer. Good selection of beers on tap and Daniel was a good, friendly bartender. Fun to find something like Smithwick's on tap. Good local selection as well. The food was good for bar food but about par for a restaurant. A couple of tweaks and attention to detail and the food could be really good. Would definitely go back for the beer and atmosphere and would give the food another try.
__label__5	Antoine's is the pinacle of creole cuisine. If one does not enjoy the food, they must not have had the gumbo, which is thickened to a point very few other places venture  to (Prejean's in lafayette, Commander's, and Arnaud's), or the Oysters Rockefeller, which is possibly the richest oyster dish ever. If he is not a fan of the food, clearly he doesn't appreciate the slightly salty elegance of the souflee potatoes or the rich sauces that have been perfected over the restaurant's long history.
__label__5	I had the pleasure of having Courtney helping me with my phone. I was so impressed with her abilities and most of all her knowledge. She was patient and kind and professional. She was also friendly and helpful. Thank you for employing such young talent, good job. Best customer service. I would highly recommend anyone to this store
__label__3	My friends all love to hate this spot. Their main gripe is the beer list, which admittedly doesn't quite stand up to the Northern Libs and Fishtown competition. But, still, it's not terrible. Service is usually very friendly and prompt, and the place has a nice feel. The curvy bar is cute, and the food has never made me barf. It's in a location that's convenient for meeting friends coming from other parts of the city. I think it has a lot of redeeming qualities.
__label__5	Great service, and the food is delicious. The pumpkin spice pancakes are a must! We moved to the south, but when we come to Philly we cross over to Jersey to get a good meal at this little treasure.
__label__5	The tofu sandwiches are out of this world! I eat here at least once a week. Get the Brussels sprouts with the truffle sauce!
__label__4	"Cleanness: 4/5
Food: 4/5
Service: 4/5

This place is located near University of South Florida. If you are just looking for Venezuelan foods, I recommend you to go here for brunch. The inside looked clean and staff was very friendly. I just ordered Chicken Arepa and Tequenos. The Chicken Arepa looked so fresh and it tasted good enough. Also, Tequenos which are Venezuelan's cheese sticks were great! But the price was a little bit higher, so I uploaded the menu now. Overall, this place is excellent for eating casual foods!"
__label__4	Nice place to take the family to see fish life.. I love the shark tunnel. My only problem is the entrance being so far away from the parking lot..
__label__2	"Not that great - won't go back 
We are two couples that go out to dinner ever week to try different restaurants in the Rend and Sparks area and don't mind spending money for good food - this was not good and extremely over-priced -  the appetizers were ok, salads ok, soup ok, main dish hamburger was ok, halibut bad, mahi mahi bad, fish and chips ok - service not great - if you want to go here for a nice quiet evening out with quality service and gourmet food, this is NOT the place"
__label__4	"We stumbled on this place after a night out and we ordered a couple different things so we can try them out. 
They were all good!

We were surprised that with COVID they were still open inside but we were so glad they were. They make it very easy for you to come in and choose what you would like and be on your way. 

I'm sure we will be coming here more now that we know you can just grab and go."
__label__1	The service is deplorable, waiting 25 minutes in the drive through Is totally ridiculous. On top of that, when I got my smoothie it was not what I ordered. Management needs to do a better job in training the employees at this location. This is the second time I've come to this location and there's been an issue, Making smoothies shouldn't be this hard.
__label__2	I have been to Wasabi a couple of times and just can't jump on the bandwagon.  The food is ok at best.  I had pork Katsu and found it to be plain.....not a lot of flavor.  The same with the tempura veggies that came with.  My friend that I went with mentioned how there is not much on the menu for choices and I agree.  The service was great though......
__label__3	Although the food was for the most part excellent, it was a struggle to get it. First of all it took 30 minutes to get our food and when we finally got it we got the wrong type of wings and they completely forgot my order. The only reason this doesn't have less stars is because they apologized and took the wings and my pizza off the bill.
__label__3	"I often stop in here for middle-of-the-night packs of cold beer or a last minute bottle of vino. The food here is pretty damn tasty for the price. You can't beat it at 5am! Poboys, fried chicken, catfish, and little scrimpys. (that's 5am talk for shrimp) They don't always have all the items on the menu but Yolanda will let you know what's up. 

The only downside is there are people outside 24/7 asking for spare change. So be prepared for that."
__label__5	I'm so glad I went! I'm convinced he's genius. I love my cut. He gave me exactly what i wanted. And my color is exactly what I asked for. It's been a while since I've left a hair salon feeling like my stylist nailed it. And he did. To top it all off, he's a fabulous guy!! I thoroughly enjoyed his company!
__label__5	Joe and his son installed three garage doors on our new construction. They were organized, efficient and friendly. We are very happy with the quality, look and style of our new garage doors.
__label__1	"Place is trash.  Bartender lady upstairs was a B and refused to serve me for no apparent reason other than it was her bar and she didn't have too.  Grabbed a ""manager"" and nothing happened other than him agreeing with her without providing a reason why they wouldn't serve me."
__label__5	Can't wait to go visit again, BUSTER RULES! definitely planning to adopt here when I am more financially stable :-))
__label__5	"I was here in June. The hostess was not trained well and her comments put me off. But I sat anyway. Clay (I think his name was) was amazing...Made this meal great. Ordered the Ribeye, mashed potatoes and shrimp cocktail. Everything was amazing.
When the manager heard the trouble I had when I got there, he offered a free dessert.

I would highly recommend this restaurant.

I am not sure why it has received such bad reviews."
__label__5	We had family in from out of town and did the afternoon delight wine tour, which included 3 wineries and olive oil tasting.  We ask Meredith to customize the tour for a particular style of wine (Italian varietals) and they nailed it!  I was skeptical about the olive oil tasting, but it was a nice break from the wine tasting.  Definitely, worth it and Merf was a wonderful host. Looking forward to our next tour.
__label__2	I ordered the BBQ chicken pizza & mild wings! Neither was the greatest & they arrived about 40 mins after the confirmation said it would! Not sure if I will order from them again
__label__5	I absolutely adore this café! Their Mediterranean breakfast sandwich is hearty, fresh, and amazing. I came here with a friend for lunch who ordered a farmhouse BLT and absolutely loved it. I returned with my husband for breakfast, and he enjoyed their waffle and flavored coffee. This place is cute-quaint inside and the food and staff are wonderful.
__label__4	I would highly recommend this pizza! It was very flavorful and ready to go in a good amount of time to make your flight. My only complaint is that it was way to big for one person and there wasn't a personal pizza option. I ended up throwing half of it away unfortunately!
__label__5	"The BEST Mediterranean food in Florida (I've eaten it everywhere). Ever had a fresh falafel? Makes every other falafel pale by comparison. Shawarma with loads of flavor. And a subtly delicious beef kebab. 

The owner Ami makes you feel at home and is super accommodating. And the prices? Crazy low for the value and quantity you get.

Small place with casual seating and counter service. Great takeout option. However you eat it EAT IT!"
__label__5	So many choices in flavors! Great place to stop and cool off. There is a line out the door sometimes but worth it. They also accept credit cards, which is good for those that forget to carry cash. I tried the key lime pie flavor with the cheesecake in the middle. While it was yummy.. I would probably skip the cheesecake next time. It's personal preference though, as cheesecake is not really my thing. My kids love it.
__label__5	I have been battling thyroid disease.  Joey has been amazing. I have had to cook herbs and chug some strange brew but it is so worth it.  I know I have recharged my failing thyroid. I have definitely lost weight. I sleep better. Plus, he helped my various orthopedic injuries.  I called in to cancel an appointment because of a vile stomach bug I had.  He had me come in anyway and take some herbs home.  I was better in 12 hours. I couldn't believe it.  Usually I would have been down for days. Can't recommend him enough.
__label__4	I usually come here for my morning coffee. I am very picky about my iced coffee, and they make it just right! The service is good and the place is clean. Will continue to come for more coffee!! :)
__label__2	I had an issue with my tostada and the manager came over who was very nice, but told me that this was a new recipe and made excuses. It was on inedible with a spice. That seemed I be dumped not sprinkled.  He should have given us a treat or desert or something to make up for it. I want to like chillis because they have made some great improvements but this was a definite set back. (I was here because my brothers wanted to catch a quick cheep lunch)
__label__5	One of the best GF breads I have had in the valley. Customer service is amazing. Go and try this local company.
__label__5	"Great cocktails. Randy, our waiter every time we go, is so polite and helpful -- and he helps us make the best choices!

Go with the Milkfish grilled in coconut milk. Holy cow, it's like an explosion of happiness. It's terrible that we live right down the street because I want every one of these dishes EVERY DAY.

Try the app platter with the crispy pigs' tails. It sounds weird and gross, but it's PORK CANDY. OM NOM NOM"
__label__5	We re-visited this cute little place after ten years. It was apparently remodeled, even still very small. The home made taco!!! Still the best! We ordered enough taco with different kind of meat, with a lot of salsa:)
__label__4	crap ton of micobrewery beers and a super knowledgable staff that is more than happy to help you find something you like.  hint: you can ask for samples!  their pizza is absurdly large and expensive, but sooo good. if you're looking to save a couple bucks (aka you need more beer $), just flip the menu over and order one of their appetizers.
__label__4	Enjoy the steak very much. They just have to use the there old system with the meat cuz they all come to us at the same time with different meat in the beginning so we feel like we didn't know what we're eating lol. But meat quality it's good. We will go back again.
__label__5	Excellent spot. Local vibe. Very unique and thoughtful drink menu. Also the Waffle of the Day special is cool. Good seating, relaxing.
__label__5	Shakshuka was off scale.  The best I have had.  Planning my next visit
__label__5	It was an awesome experience. They donated this ride for a FundRaiser for Susan G Komen St Louis so they are a great charitable company as well.
__label__5	Wow! Really impressed! Despite the place being a bit crowded, they really took great safety measures. We were nervous at the amount of cars in the parking lot, but they space out the groups nicely. There was glass between each group of people, and the menu was accessible from your phone. Therefore, pretty much everything was contactless. Our cook was amazing and did a great performance. The food was excellent! Best Hibachi around! On top of everything, we were able to easily pay by scanning the QR code on our receipt. Overall, a very pleasant and safe experience.
__label__4	This dominos always delivers pizza in a very timely manner, usually before the quoted time. The pizza is hot and delicious. I especially like their sauce.
__label__2	This place seems to have potential. But on our first visit this weekend, it was less than impressive. Food was okay but not even as good as the kabobs we make at home. The service was poor, maybe because we were lowly Groupon customers, maybe not. They comped the salad that was 15 minutes too late and apologized for the poor service, but it was still a poor experience. Maybe they didn't see us as a good moneymaker but we would have bought more drinks and dessert if we were having a good time. Instead we were just annoyed and bored and wanted to leave.
__label__5	Small, intimate, can be a tad bit noisy BUT delicious.  Only disappointment, no Iced Tea
__label__4	"The root beer and the food is good.  Nice environment.  Good service. No complaints.  I wish I was able to thy a float.  They look good but are huge.  There are 2 levels so plenty of space. 

I will child back when in area."
__label__3	"BLUF:  Free refills on coffee.  Great outdoor seating.  Food looked good but didnt have any.

If you drink your coffee there it is free refills.  That is insane.  It is strong coffee too.  I love outdoor seating and that is all they have.  There might be some covered areas but it is all outside more or less.

Wife got a fancy tea thing that she really liked.  We didnt get food but it looked like a simple healthy place for a snack or breakfast.  

They won my heart with the free refills on regular coffee."
__label__5	We ordered Angelino's for the first time tonight, and it was delicious ! I loved the creamy Cajun chicken pasta and the shrimp and crab pasta. We also ordered the mozzarella sticks, and they were very good. So much flavor and great spices/ seasoning. I'm so glad we discovered this place!
__label__4	I love the food here. Every time we go to Philly we make sure to get brunch. This past Saturday I ordered the short rib and poached egg and it didn't disappoint. The serving was so big I ate it twice (the poached egg wasn't soft the second time, but it was still good)!  We sat outside and truly enjoyed people watching while sipping the delicious coffee. Over all a great experience.
__label__5	Be prepared to wait for a table on any given night but it's worth it. Locations in Nashville and Indy both won't disappoint. No better place for margs and tacos.
__label__4	A little gem on the hill, so authentic I think we were the only non- locals in there! Our food was outstanding. Highly recommend!
__label__5	I would definitely recommend this Firestone. I took a used car I was considering purchasing here for them to look over. The manager Mike was extremely helpful, and took the time to answer all the questions we had about the car even though the store was clearly busy. Terrific experience!
__label__5	Classic coffee stand in City Park. My advice to newbs: don't order your coffee black. Get the cafe au lait. They put chicory in the coffee, and the flavor is strong without milk. Also the hot coffee is hot as hell, so wait ten minutes before drinking or order an ice coffee. Also there's a beautiful stone bridge nearby that you might want to check out.
__label__5	"Came here for my birthday brunch. The place it's self is beautiful. When you look on the outside it doesn't look like much but inside is beautiful and very cozy. The food was phenomenal and the service was top notch! They also had musicians walking around the tables and playing the requests which was super fun way to get the party started. 
Fun fact: mon-Friday they have .25 cent martinis ;)"
__label__5	"Oh My, compared to lunch in Sulpher, WOW!!!
Mulates never disappoints. Wonderful food (grilled redfish, alligator platter, Zydeco salad). Always fun music. Great service from Andrew. Absolutely nothing negative. A dont miss in New Orleans."
__label__4	Love this place! Cheap, nice inside, decent customer service, and DELICIOUS FOOD! Chinese, Japanese, and American buffet so you can bring everyone to eat here!
__label__5	"I give it 5 Stars because it is what it is! Great Italian food, great portions, family owned and operated, they bring ""treats"" to the table like plate of sweet peppers w mozzarella! Prices are so reasonable! Just a great Philadelphia Italian dining experience! RS"
__label__4	"As I told the crowd waiting to get in, Acme is ""worth the wait"".  Superb chargrilled oysters and soft shell crabs. Great service and drafts. And fries. Everything fresh and perfectly prepared. Caveats? Kinda noisy. Raw oysters not iced enough. And that waiting outside. Nevertheless I'll be back."
__label__4	Had the Country Benedict with a side of grits with cheese. Nice combination of biscuits and gravy and a Benedict. Coffee was great and so was the service. Only reason it's not a 5-star, my meal had egg shells and had to be remade. Not a big deal, it happens. Food came back out quick and had part of the meal covered. Will be back!
__label__3	Hard part for me is Panera does not have Gluten Free bread. If they had that I would eat here all the time. I had a salad and it was good. I just wish they made bread i could eat.
__label__5	Loved it. Had the Fern Gully juice and a breakfast burrito for a late lunch. Both were delicious. The waitstaff was very friendly. I'll definitely be back, but I wish it were farther from Wild Cow, so I wouldn't have to decide between them -- not an awful problem to have.
__label__5	So much FUN!!! No one else will have wedding photos like yours! Rev. Tony and Lou Ann were the nicest people. If you are looking for a unique experience, you won't be disappointed. We talked about renewing vows in a year just to do it again. ;-)
__label__5	This is the kind of place where the waitress remembers you and your order, and the food is great and tastes close to your abuela's. I like to sit at the bar because I typically go alone during the lunch hour. There's usually only or two other people during that time. Apparently it gets busier for happy hour, and on weekends they have mariachis sometimes. There's lots of indie and outdoor space. This place is kind of tucked away close to Hollister, off of Pine.
__label__4	We have chickens and a 50 pound bag of layer pellets or crumbles is 30 dollars. That's what we usually get. The treats for the chickens are a little pricey so that's an every once in a while thing. We get scratch though and if you get 10 pounds at a time you get a better deal. Some employees are very helpful and knowledgeable on certain animal questions. Some of the younger employees don't seem to know as much.
__label__5	What a great shopping experience! This newly opened Publix GreenWise is a fabulous urban grocery store with plenty of made-in-Florida options. The staff was friendly and helped me find some new delicacies. The organic options abound and prices are reasonable. Before going to an event at nearby Amalie Arena, I'll plan to swing by the deli for a preconcert or pregame treat. There is a small outdoor dining area that overlooks Water Street. Great for people watching!
__label__4	Excellent choice for dining in New Orleans. The waiter recommended the bowl of crawfish as that was a popular item and they bring you a bib .....be sure to wear it ....it makes a mess. The wedge salad was amazing but the mixed drinks were a little week. Also I'm not sure if the reason was because of groups being there but the noise level was very high .....wecould barely hear each other talk at the table.
__label__4	Dr. Salinisky and Rob have provided excellent care and I cannot say enough good things about them. Just wish I knew more about scar tissue and other potential problems before surgery. The office staff at Brooksville and Hudson are not the friendliest or most helpful...almost rude at times.
__label__1	FRAUDULENT COMPANY! Claimed my credit card wasn't scanning so I provided another, which he claimed was also not working so I paid the standard airport fare in cash. A week later I find out the driver charged me $86 on 1 card and $76 on another card. I will never use anything but lyft or uber anytime I go to NOLA.
__label__1	The old owners of this location had better food and service. Staff rarely wear masks at all, and if they are wearing masks they're around their chin. The Katsu is far more breaded and greasy than the old recipe. The teriyaki has consistently made me queasy, the noodle dishes are greasy. It's convenient, but Yokozuna is far better. Wish they were closer.
__label__5	"Yummy Tacos and Burritos. The right mix of flavors in the salsa. 
Good prices too. Highly recommended if you like Mexican food."
__label__1	Huge waste of money! Go see the one liberty view for a cheaper price and eat somewhere better. The decor, service, and food was not good. Huge huge Easter brunch disappointment!!! The high cost for nothing special.
__label__5	"Ate here last night and had great service, great food, and awesome beer selections! Our waitress, Brooklyn, was right on top of things and was also giving us advice on local places to visit. 
Do yourself a favor and order the Greek fries. They were AMAZING!!! And no one knows how to cook a Beyond Burger like Tarpon Tavern does. Soooo good!"
__label__1	First the wait was ridiculous. They told us 30 minutes and we waited for over an hour and 15 minutes. I get there is sometimes there's an extra wait, but 45 minutes was uncalled for. We definitely wouldn't have stayed if we knew that, but since we waited and its pretty much the only breakfast place in that area we had no other option. Second the food wasn't that great and defiantly not worth the wait!
__label__4	Hey food. Staff is very friendly and polite. Fast service for even a 30 min break. You will not be disappointed.
__label__4	We are Baltimore natives and we come to Coop's Place for lunch first thing when we into town. Usually on a Wednesday. Laura, the bartender who has been there for years knows us by now and I always get the Taste Plate and a Sazerac.  I'm there at least 3 times a year and usually Wednesday afternoon is some local folks and us. Never that crowded that day and time and the Fried Chicken is as good as I've ever had. Check it out!
__label__1	This was probably the worst meal I've had in 15 years of living in New Orleans. Glen David Andrews was playing and of course he is awesome. I brought relatives who had just arrived from California. Not too crowded but took almost an hour and repeated inquiries to get our food. My gumbo cold, all steaks had been requested medium rare and arrived well done yet Cold. Horrible . Waitress and manager were nice and we received a big reduction in bill after I complained but I will never eat there again.
__label__5	The food here is amazing! Very fresh seafood, great atmosphere, and service. We have been here several times and love it. Great prices too.
__label__1	I had to pay for my drink and Black & Blue burger separately, as the cashier would not allow me to order food and a drink at the same time. As a result, I was hit by their credit card minimum, which was extremely irritating. Also, they price drinks like a NYC bar that is struggling to make rent.  $7 for a beer is not appropriate for NOLA.
__label__4	Great place to grab breakfast on the fly. I was in town for work and stopped in to grab a bite before starting a busy day. The veggie breakfast wrap was delectable and very satisfying. Only downside was that the dining area was frigid. Hopefully this isn't always the case. Otherwise, two thumbs up!
__label__1	Last time I went to checkers they were out of French fries. What kind of fast food place runs out of French fries. Every other time I have been there thee service is beyond slow even though their workers are genuinely friendly. Needless to say I haven't been back since the fry incident.
__label__5	We live nearby and were happy to discover this place.  First time we ordered bunch of flat breads which were great and were half off on a Wednesday. Today i ordered salmon for dinner,  my husband had shrimp and lobster and mother In law had parm chicken , all were super delicious. My son had pizza and fries , can't really mess that up! We will surely come back again when friends are visiting.
__label__4	"I'm not in the Audobon area often. We went with a group of 11. They sat us quickly and service was fast and efficient. We were here for breakfast and it was pretty solid. I'm not a fan of cubed potatoes and that's what my skillet was served with. Other than that, it was a nice selection of menus. 

Oh and plus 10 points for the massive bottle of tabisco sauce. 

Minus 3 for the extremely dirty and torn apart menus."
__label__5	For many years I used Dave's Appliance repair but took a chance on Hemi's after reading the reviews on JD. JD was the best service man I ever had. He was honest and non- pressure. I will be using Hemi's (JD) from now on for all my appliance service needs. I suggest you do too!
__label__5	"Amazing. The place was packed, and we thought we were screwed on time.  These folks are gold.  Seriously, on point.  The service was excellent, the menu selection was surprisingly great, and the atmosphere was really vibrant.  Our burger and salad was delicious.
The manager came over to chat with us - we can't wait for the Lafayette location to open!"
__label__5	Top notch service. The Kansas City Strip hereis the best steak I have ever had.
__label__5	Amazing tacos and food all around. Always awesome service and definitely eat here at least once every 1-weeks.
__label__3	This place has great sandwiches BUT they take fooorrreeevvverrrrr to make one. Every time I've ordered I've been the only one in line/no one in front of me and it takes a solid 20 minutes for me to get one sandwich. Even when it's not a toasted one!!!! So that's why I'm giving 3 stars.
__label__5	I'm a sushi connoisseur & they have the freshest salmon. Im getting hungry thinking about how tender and rich their selection is. Definitely a great protein stop after the gym!
__label__1	Love this place but every once in awhile I go I get the guy who is not very nice and doesn't seem to take his time. Recently I went and got a gel French manicure and it looked horrible. First he was in the middle of working on 3 women, including myself. Once he got to me He dug his long fingernails into my fingers, didn't file my nails evenly, seemed to throw my hands around, and rushed. After he was done me he went right to the next customer. I don't think I will be coming back here.
__label__5	"Impeccable service and food. The early bird special is incredible. But the menu is full of treasures. Shrimp cocktail, calamari, waygu steak, prime rib, filet mignon, New York Strip, Salmon and the CHEESECAKE. 

For lunch, please note, do not order the fried chicken sandwich! It is so delicious you may not want to do anything for the rest of the day. 5 stars!"
__label__1	called the service department since there is a recall on my jeep.. takes over 1.5 hours (aka an all day thing) and they don't give courtesy vehicles but have a shuttle driver.. that works for people who work during the day, right? (nope). service department was incredibly rude & let me know they do service saturday's (because everyone works monday-friday?) get it together, and get with the times. won't return for anything at all.
__label__4	Great honky tonk bar! Fun live music. Delicious fried bologna sandwich!
__label__5	"One of the largest collection of French Impressionist paintings in the world. 100's of masterpieces all artfully displayed in a modern, well lit museum. 
I've been several times now and when I return in July, I'll bring others to share in the splendor. 
Always pays to reserve in advance and pick up admission ticket at door. 
Not quite sure how anyone can give this 4 stars 
Literally top 20 museums in the world."
__label__5	Worth the visit to NOLA.  An iconic place with several locations around NO. Food and service were both amazing.  Thank you for the experience!!
__label__2	Cool place, walked in on what was apparently a poker night. Couldn't stand the smoke...walked out. I would have loved this place... in the 1980s.
__label__4	We had family from my Chinese side in town for Thanksgiving, so we brought them to Gee's Garden on Sunday morning for dim sum.  Coming from Los Angeles, my family members didn't have too high hopes of finding great dim sum in Tucson, but we're always looking for Chinese food in any city we visit.  I'm glad to say they said our dim sum brunch exceeded their expectations!
__label__3	Honestly the tacos aren't that great, little to no seasoning on the meat other than on the marinated pork.  But for the price and the speed can't really complain.
__label__5	Omg love love love this place..i took my husband and best friend here last night. We were a party of 6 and Joseph our waiter was amazing and very attentive ..yhe food was simply amazing very flavorful, and reasonably priced...
__label__1	The well recognized name of Coyote Ugly holds a perception of high standards,  unfortunately their standards ended up being quite ugly! For a Saturday night this place was empty and dingy. It was such a disappointment.  Not to mention the blatant discrimination we experienced with the bouncer at the door. Should have listened to my gut after that and not wasted our time and cover charge.
__label__5	I love this place!! It was my first time here with some friends for my bachelorette party. They have hatchet throwing (we didn't get around to that), corn hole and bocce ball. I loved the vibe here. It has a rustic and relaxed feel and it's decorated so nice (for my taste at least). I'm not from the area but I will definitely make the trip back to The Creamery!
__label__4	Husband and I felt adventurous and came here to eat Ethiopian food. The waitress explained the dishes and our delicious and well-spiced food was brought out quickly. This restaurant is very clean and friendly. There were a lot of people here for a Tuesday night.
__label__5	My favorite. Spent $30 on a layover in philly just for a taste! It took someone philly to turn me on to them.
__label__5	"This place served our best bites in New Orleans! We went during Mardi Gras, and service was still tip-top. As a former server, I was impressed with how much the staff helped one another, ensuring prompt, calm service. 

I had a well-balanced dirty martini first- definitely get a drink while you're here. The Caesar salad was the best I've ever had! Crisp, lemony, perfect. I also had shrimp and grits, which I don't even like normally, which were a hit as well."
__label__2	The serving staff seemed disorganized and the food was completely overpriced for the quality. The lamb shank entree I ordered had zero flavor and the pecan pie dessert looked like one of those convenience store pecan pies had been warmed up in a microwave. I guess the wealthy Old Metairie residents keep this place going when they don't feel like driving into New Orleans for better food. Maybe we caught this place during a bad time since it was the holidays but I'm not going to drop another $200 to find out.
__label__5	Loved this place! Stopped in while waiting for our cruise. People were so stinking nice, and food was amazing!!! Skip the coffee cake (in my opinion) and go straight for the breakfast tacos. Incredible!! Boyfriend made his own bowl and it was awesome as well. If I'm ever in the neighborhood, I'll be back.
__label__5	The best chargrilled oysters around!! I love sitting at the oyster bar chatting with the guys that shuck. The Meat Pies are fabulous and the VooDoo Shrimp ooohhh lala! I absolutely love this place!
__label__5	Great coffee and friendly staff. I really like their holiday drinks and their bagel sandwiches. The place has a good amount of seating but it's usually busy. They have outdoor seating too. The decor is really cute. If purple is your fav color, this is the place to go.
__label__4	The new riverwalk is a positive addition to Tampa Bay for sure. Went to mayors mac and cheese fest followed by lit hot air balloon display and it was very beautiful. The festival itself had a few snags. The ticket line required to purchase beer or sample the mac and cheese was insanely long. Then after waiting in that line your wait is equally as long for the beer! Samples of the mac and cheese were small and some lines were to long to even bother with.
__label__4	"This is a classic burger joint. The boys are in the kitchen whippin it up and lookin good while 'doing it. Casual place where you can spend less than $ 20 and get a good ""full all day"" type of meal."
__label__5	A simple hotel with really superior people on staff. We stayed there one night for an early departure the next morning. Debbie at the front desk was professional, informative, accurate and responsive. even the shuttle staff was friendly and remarkably efficient. Wow...the hotel is standard and simple but it does the job. The people working there provide credit to the brand and I wish them all the success in the future...thank you guys!
__label__5	Excellent food - great service - been ordering from here almost from when they opened!  Sometimes we will eat at the restaurant, too.  The food is FRESH, love their soups and they will accommodate with less spice when asked.  Generals Chicken is one of my favs - chicken is tender as is gets.  I slightly know the owner and she is always pleasant to me - they strive to please!  A++++++ and beyond!
__label__5	"I've gone here for the past 15 years and it is consistently great and fresh! The service is spot-on as well and fun to sit in upstairs room for larger parties.  Ming, Dave, Bon, and new guy Kenny are on their game! ""Hello Kitty"" and all her friends love Mustard Greens."
__label__2	I was looking forward to visiting another restaurant on the Monon, but this wasn't worth it. When a menu suggests that a dish has noodles and vegetables, I anticipate more than 3 thin slices of vegetable and an entire plate of noodles. I had to pick around to find a green bean, a sliver of carrot, and one tiny broccoli floweret. It had a nice flavor, but I didn't need to pay $8 for noodles. The soup was very good.
__label__5	Ran into this establishment on a whim to get my dog's nails trimmed.  I was pleasantly surprised to see how welcoming the staff was. The place was squeaky clean inside and out.  I'll bring my girl back here next time. Thanks!
__label__5	I can't rave enough about my experience at this Jiffy Lube. I needed my oil changed desperately. I went first thing on a Sunday morning. The staff was super friendly. The chairs in the waiting room are comfortable and they had plenty of magazines to keep me occupied. I don't feel like they tried to up sell me which was very much appreciated. Thanks to Brendan and the staff for making it a pleasant experience.
__label__5	It was so good, I ordered again the next night.  I travel quite a bit and it was a jewel of a find in King of Prussia PA.  The chicken Low Mien was the best I have ever had.  Nice to have a go to when I'm in the area!
__label__1	Very disappointing. I first bought a necklace this summer and loved it. Good quality & loved the gold. I recently bought 2 necklaces online and and so disappointed in the quality. The gold is low quality and way overpriced. I just went and bought a pair of earrings in store and she gave me a 'new pair' only to find them completely different than the ones on the floor. Am very upset about this bc the jewelry has the potential to be cute but this is unacceptable. It looks completely different than what's being advertised.
__label__5	One of the best choices for seafood in the quarter. Excellent oysters, soft shell crabs. Eat at the oyster bar get to know your bartender. Lots of fun.
__label__4	I order the dark meat... the chicken batter reminds me of Bon Chon. My husband ordered the white meat. He said the breast was juicy. The peas were great. We also order stringbeans... so good. Those are a must try. Season so well. Tiny bit spicy. Bread pudding is WHISKEY forward.... not sure it cooked out but very good.
__label__5	We love Costas's. Their cheesesteaks , burgers and fries are always delicious . Couldn't ask for nicer employees .
__label__5	As a 70 year old person, native of SB, I have been to many chiropractors. Dr. Schroeder is by far the best of the 15 I have used over the years. I am please that he treats my body singularly. He does not treat every person the same as he analyses each person by touch. I appreciate the fact that he does minimal manipulation, so gentle, no crunching, jerking motions.
__label__1	Service was almost nonexistent. 45 minutes and no order we paid for our drinks and left.
__label__5	The food was outstanding.  The menu is very descriptive and they deliver on every claim.  I had flavors I had never had before.  The services was friendly and efficient.
__label__2	The lady leaving seemed pleased which is why I leave the second star. I stayed on the phone waiting for someone to pick up for 14 minutes as I drove to this location. I walk in to see four employees standing around a phone with the line 1 light blinking. As if that wasn't enough, they denied my walk-in stating they were closing earlier than the posted hours on the door. Well I wish I could've known that while holding on the phone for so long.
__label__1	"They are in the middle of switching from coke machines to freestyle. Utter chaos. Why transition on a holiday weekend?

Popcorn everywhere on the floor, stale popcorn, they wanted us to pay for our bottled drinks and full price for a cup of ice. 

Horrible service."
__label__5	Recently booked the patio for a retirement party.  The weather turned out to be windy and chilly... Nadine was very generous in letting us move inside!  The food was excellent and everyone was extremely nice.  I can't wait for our next event to be at Nadines!
__label__1	"Four of us had dinner at the Sockeye Grill this weekend.  Service was terrible.  Super slow.  Salads were warm and tasteless.  Dressing was watered down. 

Salmon was excellent.  Nachos were okay. Finger steaks were mushy and drab. 

Waitress  knew her beer. The dark lager was excellent.  The lighter beers we had were too warm. 

Looks like this restaurant need some fine tuning.  The atmosphere was like a warehouse, more like being in a barn than a restaurant. 

Tvs everywhere but the news was on. Huh? How depressing is that? 

We won't be back."
__label__1	"My visit to this establishment started off normal until the waitress asked to check our IDs and did not return with them. 
Her manager rudely confronted us 8 minutes later stating that two of our IDs were fake and they would not serve us. He refused to even glance at other forms of proof that would verify our LEGITIMATE identities and ages. 

HOW DARE HE? 
I am well over 21 and do not appreciate being told to leave for an inaccurate reason."
__label__5	Devil pasta and Gorgonzola chopped salad!!! So good I forgot to take a picture first!!
__label__5	Awesome service front desk was very welcoming and very nice, I honestly don't wax so this was a very pleasant experience the woman that did my wax was Jennifer Lopez and I highly recommend her, she is so caring and has a great attitude and will go the extra mile to make sure you have an awesome experience so I highly recommend Waxing The City for your next or first visit but make sure you ask for Jennifer Lopez!!! You won't regret it!!!
__label__4	I parents and I went to Verdad tonight for dinner. We have been there a number of times. The strawberry habanero guacamole is a must, and it did not disappoint tonight. The maryland blue crab ceviche was only okay, ditto for the roasted carrot ravioli. The seared tuna was good. The New York Strip was amazing, as was the lobster crab cake. The rabbit was also quite nice. Overall, another great meal at Verdad.
__label__3	I always love a good Ribeye. I will have to say if you want a good ribeye this is not your place. A good sirloin yes. I had went to longhorn and then here a few days later and ordered a ribeye and was so disappointed.  Half of my ribeye was fat. My daughter however had a sirloin that was amazing. This place is also awesome for their rolls and their amazing house salad. But be prepared for a long wait to get in unless you show up right at 4 pm on a a weekday.
__label__5	Wow, I'm shocked to see such negative reviews... I leased a 2016 Mazda 6 iGrand Touring there last night and came away thoroughly satisfied.  My salesman Doug was extremely knowledgeable and helpful, Matt in finance was great and Jordan, the new vehicle manager was great, even offering me one of his personal flavored waters from the employee lunchroom.  The pricing was spot on to what I was quoted on their website, no bait and switch here.  The entire process was quick and pleasant from start to finish... would gladly recommend and return myself for any new vehicle.
__label__4	"After having dinner in the Marigny, I searched Yelp for ""cheap drinks,"" figuring we could do a dive bar tour and get drunk fairly cheaply. The first stop was The John.

Interesting decor, cheap, cheap, cheap drinks (most premium drinks at $6, everything else is even less), and a friendly bartender. If it weren't for the smoke, we might have stayed there all night. However, I eventually needed to go for a walk and breathe.

The John may have worked its way into our regular rotation for baby-free nights of alcohol consumption."
__label__2	Really not that good. At all. My pretzel was old, cold, and tough. The young lady at the counter didn't seem to want to be there. The only good part I guess is that it was $2.35 for a pretzel and bottle of water. Won't be back.
__label__3	Nice place and the food was good. Ordered the crab cake Benedict. Service was a bit slow but not horrible. It would be worth another try.
__label__5	The blintzes plus latke benedict is the sweet/savory breakfast that will put your Sunday in motion. The staff are always helpful and friendly as well.
__label__4	Ate burgers here on Sunday night very good. Service was awesome. Sat at outside table very nice.
__label__1	Another closed dance club
__label__1	Love Chipotle...hate this location.  Most of the staff is friendly and hard working, but there is one chick that needs a serious attitude adjustment...or at least a new job!  You know who you are....crabby ass slacker!
__label__5	Just ate here for my second time. The fried rice is my favorite in the city. The pork is really good. The chicken actually tastes like chicken (not rubbery like most!) and the lo mein is some of the best I've had.
__label__5	Great little place with great small plate creations. Been there several times and always fun and tasty. Met Doug the Manager when he was a Bartender a few years back. Great guy. Ask to see his tattoo! All staff are great. Most Importantly for my crowd the craft cocktails are excellent. Had a few and the 5 appetizers Pre Hamilton last Friday. Everything was delicious.
__label__5	Best coffee in Tampa! Love this place. My husband and I always get a package to take home. The one from Colombia and Brazil are amazing.
__label__4	I got my nails done for the first time here today. I just say may did a great job and we had great conversation. The customer service here is phenomenal. This was the best my nails have ever looked. I would of given 5 starts but it was a bit pricey, however I'm very pleased with the results. Make an appt if u want to come here, they take their time on ur nails and toes and you don't feel rushed and u can get a free glass of wine.
__label__3	Really unique locally crafted root beer and sodas. Known for their root beer floats, very tasty but service was lacking.
__label__5	Enjoyed a wonderfully orchestrated dinner with a small group at this charming BYOB.  Service was perfect -- attentive but not annoying.  The appetizer - shrimp & risotto balls-- just crispy enough.  Spinach Salad good but not a work of genius.  The duck entree, however was fabulous.  Cooked just perfectly and so flavorful.  Thought I would not have room for dessert but when the apple tart was set down in front of me it magically disappeared.  I will be back to try more yummies.  With BYOB it is a reasonable night out.
__label__4	"Fancy and upscale interior with great seafood, located in the CBD.

Luke bacon burger with fries was the best burger on the menu with what it was topped with, in my opinion. Shrimp and grits was delicious, as it was cheesy and creamy to the extreme. As a seafood critic, I am glad to have dined in here.

Chef here is wonderful bringing the elegance out of this restaurant. Decor is beautiful and service is just as spicy."
__label__5	Visiting from Los Angeles and must say the food is really good along with the service. I'll definitely be back.
__label__1	Sat down and the poorly maintained indoor seating caught threading in my new pants and ripped them. I felt around the chair and noticed a lot of rough spots and improperly hammered nails that could easily mess up your clothes.
__label__2	Terrible venue for music. The sound quality is pathetic. This place was definitely not built for acoustics. It really unfortunate Edmonton has so few options for live music venues of this size. Maybe the bowling's ok.
__label__5	Quality juices every time and seriously some of the best salads in town!  I usually stick with the curry chicken.
__label__1	"The Tangerine location in Marana  sucks. Always gets the order wrong. Overcharged my husband this morning and kept the receipt after asking for it at the window to supposedly get the order right but still got it wrong. 
I'm over this place!"
__label__5	"I rate chain restaurants based on the particular location not the whole chain in general..

This is my primary waffle house i visit.. 5 stars my food is always great.. Last few visits i had the same cook which is a rookie.. alittle slow but is doing a damn good job.."
__label__3	Used to be my favorite sushi in Reno!! The people who make the sushi are great, so friendly and make great sushi! On the other hand the service is trash. Hopefully you don't want anything to drink with your meal because you won't get it until you're done!! The main waitresses are rude and look at you like your stupid with anything you say or do.... P.S. Don't get the lemonade
__label__5	Highly recommend this dealership, Great group of people who took very great care of us and best deals in Northern California.
__label__5	Bought my first Harley here and had an awesome easy experience.  Kurtis helped me get set up with a Low Rider S and I couldn't be happier!
__label__5	I want to try everything on the freakin' menu! The beer was insane! So good. Went on a Saturday night for the first time with some friends and it was pretty packed but not too loud. Sat right next to the bar but it wasn't too bad and people weren't in our space. The bread pudding was delicious! Fiancés new favorite.
__label__1	Extremely rude staff. Went in to look for a table for our large group and was promptly shouted at to leave the area.
__label__5	Wow! Great selection of wools, yarns and supplies for other fiber art projects. Just took the 3D needle felting class with Sandy and had a wonderful time. Created 2 small felted animals and have plans for lots more projects. Thanks for providing this paradise for all of us creative beings.
__label__1	"Do not purchase the lobster roll or the oysters on the half shell. Absolutely the worst I have ever tasted anywhere. That is not real lobster that they sell at an exorbitant price. I was told by an employee that it is a lobster mixture. Of the 6 oysters I also purchased, 3 of them were dry and dead, although they are advertised as fresh. Stella, the manager has offered me a gift card when I bring that mess back, but if I don't get a full refund, the mess is going to a lab.
Anonymous"
__label__2	"Pros: Fast service, delicious garlic knots.

Cons: The woman who initially took our order A) got my order wrong, leaving off a topping and B) rolled her eyes at me and my boyfriend when we didn't have an immediate answer about what we wanted to drink. The pizza is very underwhelming and swimming in grease. The available tables were dirty; I ended up cleaning our table myself.

If I ever eat here again, it will be takeout garlic knots and maybe a sub. I would not get their pizza and can't recommend this restaurant."
__label__5	I always love to take my hungry hungry nephew here! He plays Strong Safety for the New York giants and comes to visit me! He's injured now hurt his hamstring so the least I could do is buy him some bagels!
__label__2	"Pork was okay. Collards were still in giant pieces and pretty flavorless. Mac and cheese was decent. Cornbread was sweet. 

There are plenty of better bbq options."
__label__2	The only good thing about this place was that you good sir on the balcony and see bourbon st below. Food was bland and overpriced. Our waitress didn't say a single word to us until we signed the check. What's even more odd is that she stood in front of our table to see what was going on below, but couldn't bother taking our order without us asking.
__label__4	Wait staff is iffy but they do get slamed. However food is normally awsome and at a good price point to take a family of 4. I really enjoy there foods and if I desire a nice drink as well.
__label__5	This is just as good as the Virginia Beach location! On Sunday be prepared for a line. However, they do a good job keeping the line moving so your wait time won't be too long. They make 1 type of donut, and then you can choose any combination of toppings available. It's under $2 for a donut, and you can watch your creation being made - from the frying of the donut to it being boxed and decorated. The coffee is good too.
__label__5	What an amazing experience! The food is absolutely on point. Oh yeah, and they sing the most beautiful songs that will take you away to a better place while you enjoy your dinner.
__label__5	This is the first time we ordered food here and was hoping for a good Asian cuisine but what we just had was just excellent! We ordered Katsudon and red curry, both were incredible! The red curry had tender, buttery chicken and was a little spicy, but not too much. It had a subtle sweetness and is an amazing comfort food. The katsudon was incredible as well, with a crispy outside and very tender pork. We will definitely be back, probably very often!
__label__4	I went to The Granada Theatre to watch and listen to a live performance required by my music professor. I mention the concert was required because I want to emphasize that even though I'm neither a music major nor a fan of operatic music, I was still able to recognize and appreciate the majesty of this historic theater and the great talent it provides for the Santa Barbara community. The performer was Joyce DiDonato, a Grammy Award winning vocalist! Her lovely voice projected beautifully throughout the opulent, gold-toned interior of the theater. If you're looking to spend a nice, maybe even elegant evening downtown, try here!
__label__1	So what is the story here? Ordered 2 days in a row on Seamless/Grubhub. Both days order was canceled by service. Really liked the choices but can seem to get the food. Strange.
__label__1	Workers aren't wearing their masks properly. I told them about it. They fixed them and when I looked again they weren't right. I won't be back.
__label__1	Drove by and saw lots of people outside so I called to see if there was a wait time or something. Lady answered and said yes but she didn't know what the wait time was. I asked her for a rough estimate and she hung up on me! Needless to say my husband said we are not going there. Smh
__label__4	"Two words: Garlic Knots!

I LOVE those things. So delicious. Whenever we go, we order dozens of them. Yes, I said dozens. They are that good. The pizza is pretty tastey, and the chicken pastina soup is very good. I love coming to this place with my family, its always a good time!"
__label__5	The king of all bakery donut shops. Hands down the best donuts Ive ever had, better than Titus in Lebanon and Hillegoss in Brownsburg. Make sure you are not In a hurry. The line is often out the door 30 minutes to an hour wait. It's totally worth the wait. The prices are very low. We usually get half a dozen donuts, brownies or cookies for less than 8.00. The peanut butter brownie tastes like a Reese's Cup. The Carmel nut and Apple fry Donuts and yeast are insanely amazing. Cash only no debit!
__label__3	ordered a grilled ham and swiss for pick-up. was ready on time. Nothing special about the sandwich but not bad either. could have been more generous with the ham. threw some chips in there which i wasn't expecting, so that was nice. would recommend this place when you get the nightime munchies and there aren't a lot of options. the milkshakes are spot on. give this place a chance
__label__5	Best breakfast I've had in Reno. So glad I passed on the buffet. Food was great, service was excellent. Next time I come back to Reno, I'll definitely be having breakfast here!
__label__5	"I've come here to see Jenell, but I've been following her for 2 years now from salon to salon. She's never disappointed. She has a ton of experience, her specialty is razor cutting hair and beautiful unicorn rainbow vibrant colors! Definitely get in with her if you need a magical unicorn hair lady boss!
As for the facility itself, it's super gorgeous: modern with metal and wood pieces. The light is amazing, there's plants...just an all around great vibe. Located in midtown with it's own private lot. 
So go see Jenell!"
__label__3	We arrived in New Orleans around 11 o clock and we stopped by for brunch/lunch. She had the jambalaya and I had the gumbo. The gumbo was amazing and excelled in spices, flavor, and texture/consistency. The only thing I didn't like was that it didn't come in a bigger bowl. the French bread that came with our meal was very hard and may be fresher softer bread in the morning for breakfast. The jambalaya my girlfriend was super cold right when it came to our table. so that's why I give his place three stars.
__label__2	Worst PF around bad cook. Service is ok but not good enough to compensate the bad cook. The Mongolian beaf meat horrible taste a hard as a rock. Rice was mushy. I decide not support this place any more.
__label__1	You can tell as soon as day shift leaves. They turn the music up really really loud. Couldn't hear myself think. They have too much fun cutting up with each other that the customers are ignored. The cook's brother was their visiting and I pretty much got ignored. They are young and immature on the night shift. And very unprofessional
__label__4	"I've been here a handful of times for the great beers but I just recently ate here and the food was good. It's a nice bar and service is always good. 

For dinner my friend and I shared a few things. Chicken wings- eh.. Neither good nor bad. Just whatever. Fried pickles- awesome! Highly recommend these. And the Sally Smothers burger. Yumm. It was slightly cooked over our desired temperature but it was still delicious. It's topped with a fried egg, pancetta and fried shallots! 

Awesome beer bar too"
__label__1	I was going to give this 3 stars because I thought it was just average....until the food poisoning set in. Thank you so much for a fun evening.
__label__2	"We had lunch here yesterday. The place was not crowded but the service was incredibly slow. We get better service from our local pizza shop. We had 2 courses and it took nearly two hours. My wife had the fish of the day which she liked. I had the lobster club that tasted like it made by a caterer, not a fine dining establishment. 
To top this the waitress added 20% to our credit card (I checked online) even though I only put 10% due to the poor service."
__label__1	Sadly this is the first negative Yelp review I've written ever.  Being the closest fuel source to our home, it's our first choice.  But we always have trouble here.  Broken pumps. Broken credit card reader.  Nine times out of ten we can't get a receipt.  I'm amazed at all the other positive reviews.  So I gave it another try today, and the pump would not take credit cards!!! My husband said, write Yelp!!!
__label__4	I really liked Atlas.  The service was good, the food was really good, and I liked the laid-back atmosphere but very tasty food.  The gnocchi appetizer is amazing.  I think I'm going to order that for my main dish next time, just so I can hog it all to myself!
__label__5	"Just moved to the area and gave this place a try.  It was GREAT! First Asian massage place that I feel like the girl knew what she was doing.  The place is not fancy, but neither are the prices.  1 hour for $65, totally worth it! I felt sooo relaxed leaving, will be back! 
Bonus they give you a nice Chinese cracker,  a macaroon biscuit, and water"
__label__5	The Gospel Brunch went beyond our expectations! The buffet was delicious quality food. Incredible variety of food and attentive staff. The performers/gospel singers were excellent- professional level talent!  Good audience involvement. If you don't feel incredibly happy, well-fed with food and Holy Spirit when you leave, it's yo own fault.  They provide the inspiration! I can't wait to return!
__label__4	Was a little disppointed to learn that Dr. Delacruz has moved on to pursue other ventures and I wish him well. It seems that The Joint is going through a transition period of having to find someone else to fill his shoes; this will be tough to do as Dr. Delacruz had a passion for what he did for his customers and always took time to speak with his patients because he cared... His expertise and kind heart will be missed by many of his patients.... Best of luck on your new ventures Dr. Delacruz.
__label__5	With all the great 5 star reviews already, I'm not going to waste time saying what everyone else has said already, except for this place has to be one of the best Italian restaurants on the east coast. I have been up and down the coast and you just can't beat the food and service here. Everything was excellent all the time. Just feels like home!
__label__2	"Been here a few times since the original review and again tonight. This place is so good. But again, 2 adults and 2 kids....we get 4 apps and then two of us share one of the dishes and get that ""sharing charge"". We had too much food and brought some home. That sharing charge is so ""amatuer hour"" for an otherwise excellent restaurant. 2 stars for that (would have been a solid 4)."
__label__5	the shrimp and grits are of exeptonal quality and pair quite nicely with the plethora of drinks and starters. The grits are very buttery and pair well with the sause it's served in as well as the shrimp giving it a tangy after taste.
__label__1	Garbage, low quality food. Everything is made from low grade ingredients.  The grilled romaine salad tastes like propane. Pasta is NOT homemade. Sauces are made with very bad quality meat, fish was simply mushy and disgusting. Save your money. Save your time. This place should be closed. Awful, awful experience. NEVER again..
__label__1	Needs to hire someone that can multitask!! I've called 3 times tonight and have been placed on hold for more than 5 minutes each time. I'll take my business elsewhere. Sorry Az pizza
__label__5	Speedy, secure internet. REALLY tasty iced tea (with cheap refills). The folks behind the counter are affable and seem like they're having a great time. The space is wide-open, well lit, and chic. Good music selection. Dog-friendly. Nothing not to love!
__label__1	horrible when i say horrible i been horrible worst experience ever last time i came in the owner (chef) argued with me over purchasing extra rice ! and no body answers the phone so the phone number is posted but they will never answer not matter how many times you call ¡absurd!
__label__4	Rat pack ambiance and super service. We had no Rez for a party of 8 and only waited 10 min. Food was great. Ladies bathroom is worth the visit just checking out the wallpaper.  Our party had prime rib & sea bass, which got big raves; grouper was good but not off the charts. Definitely worth checking out when looking for a change from Music Row fried fare.
__label__4	"Great pizza, worth the cost.

Service from the building owner was nice and chill, super relaxed but friendly.

It's a good building (love the carpet, the wood, good tables), but I think you could cheaply spruce it up with some paint, maybe hubcaps/rims on the wall, and some neon lights. Really boost that ""arcade"" game room feel. :) I think that would look AMAZING in there.

It's also draw a nostalgic older crowd, as well as a safe environment for kids to come after school and get some pizza!"
__label__1	The girl that waited only me was very pleasant but they couldn't provide me a digital passport photo. And they didn't offer me a solution or my money back when the consulate rejected the scanned photo. What a joke. This is a place that offers passport photos as one of their main selling points but in 2020 they couldn't provide a digital option. Ridiculous. If you need digital passports don't go here.
__label__3	"Rather average. The bartender was great, but we waited on our food quite a long time, and it wasn't crowded. When we got it, it was not all that great. My boyfriend and I split the cuchon de lait since we'd just eaten king cake samples, and the food wasn't as hot as we expected. I found it too heavy on the sauce, as well. The onion rings were fantastic, though!
Come for the bar, not the food."
__label__4	"Most definitely the largest selection of craft beer you will find in Carmel. I typically have luck finding the notoriously rare ""Gumball Head"" here. My only complaint is the service is average and the beer is over priced. I understand it is craft, but mostly $7 pints is too much for me to give them 5 stars."
__label__5	I went here following a recommendation from a Professional Numismatists Guild (PNG) member and I'm so glad that I did. Based on another quote, the owner gave me a fair price but it was his sincerity and integrity that struck me. He is honest and forthright and truly knows his coins. I felt like I was treated with fairness, professionalism, and kindness. I highly recommend Drexel Hill Rair Coin!
__label__5	Lovelovelove. Eclectic store with a lot of personality and an array of items. You can find everything here. I've scored on clothing multiple times. Would highly highly recommend this store to anyone and it's always my #1 stop when I'm in Philly. Also love that the $$ goes to a good cause.
__label__4	This pizza place met expectations and is a good place to try.  The crust is light and thin and doesn't make you feel so heavy.  Load up on the ingredients but itll get pricey for ya.  But I did enjoy the pesto pizza we had with chicken and artichoke hearts.  Nice atmosphere and friendly, helpful staff.
__label__5	Took my vehicle here for some insurance covered repairs and Chris was awesome to work with.  He handled the insurance approvals and direct payment while keeping me updated by phone throughout the whole repair process. When I picked up my truck it was detailed and the repairs were flawless. I'm thankful for their level of service and will be my first choice for any future repairs.
__label__1	I was trying to find out where Metro Spa went and the girl who answered the phone would not tell me. After some back and forth and after she tried to book me with somebody there that I didn't want, she finally gave me the phone number. turns out metro is just a block away!  that could have been alot easier. I was not impressed with the way I was handled.
__label__4	This place is great! Very clean and spacious. Before you touch and of the colors you must wash and sanitize your hands. They are flexible and kinda in their own corner in the shopping center. We will be going back without a doubt.
__label__4	Food was excellent!  Would definitely recommend.  Just be prepared to wait.  Wish they had benches or chairs to sit in outside while waiting, my parents are seniors and had to stand for 45 minutes.
__label__4	Was craving some pho so I decided to try this place rather than my regular pho restaurant. I was pleasantly surprised. It is relatively large with two dining rooms. There are tvs throughout and they had football games on a sunday night. The pho was reasonable, large and delicious! The amount of meat in the pho was a bit skimpier than my regular place for the same price, however it was still good. We also split a noddle dish, I cannot remember which one. The noodles were delicious and it was a reasonable size. I will definitely return.
__label__5	Very nice first apartment.  Close to Drexel for my graduate studies and center city.  I really enjoy the powelton area as well.  Management is very responsive and easy to work with.
__label__1	"Worst service ever.

When you walk in the servers and bartenders act like don't know why you have come. 

You sit down for them to not have drinks or food that their menu shows. 

Been their twice recently after not going for over a year. Same story. 

Wish I could order their food at another place downtown with out having to deal poor management.

If you go, ask questions upfront about the menu because they won't be forthcoming and it would be better to not have your hopes shattered."
__label__5	I had my triple forward helix done at Straight to The Point 2 years ago. I always thought the lowest piercing was too close to the middle one, so when the jewelry fell out, I didn't replace it and let it close. Yesterday, Hector fixed the location of the lowest piercing to get the look had originally been going for. He also swapped out all the jewelry. It's perfect and I finally love it!
__label__4	This place is awesome but sadly it is closing down!!  We will miss our beloved Wed meal deal.
__label__4	Fresh, delicious breakfast. Everything from the eggs to the jam to the coffee was spot on and amazing, not to mention the food came out SO fast. Couldn't believe it. Had a chance to sit outside on a gorgeous day which only added to the great experience. I would recommend to anyone!
__label__5	Finally, I found a tailor in Philly.  I took two jackets here to be fixed after they had almost been destroyed by another tailor. Check my reviews for the name of that place.  The jackets are now perfect. Excellent professional work.  I was confident he could make them a little better but  to my pleasant surprise they now fit like they were custom made from scratch. I am amazed
__label__5	Very clean. They are taking all cleaning and safety precautions. All staff was very nice and attentive, nice to see them supporting their local community. They have a large menu. Food was done quickly and was very delicious. Would definitely recommend and come again. Maybe even later tonight for the Nelsons ice cream!
__label__4	Amazing flavor for my udon and brisket . Would have 5 starred but I was served room temp. I would have preferred 10-20 degrees warmer but I am a snob. This place is delicious
__label__5	Great place for lunch, snacks, beer or small grocery needs. The deli is excellent with good prices and great quality meats. Different lunch specials everyday that never disappoint. Always a friendly staff as well!
__label__5	"Tried the ""Rita"" pizza yesterday and it was great! What a nice surprise, as the previous pizza place was pretty underwhelming. The crust wAs a big highlight for me - crunchy and had sesame seeds on the bottom. It's more expensive than most other local places, but it's different too - more high end ingredients. We'll be back!"
__label__1	"Not sure if this will be a valid review since we did not even make it through the door. I made a reservation for Father's Day...only to show up to a sign on the door that indicated it was closed for ""electrical issues"". I was amongst many who brought their dad here to celebrate and left disappointed. We spent an hour looking for any other breakfast place and eventually settled in Dunkin. I felt horrible that the one thing my husband was looking forward to for his day was ruined. No notice or anything."
__label__4	Great margaritas!  Very good service always.  Wonderful menu. This restaurant has been a favourite for over 15 years!
__label__4	The crawfish and soft shell crab were delicious.  The deep fried potatoes were great also.  Nice little place that has some local beer and huge sandwiches.
__label__1	I'm usually a very patient person but after calling here and having the same dimwitted half asleep dispatcher hang up on me 3 times I had enough. Horrible service.
__label__5	"Best Chinese takeout in St Louis! So glad they expanded their delivery area to include my neighborhood.

I highly recommend the Egg Rolls, (smaller and crispy, like you get at a lot of Thai places,) and the Hot Braised Chicken is sort of the house specialty - if you like a little spice (think better General Tso's) definitely check it out!"
__label__4	Very close to our hotel, within walking distance, and close to several other restaurants but I'm glad we chose LongHorn.  Mr Greg Froelich welcomed us and ensured that the dinner was to our satisfaction, and it was all good, and we will definitely come again!
__label__5	They did a great job with my nails and were able to fit me in last minute on a Saturday. I'll definitely be coming back.
__label__1	If I could give 0 stars I would. Terrible service & rude. Avoid this place at all costs!!! For good service I recommend infinity nail spa!!
__label__3	"It's all about the service and then of course the food.

Went for lunch this week the service wasn't that great and thr food was typical pub food.  

We had the lettuce rolls which we've had better after being served the waitress never came back to ask us how our meals were ... we've been before and it appears that now they have been open for several months the quality in customer service is not that important anymore."
__label__5	"The food and service is phenomenal. You can not go wrong with your choice. 
Food- crab beignets, tuna, scallops, short ribs, Brussel sprouts, snap peas
Drinks- The Overnight Saint-Sation and Rotari Brut Rose. 
Desserts- We has the bread pudding and Cracker Jack popcorn dessert-both unbelievable. 
The service is impeccable-i would like to recognize Travis, Sheldon, Colin, Sierra & Deshawn. They made the experience unforgettable. 
We liked it so much we dined with them twice in one trip."
__label__4	3 dollars for basic car wash and 6 dollars for delux! The place is big and clean.
__label__3	Too greasy for me! Have your Heartburn medicine ready after eating here. I didn't understand what the hype was about.
__label__5	Stop. Nashville, chips and salsa don't just happen like this in the world. Really. I took that 21 hour flight to Melbourne, AND THE DON'T. Eat it while you can. Throw in the shrimp taco sided by a fish taco. DO IT NOW. MAKE YOUR ANCESTORS HAPPY.
__label__5	"Great little spot tucked away behind the hotel. You have to walk through the valet circle to find this place.

Once you're inside ambience is wonderful. There's a nice jazz band in the cocktails are phenomenal. I also had the oyster salad which was great 

Brooklyn cocktail was also solid. 

I would definitely come back"
__label__5	Unbelievably amazing. I didn't think this level of food, presentation, and service was available in Delaware. They have an insane wine collection, but for the novice they also have several flights which make it easy to try something new or keep to your favorites. We did the pre fix option which was a great deal for the quality of the food.
__label__5	It was my first time surfing and was a little scared. I was so impressed with every aspect of the surf lesson and I had the best time surfing for my first time. I was able to get up and several times and felt like a pro it was amazing! Pike is such an awesome teacher and I had a better time surfing than I have ever had wake boarding or any other water sport. If you want to learn howe to surf and want an great experience than use this surf school you wont be let down.
__label__5	Got to the store within an hour of close. It was busy but found a place to sit  quickly. The muffuletta was awesome! Definitely enough for 2 per
__label__1	"I've had many problems with TD bank in the past. For example, twice they deposited my money in someone else's account. TWICE! Thankfully I keep my deposit slips. Finally I broke up with them. Today I had to go there to cash a check. $10. Seriously? Why am I paying them for cashing a check? 
TD Bank, you suck!!!"
__label__1	"Been a customer for 20 years both personal and business. Needed one page notorized. Just waited in the lobby for 30 minutes no one paid attention to me. Finally someone acknowledged me and said I needed an appointment for a five minute notary. Why didn't someone tell me that when I walked in.

Other banks do not require an appointment.

I also use SUN COAST for personal I think it's time to switch all my personal and company business there"
__label__5	They take credit card and have a pretty organized system where your phone number is matched up to your clothing. Everything came out pretty clean and the presentation is good. Prices are pretty fair, around $2 a shirt and $5 for pants. Also convenient that they have a UPS access point here. Good location.
__label__5	Wowzer!  This place is awesome!  We had the fajita bowl, one with chicken and one with gyro meat. Everything was fresh, cooked perfectly and nicely portioned.  The meat was plentiful as was the rice, beans and grilled veggies.  We will definitely be back.  First time here, first impressions are everything and you guys earned an A+ rating!!
__label__4	Great beer selection here. I heard the crowd can get crazy so I went at an off time. Found a seat at the bar and was impressed with the draft and bottle selection on hand.
__label__3	A mixed bag and regardless of what's ordered it is often too sweet. I realize palm sugar is a mainstay of Thai cooking but it's out of control. Service is always very good.
__label__5	Absolutely love our new gate! We sent Rene a picture of a gate we liked and he made ours just like the picture. I'm sure he can make anything anyone wants. The installation was quick and they didn't make a mess. Now our 1 year old can't escape our front courtyard area because we have our beautiful gate. We will definitely look forward to having him do more iron work at our home soon.
__label__5	"Thanks Brian for the awesome customer service! We are out of town and heading home now after not eating for HOURS. We were feeling sandwiches so we yelp here with awesome reviews. So here we are lol. 
Great customer service and great employees that helped us pick out the right Sandwhich. 
20inch Sandwhich OMG YASSSS.
THEY TASTE GREAT FOR THE PRICE!"
__label__5	Such a fun place for strawberry picking! Great vibe, friendly staff and WONDERFUL strawberries!
__label__5	"We came here tonight I called earlier to get reservations but they were all booked up and Larry squeezed us in party of six with three children.
We started with calamari the strawberry salad and the muscles and red sauce which were all perfectly done.
We all want to try something different so we did from specials Seabass with scallops to down to the basic chicken marsala and everything was awesome we all traded!
The vodka sauce was exceptionally good and I am a vodka sauce connoisseur!!"
__label__5	"I have to say a big thank you to theses people. I came in after my eye exam next door and found them to be very efficient and customer service oriented. Each customer was greeted Immediately and they were already assisting 4 customers before me. 

Lee was always moving and ensuring all were fitted with their glasses properly.  I want to say thank you for the excellent service I received from start to finish. I will return."
__label__1	"What a joke. Disgusting pizza. If you're giving this place high marks then I feel sorry that you don't know what pizza is.  The primary problem with Tony's pizza is the crust is like cardboard: hard, dry, tasteless.  Either they don't use yeast in their dough or its just extremely old and went flat.  Also their sauce is tasteless and doesn't give any depth to the pizza flavor.      
This is no better than Papa Johns.  Skip this place."
__label__5	I believe they go by a different name now. It's now the route 130 diner. Foods great and really cheap. All the southern favorites here. Seating could be better.
__label__5	Went today for an amazing massage from Jennifer.  She stayed late just to fit me in.  Most amazing massage ever.  My wife had a lot of tension in her neck and came out feeling great and totally refreshed.  I'd recommend this place to anyone and if you can request her, Jennifer is the best.
__label__5	Wow, this place has been many different restaurants o er the years. Mostly just so so bar food and good drinks but my family and friends ate here for dinner and boy did we have one of the best meals ever.  Service was exceptional and we all had great time. I can only hope that this place survives the time... Great job Teddy's crew,  Grandma would be proud..
__label__4	"Let me put it this way: if I lived downtown, I would be hear all the time. As it stands, I've only been there twice for business lunches, where I really couldn't ""get down"" like I wanted to. I thoroughly enjoyed the food, which strikes me as authentic though I have absolutely no way of verifying that. I also love the layout and design of the restaurant which feels open and cozy all at once. 

One of these days, I'm going to get my wife down there for dinner and drinks, so they can earn their 5th star."
__label__4	"Super delivery at the Indiana State Museum.  Thanks Artie for the simply simple BBQ sauce you gave to take home.  Used it tonight for enchiladas. Pressured chicken thighs in green sauce wrapped in rice with caramelized onions.  Topped it with your 'Q sauce.  Perfect.  
I know the rice isn't exactly Paleo, but your flavors married well with our meal.
Thanks!"
__label__5	I'm somewhat of a froyo connoisseur. :-)  Checked out Orange Leaf since I was in town on business, last night.  It was delicious.  I love the creamy ice-cream like texture.  Some places make a crystallized yogurt that's more like sherbet.  This was not like that.  First shop I've seen too with bottoms, and not just tops, being offered.  I had peanut butter, coffee, and cheesecake.  Yum!!!
__label__5	"Love this hip Fountain Square bar that has the best vibes - fun lighting, exposed brick and open concept with the bar in the middle. 

Come for the:
- affordable cocktails and cheap canned beer
- super unique menu items that change seasonally

Their patio has room for you and a couple of friends, but they also have lots of booth options and table options that feel al fresco with the open windows. 

Most recently for their food menu I enjoyed the incredibly refreshing watermelon salad. Did I mention it's super easy to walk to?"
__label__2	Despite multiple postings that the cars were being cleaned thoroughly due to Covid, the car we rented was disgusting. Smelled my old cigarettes, stains all over the ceiling and seats, and food looking goo on the buttons and door. It was quite disgusting and honestly looked like it hadn't been cleaned at all. At drop-off they offered a voucher for money off of next rental after we complained, however we will never be renting from hertz again.
__label__4	Let's start with the cupcakes.  The cupcakes are the size of softballs and there pretty good.  I like how they come out with different cupcakes every month.  The foods not bad a little pricey for what you get.  I got the goldie brisket sandwich melted onions but I didn't see any one there.  The horseradish sauce was good.  But a sandwich and chips for $9.  I like how they have windows you can look in and watch them make the cupcakes.
__label__2	We booked for New Years Eve expecting fine dining. What we got was something entirely different. Our wobbly table in the center of the dining room - where every patron walked right by us. Guess what - I got Covid. I shit you not. The food - average. Seriously for a steakhouse to serve up that?  It reminded me of Ponderosa.  I ordered the $16 upgrade of shrimp stuffed w crabmeat.  3 little shrimp that were over cooked. Sullivan's is sad.
__label__5	We spent my 64 birthday there last weekend with my wife, daughters and son in laws.  This was my 2nd time back and it did not disappoint.  Great atmosphere.  Love the old Hollywood feel.  The food is delicious and just the right portions.  The only negative was a few of the dishes came out  just warm.
__label__4	I've tried a lot of self-serve frozen yogurt places but this one is my favorite. I love the Brownie Batter flavor. Service is a bit slow at times, only because the ladies working the counter also have to man the Starbucks next door. Still, very friendly and very delicious.
__label__5	"Love my hair cut so easy to take care of now! 
The
Hairdresser knew exactly what I wanted too!
Friendly atmosphere! And fun music too!"
__label__4	"Good food,Huge portion 
I just wish they have a server to assist everyone in their orders."
__label__5	"I stayed in the Hotel across the street and had Breakfast here every day. Excellent ! The Wait Staff deserves 6 stars. Outstanding selection of coffee and beer. My friend and I had appetizers here one night when we were not too hungry. I did have Dinner the first night. It was ""the Special;"" Braised Beef Ribs with spaetzles. I liked to sit in here in the mornings, drink coffee and read a book since I am a morning person and my companion is a night owl.

This place is outstanding"
__label__5	I went in for some highlights and a few purple strands and I'm so amazed how my hair came out! Eric was my dresser extraordinaire and he was amazing with my hair. It was a wonderful experience overall the employees/artists all work together to enhance your experience as well as help out the very busy demands of the salon. I can't wait to go back, I felt like royalty.
__label__5	Their buffalo chicken pizza is to die for. Really really good chicken which is hard to find on buff chix slices. This place is a good find in a town crowded w pizza places. An underrated business. Maybe if they were more in the center of town with the drunk crowd, they would get more of the attention they deserve
__label__5	First time in NO and we decided to try Jimmy J's for breakfast. Hubby and I both got the Crab cakes Benedict.  It was delicious, so much so we had to have breakfast there the day we left. Thanks for the great service Jessie both days we stopped in.
__label__1	"The most average experience from start to finish. Our appetizer took over 30 minutes to get to the table, and it was incorrect. After the appetizer was corrected, it only arrived about 5 minutes prior to the meal. Despite that, I was still charged full price for the appetizer. The pulled pork sandwich I had was very bland and the bun was soggy. 

If you're looking for a place to spend $50-70 dollars for 2 for overpriced food and be underwhelmed, look no farther."
__label__5	Top 5 burger of my life! Also, I have a gluten allergy, which they take seriously and have many options. I'll be recommending it to all my friends!
__label__5	We stopped by here because it was right outside our hotel. The coffee was super yummy and really liked hanging out in the front near the window to people watch. Great way to start off your day!
__label__5	Oooh, I adored this market. So much to see, fantastic prices and really friendly staff.
__label__3	"Hmmm.. Not quite sure what it is about this place that keeps me coming...
Actually, it's probably the stiff drinks and the fact that it's down the street from me.. 
I have rarely received friendly service from the bartenders and that's my biggest complaint. Otherwise, it's charming for a dive bar and they allow dogs which is very cool. They also offer free popcorn, and that is quite nice when one finds oneself afflicted with the drunchies. Worth a stop if you like funky places, just don't expect too much."
__label__5	"How can someone hate Sly's, but love Lucky's? I don't know, but trust me, it's possible. 

I think it's the atmosphere at Lucky's-it's like Cheers, but not a dive-- is it's biggest draw. The lights on the ceiling were warm and welcoming, in fact the whole place FEELS warm and welcoming. Our server was GREAT, my salmon was cooked perfectly. We sat in the bar (no reservations) and had a very nice dinner. I'd go back in a heart beat! Love Lucky's!"
__label__5	HIGHLY RECOMMEND.  My experience with Jose and Edwin was exceptional.  They helped redesign my irrigation (sprinkler) system that wasn't providing adequate coverage for my yard.  I was so impressed with their work that I've contracted them for a second larger landscaping project!
__label__5	This was the 1st time I've rented from Enterprise, I rented a car for the weekend and dropped it off today. Mr. Victor Blackwell was the gentleman that assisted me in turning in the vehicle. He was patient with me removing my items from the rental, friendly and courteous. I will definitely rent from this location again and refer my family and friends. Thank you for a great experience!
__label__5	Good food all around. Prices are also not bad at all. We chose to sit outside every time which was nice.
__label__5	I work in the Broad Ripple area. I use this quaint little cleaners weekly. Customer Service is very friendly and knowledgeable. If you are in this area and looking for a cleaners. Do give this place a chance.. You wont regret it.. You are treated more like family than a customer.. Stop by and see them.
__label__5	The best donuts and hot chocolate in STL.   Starbucks pales in comparison.  Also during the weekend, they are open really late. This location also has a drive thru which makes it very convenient to get food quickly!
__label__2	The service was not very good. We had to track down our waiter a couple times after waiting for him to come to the table to take our order. The food was just so/so. My wife's chicken and rice was really dry to the point it was crunchy. They also brought my step father in law the wrong food. Not the best Mediterranean food or experience I have had at a restaurant.
__label__5	This is my favorite restaurant! They have the best pancakes. The servers go above and beyond to make sure you are completely satisfied.
__label__5	I have been here several times, and have been to acupuncturists at other places as well.  The doctors here, all of whom trained as MD's in China, are excellent, with at least 8-12 years of training.  You get individualized attention, an individual room, and the cost is only $50, which is only a little more than a copay.
__label__4	I love Italian food and I had a great experience at this quaint byob restaurant. It reminded me of the little spots I went to when I visited Italy for the first time this summer. While just about every meal was phenomenal there, I had some gnocchi and I have to say it did not compare to the gnocchi I had at Giorgio's. I know it was a seasonal speciality added to the menu but I will it was a permanent item: the sweet potato gnocchi was amazing. Please bring it back!
__label__5	I've visited once before and loved the atmosphere and how friendly everyone who worked there was but this was my first time trying the food. It did not disappoint, the Cuban sandwich was AMAZING! And it's huge! I have enough for a 2nd meal which is also always Awesome! I've now also tried the ham and cheese sandwich and cbd brownies and omg just when I didn't think I could love this place anymore I do!
__label__4	Went there on a Sunday and there was a lot of customers. Customer service is great , food is good, just a typical breakfast... Love the Nutella crepe too... We will definitely come back again
__label__5	I don't know why all the reviews are bad. I went in late at night, around 10pm. My friend and I both ordered a caramel frozen coffee and I got a donut as well. The guy was so nice, our coffees were very good, and he gave us 2 donuts free of charge!! Great service.
__label__5	They had everything I was looking for and the customer service was awesome! I was able to find what I needed in a very short time. I will most definitely come back.
__label__4	As far as any Starbucks location goes - this is probably my favorite. The staff here are incredibly friendly and boy, are they fast! The store is usually fairly busy and parking isn't usually available unless you get there early in the day, which is fine if you work 9-5. The space is somewhat cramped, but better than it was prior to their renovation. Again - it's a Starbucks, but it has the best staff of any others I've visited in the past and better than others I visit out of convenience.
__label__5	Main Street Animal clinic is the best. Dr. Simpson and staff are very professional and compassionate with their patients and owners. Highly recommend.
__label__1	"My family and I were looking for a good place to eat around Clearwater. Unfortunately yelp disappointed me. This place is nowhere near ""4 stars"" in fact I'm going to give it one. Our ""fresh"" fish was giving off a strong odor which was making us a little hesitant to eat, but we did. Worst fish tacos I have ever had... Not only was the fish terrible but it gave me a stomach ache after eating it. This is your warning yelpers."
__label__5	My family and I are brunch enthusiast so we try to hit up every brunch place in the Downingtown, Exton and West Chester area and this place is one of my favorites. The food was amazing, atmosphere was great and service was fast. Prices are reasonable and there are a lot of options, what more can you ask for.
__label__5	A Nashville must. They move people in and out relatively fast, so even if the line is long you're good. Don't be afraid of the avocado Popsicle. It's my favorite. Super creamy.
__label__5	This is probably my favorite asian food in Idaho. My son and I Both are addicted to the egg rolls and the ninja chicken. They have a food truck that we try to catch if we are out at the fair or any big event in Boise, and they also have a brick and mortar spot in the village in meridian when we are really craving the food! If ya haven't tried them out yet you'll enjoy the flavors and the awesome staff as well!
__label__5	Diamond Nails is clean, the staff is friendly, and the pedicure was relaxing! My sister, my daughter (4) and I visited Diamond Nails on a Sunday around 11am. They had a wide selection of colors to choose from. We were offered water bottles, and their massage chairs were very comfortable and relaxing! I appreciated the fact that they use liners (one time use) in the pedicure tubs! The ladies were so friendly, and my daughter loved having her nails painted! We will be back!
__label__5	I'm a stylist at our Capitol View location and I just wanted to state how blessed I am to be surrounded by such a hard working, talented team. During this pandemic I wanted to make sure every salon is getting every ounce of support they deserve, especially this one! Brentwood Buttercups, you're amazin
__label__4	This place is cool. Nice people working behind the counter. I think the reason why I'm not giving it 5 stars is because it definitely was more expensive than I thought it would be with only one dollar sign. I ordered a Reuben that cost $9.45 before chips and a drink.it was good, but it was small and I was still hungry after. There are too many other places to get a sizable meal for the same price, if not less.
__label__1	Yeah, so I ordered my food three hours ago and have not yet received it. I also contacted customer support and 1.5 hours later I'm still awaiting a response there as well. I have no idea if this is a good restaurant or not as they literally just didn't deliver my food. So, delivery is zero stars!
__label__1	"Best Buy's Price Match Guarantee is a total joke. All retailers use different model numbers so you cannot price match. Exact same computer was $76.00 cheaper at Amazon. Went to Mt Juliet store. They could have cared less. I had all back up. Model number was off one letter. Was told that was Amazon number in same model but they would not match. Told me to get all my personal stuff off of computer and bring it back. 
Be sure and check Amazon before you buy."
__label__5	Great customer service. The atmosphere is very reminiscent of old New York Italian diners with its tiled ceilings, neon lights, and jazz in the background. Food is great and serving sizes are huge.
__label__4	"First time eating here. The fresh rolls were very good 10/10. Tried the chiang mai fried rice 7.5/10 and the pad Thai was kind of sweet even though we asked for it medium spicy 8.5/10. I also tried the sweet sticky rice with mango but I forgot to take a picture. Very good 9/10

The service was good. They have limited seating. Servers wear masks. Will come back!"
__label__3	Needs work. Great potential. Good menu, inexpensive wine. Service was a little slow. Overheard the owner describing his plans. Hope he can pull it off, I'd like to come back and see.
__label__2	I really wanted to like it. 1st the pics you see on this page and the website look nothing, I mean nothing like what I got. 2nd I seen the packages had microwave times on it. Ok good to know. But not really instructions on how to store,  defrost, then heat. Other companies I used seem to gave a freeze it 12 of un-thaling. Then microwave for 2 min oh high. Let stand 1. Not this one. All packages say heat high 1 to 2 mins. From eggs to steak.
__label__5	Delicious authentic food and friendly service. I had a little mix up with my order and they were more than accommodating to make up for it. Additionally the food is delicious! Please check them out! Great for a cold winter Sunday. Thank you!
__label__3	After my fist review of 2 stars. I am adding a star for the manor in the way the customer relations handled my phone call. In my first review I bashed the management for the service my wife and I had received on the Valentines Special. I will be returning soon and hope to have a much better experience to write about.
__label__5	Such a cute shop. Beautiful park across the street. Yummy coffee and sandwiches. Really good customer service.
__label__2	"Anthony,
The slices always look like they've been out all day, there is almost a rubber texture to the dried cheese. And there is very little variety between the pies that are out.

P.S.
Why would I message you? I simply post my unsolicited opinions on here. I have no interest in convincing you how bad the slices are or listening to you defend your pies....that's not my thing!

W.Yeats"
__label__5	Olivia was extremely helpful. I walked in clueless and left confident that I picked the best dress for my wedding.
__label__1	Worst Popeyes ever. Asked for mild chicken and the gave me cold spicy chicken. Damn kids couldn't even eat it. Called numerous times to speak with a manager and nobody answered the phone. A waste of $30... should've went to Publix. This ain't the first time
__label__2	"Over rated brewery.  Everything is overpriced.
Beer is good, nothing spectacular.
I still love the ambience however waiting time is terrible...We waited for 30 min to get our beer and eventually it was flat
I guess they don't care a lot since they are at a prime location."
__label__4	Pleasantly surprised with the value...We had a Groupon for Christmas Postcards and they turned out MUCH better than I would have expected.  The photo shoot was quick, roughly 15 minutes, but the photographer was great at coming up with fun poses, moving us around, shifting props and getting the job done efficiently.  (I wish I could remember her name, I think it was Sheree).  I'd definitely return.  We were pleased enough that we purchased additional photos to display around the house.
__label__2	Ok burgers really good shakes but the worst employee and very dirty. ;( I do have to say that kids eating free when u go in during the weekend helps but it just was not a good atmosphere at all.
__label__1	We had dinner at the Greenwood location. The chips were cold and old. The salsa is very sweet. Chicken dishes are all dark meat. Service was so-so.  The quality was below Taco Bell, and the price was very expensive for what you get. Sorry but I will never go back.
__label__5	"I loved the tomato poblano soup. That was my favorite one. 
Next was the other soup I can't remember I think it's the consume. 
I got the steak flank tacos and chicken tacos and everything was delicious ! Guac and chips too ! 
I am sad not to dine in like I used to but ah well. I remember the days of margaritas tacos and watching Football (soccer games) 
I can't believe I haven't posted until now but worth the pick up and take away. 
Dreaming of their poblano soup again"
__label__4	"this place is great! very informative and interactive. i really enjoyed my time here and highly recommend this to anyone that is a history or a museum buff. 

my only complaint is that it is very confusing to get around. i wish the map was a little bit better in explaining where you are and what you will be visiting."
__label__2	The place has good food but slow and inattentive service. Takes forever to get any help here and when we asked for a couple boxes for our load of food we wanted to take home, we received one small box to try to fit almost 12 wings into. Luckily I am only in Indianapolis for business today. If I'm ever in Indianapolis again, I will not be returning to this BWW.
__label__5	This is one of my favorite restaurant , yakisoba was very delicious and ramen was just right I Alway happy with their service ,, even sometime the restaurant was very busy but the server Always taking good care of us.. I want to give 5 star for the service ,
__label__4	Slowwww service for drinks and waitress to get drinks and check. The food is super fast and was very good. We had potstickers and dan dan noodles
__label__2	The buffalo wings I had here were ok.   The biscuits they give with the salads are nice too. I ordered a burger medium and it came out so over done.   The fries were soggy and not hot.  Maybe this was because I came with a group.  I had two bites of my sandwich and didn't bother to eat anymore. I came from out of town such a disappointment.  Don't bother coming here and save your money.
__label__4	I really enjoy this bar. They have great pub food, good bar tenders, outside seating, and a cool crowd. Try the grilled octopus... phenomenol!
__label__4	Peroshki here is awsome- especially the potato and vegetable one.  Also tried the fried version when I happened upon it just as they were brought out on a tray - the potato or beef one was delicious (a little greasy) but a tasty pleasure; however, I'm sure they are a million calories sure to bring out the food police... Had a russian friend who directed me here for the flakey cookies with almonds.
__label__5	This has been the best restaurant experience I have ever had. The Smiley Team is top tier at making sure everyone is happy and enjoying themselves. The beef pho is now my favorite in middle Tennessee. If you're ever in the area you should 100% try them out! They have an impressive variety of food.
__label__5	I wanted to say thank you to Ryan Murray. Ryan you always make me feel so much better when I bring my Santa Fe in. I get the best service and you show so much patience when I ask so many questions. I trust that you always treat me with respect and I appreciate it. Thanks and see you soon.  Lilly C
__label__5	Consistently delicious pizza & the best garlic knots in town.  Fantastic food & a hidden gem!!
__label__5	This was by far our favorite spot on Broadway!  It's worth braving the crowd even if you're not a broadway lover.
__label__3	Cafe Henri came highly recommended but we were disappointed. Food was mediocre and they were out of several mains. Service was rushed and unfriendly and we definitely didn't feel welcome. Sadly, my steak was overlooked and had a hair (yuck). Wish I loved it because the space was gorgeous and the intentions are strong. They need to work on service and food.
__label__5	"I chose this locksmith based on these great YELP reviews.

These guys want your work and go for it.  I needed a lock re-keyed for my 91 year old mother's (I live in Seattle) house.  

This was an emergency as her daughter was threatening her.

These got the job done within hours - superfast.

Nice guys!  Friendly!"
__label__3	Sticky chicken wings is a must. Rice with crispy hen is recommended. Grilled pork bun worth trying. Do not understand why panda waffle is green, looks unsavory but tastes not bad. When you order rice, you can exchange white rice for fried rice, much more tasty.
__label__1	"I don't get the good reviews for this place.  Went on a Sunday last winter and it was empty.  The waitress was .... just weird and awkward.  Made us very uncomfortable.  I had the Pad Thai, which is pretty hard to ruin.  It had no flavor, mushy noodles and was huge.  I asked for lime, and they had none (???). Even the hot sauces were bland.  I don't like super hot food, but some discernible flavor would be good.  

As I recall, it was also rather overpriced."
__label__1	"This was the worst experience I have ever had. 
Ordered a pizza through Grubhub and was told it would be delivered in 25 minutes. 
The establishment is 4 minutes away from me. 
It showed up 2 1/2 hours later. It was Cold and Burnt.Clearly not edible. 
When I tried to reach Rise Pies they wouldn't answer the phone. 
Very unacceptable and unprofessional. 
Very disappointed in Grub hub and who they hire to make deliveries. 
Not a happy customer"
__label__5	Tim did a great job on my remodel. His guys were on time every day. They were clean, nice and very professional. Tim was very helpful and really knew what he was doing.
__label__5	I got my two front windows tinted 3M yesterday and they did an awesome job and it comes with a 1 year warranty. They offer lifetime warranty ones too. Prices are affordable for the quality of the work. Trishia was great!! I also got a free TShirt which was super cool
__label__1	Very weird.. I had an interview which is them recording you for family's. I don't think it allows you to be yourself when you have to have a white back round so you look fake. I need heard anything back from my interview which I'm king of happy about because it seems like a scam!
__label__5	Have gone to Lisa K. for years because she always does a great job on color and cut. Cat adventure tales are an added bonus!
__label__5	These are some of the best tacos I've had! The menu is limited to just tacos, which is nice so you don't end up standing in line trying to figure out what you want. The line was out the door, and for good reason. The asada tacos were perfectly cooked and all three sauces were delicious! The line moved fast too and we didn't have to wait long for our food. Love this place! Wish they would put one in the desert!
__label__4	Delicious food and incredible ambiance. It was a little cold sitting by the windows but the yummy cocktails warmed me up quickly. Great service too!
__label__5	One gets plenty of food at Gino's and the wait staff is very prompt. The menu can be tailored to your liking which is a huge plus.
__label__4	Ordered tacos from here before my trip back to NY. Juicy, tangy, tasty, flavorful.
__label__5	I hope it reopens. Nunzios had a great food and service and was one of my top spots in Collingswood.
__label__4	If it wasn't for yelp I wouldn't have known there was such delectable food to be found within! Sure, I saw the sign from the street. No, I wasn't quite sure how to get there but then again why would I? It wasn't like I need tortillas at this moment.
__label__3	Good food but they refuse to honor the free lunch coupons I continue to get from Carrabba's main site. Very frustrating.
__label__4	"We had a really large group on a Wednesday night and we all had a great time. The place has a great ambiance and the staff were friendly and helpful. They accommodated our big group for a long time.

We will be definitely coming back."
__label__5	What really impressed me was the cleanliness. From the moment we walked in the door it was refreshing. Service was great. And the food speaks for itself. Everything we ordered was delicious, and it came up fast and hot. Be sure to try the ygang zhou fried rice. I probably didn't spell it right. It was awesome. I've had it other places in town, but it was more expensive elsewhere. Here it was two or three Bucks cheaper. And very light and refreshing with lots of goodies in it. I'm making this my go to for Chinese in this part of town.
__label__4	Without doubt the best steakhouse in Tucson.  That said terribly inconsistent.  Great staff and they always make it right, but i prefer to not have to complain.  This is not a cowboy steak joint.  Excellent Bar and service and great bar food.
__label__3	I had heard about this spot previously from a foodie, I had high hopes but unfortunately I have to compare the food to a Latin grocery store cafe. It was great looking and was good would definitely give them another try!
__label__1	If you're  a coffee  drinker and you're looking for  a real good coffee FORGET about this place. I have tasted coffee  from different parts of the world and so far this is the worst. The one they served was just warm not hot water with a little old coffee. You couldnt even taste and smell the aroma of the coffee. They are not even ashamed of asking a high price for a stale watery coffee. Frankly, the coffee  from the gas station taste much better than the one they have.
__label__5	So we we're supposed to go to Red Elephant for dinner, but we realized they were shut down. Found Flippers down the road. We had gone to the one in I Orlando a couple year ago. Let me tell you it's still as amazing as remember. Being cooked on the stone oven makes it amazing. We ordered three different pizzas and the meat one had huge pieces on it. The white pizza was just as good with spinach and tomatoes. We asked for the original crust and it was thin but not too thin and so crispy. Great place, great service
__label__4	Reasonable prices for good food! Also ordered the indian pancake which was tasty but I was disappointed with the portion size. Potstickers are $4 for 5 pieces. We went for lunch so prices weren't too bad. Only reason for 4 stars is I wasn't blown away. But if you're looking for a decent place with a variety of asian food for a reasonable price then definitely stop by!
__label__5	"I wish I'd found this place sooner. It's a perfect dive bar. The brothers, Doug and Ryan, are the nicest guys around. This place is totally unpretentious. The crowd is a mix of all ages. There's a dart board in the corner, and plenty of seats around the bar. There's always a game on the tv.

One things to keep in mind: they don't serve food, but you can bring in whatever you want."
__label__1	Incredible live jazz music! Bar food at best but the wait staff was very inexperienced! Needless to say service was severely lacking! 45mins before we saw our waiter, another 50mins before we got our cold meatloaf & chicken & waffles entrees. Blank stare when we brought it to the attention from the waiter. Amazing! Will never return.
__label__2	"Awesome layout. Standard service. Thin stout.

Note: they will not fill any outside growlers (only provide refills on their own growlers), even though theirs is the standard glass style/size. Massive turnoff."
__label__5	I recently had my SUV detailed @ Jules; Kaz was the primary technician working on my vehicle. I found Kaz, as well as the entire Jules Car Wash staff to be very courteous and very professional. I had no issue with the service provided and thought the fee was fair and reasonable. I will absolutely return to Jules. When I left, I felt like I was driving a brand new car.
__label__1	"Went for lunch. Ordered the meatloaf. It was a 5 oz pattie with an even smaller scoop of mashed potatoes on top and a lb and a half of plain steamed green beans. 
Fifteen dollars. Are you fucking kidding me. Never again."
__label__3	Cute little cafe with good food & a good variety. The location is great. Not always the best breakfast I've ever had, but never been bad ~ thumbs up.
__label__4	I just got introduced to this store a few weeks ago, and I wish I'd heard about it way sooner! The store is very nice, and all of the staff that I spoke to the two times that I've visited this store were helpful. They have a great selection of cloths for men: casual, formal, luxury, etc. Would definitely recommend to any young professional looking to diversify their wardrobe on a budget.
__label__5	Love, love, love, love, love Burger Up Cool Springs! They are family-friendly and provide coloring pages and kids books for entertainment and bring out fries and apple slices during ordering so the kids can go ahead and eat. I usually can't talk myself out of getting the Bison Burger and sweet potato fries when I'm there, but when I can, the burger nachos, Woodstock burger and Pimento Cheese burger are AH-MAZ-ING. And as for other reviewers saying that it is expensive for a burger, it's certainly not expensive for organic, locally-sourced beef.
__label__5	A must. Fast, friendly service. Accepts cards. Half sandwiches are $5, whole sandwiches are $10. A half will fill you up. My favorite is the General Patton. All sandwiches are tasty. My rating 3 of 3 stars.
__label__5	I was able to get a last minute moving slot for the busiest time of the month! It was quick, swift, Alex and his team were prepared and I am so happy with this experience! truck fit a lot, they were able to accommodate my various heavy objects!  Highly recommend
__label__3	The portions are getting smaller,if you want your money's worth go to The Capri.The hot cakes are good. I would recommend it once in a while but not all the time .On the pricey side.They have too much turnover in employment that should tell you something about any business.Weekends are busy.
__label__5	Unless you are an irredeemable vegetarian, go here. Dont wait, go now. Be prepared to spend some time drooling over the unfathomable number of diffferent bacons trying in vain to make a choice. This place is literally a meat lovers heaven.
__label__4	"Love this place and their gelatos are the best!!! 
I always get the pistachio flavor. 
Sherbet was just so-so."
__label__5	"This is a great, small venue for all types of entertainment. I love that theater troupes without a home finally have one that is affordable, and the management TRULY understands how to make things run smoothly. 

Sometimes there are cocktail tables set up for a more intimate feeling, other times there are rows of seats. You never know what surprises will greet you at The Cat!

Parking is easy with all the parking garages in the area, and they serve beer and wine! There are several nearby restaurants for dinner before or a drink after. It's really a fun venue for a night out."
__label__1	Msg. Go here if it doesn't bother you. If it does, stay away. Good food and service and view, but if you have sensitivity to mono sodium glutamate after eating you will have headaches insatiable thirst and pass out
__label__5	There opening night and it was fantastic. Great food, service, atmosphere...everything. Ceviche was some of the best I've ever had. Neither me or my date drink, and the bartender made 2 different, BOTH delicious mocktails. This is a great date night place--WILL be back!
__label__5	Friendly and quick service. Never had a problem with any qdoba before and this location is no exception
__label__4	"Nice space but there are a few drawbacks.  The most noticeable is the lighting.  I get that they have a neat light show on their ceiling.  It was moderately interesting but lighting could have been better at the table level without interfering with the light show.  It was dark enough that it felt rather like a place where people go to hide instead of feeling like an upscale place to grab a drink.  

Service was mediocre at best.  I ordered three different drinks and each one was made wrong.  Maybe the lighting was to blame???"
__label__5	Love the location and if you have a dog get a ocean front room it's right across the street from the beach. Rooms are just ok but you can't beat the location!!
__label__3	Nice little coffee shop, coffee was good. They have a nice selection of vegan bakery items. I'm not vegan, and to be honest, I thought the vegan blueberry muffin was not very good. Also got an everything bagel, which was toasted exactly how I asked. And they put the cream cheese on the side so you can put on as much or little as you want. But the bagel was also a pretty bad bagel. I wouldn't go back for food, but I'd go again for coffee.
__label__4	Haven't been here in years and stopped by and picked up the Chicken/Salad. Very good. Not crowded and I guess it is due to the very cold temperature.
__label__5	I have seen Dr Dewhirst on 3 occasions. I found him to be professional, kind and exceptionally competent. His demeanor is quite and reserved but he has a sense of humor and his concern for your well being is genuine. His abilities have improved the quality of my life and I highly recommend his services. Only downside is the wait if you're a new patient.
__label__2	Really don't get the hype. WAY overpriced and average food. The veggie burger is the same frozen morningstar brand patty that Burger King uses. It is also two times smaller than the bun they put it on. Kind of a joke, really. Good service but not enough vegetarian or vegan options for us to ever go back.
__label__1	"Worst chinese food I've ever had. Very poor quality. Dumplings are filled with questionable ""mush."" Couldn't even eat one. Tastes like might be rotten. Don't order here. GROSS."
__label__1	I ordered pho to go, which I have done at other restaurants that usually give me great pho, however this restaurant gave me my noodles in a styrofoam container ( where am I supposed to pour the broth?) and raw meat. literally, they packed me some raw meat.
__label__4	"Interior: 7/10, Food: 9/10, Service: 9/10.

Got into New Orleans really late and drove around looking for something to eat around the French Quarter. Found Muriel's open and checked it out.

The food was great! Probably the best meal I had during my stay. I went to all the other places that the Zagat and Fromer's guide suggested, but finding Muriel's on my own was better than any of their recommendations.

Would I go back? Definitely."
__label__5	I started coming here in March for allergy testing followed by subsequent shots and have always been pleased with my treatment here. Dr. Margolis and her staff have always been professional and polite since my first visit. The wait time is always minimal and I get my shots without any issues. I would gladly recommend that others see Dr. Margolis.
__label__5	Joseph (DJ Flamezz) did an incredible job at our wedding. He kept everyone on the dance floor and was overall extremely attentive--quickly and seamlessly changing songs if he noticed people were leaving the dance floor (although this definitely didn't happen often!).  You will not regret going with Joseph (DJ Flamezz)! Young and old were all having a blast.
__label__5	Serial Grillers is so good & so unique. We love all the different choices we can get when eating here. We like to order a few of the mini pizzas that way we can try different ones.
__label__5	My son has a difficult time with haircuts. Trav's Barber Shop gave a great haircut and couldn't have been more accommodating.
__label__5	If you want to feel cared about and be surrounded by positivity, see Olia for your wedding dress! My stress melted away being in Olia's shop. She makes the experience personal.  Beautiful gowns, top notch skill in altering when needed.  I wish I had more excuses to work with these people. Final appointment coming up soon but I am confident everything will be perfect!
__label__4	One of the few places in the Reno area that serves boba drinks  (tapioca balls). Small little take out hut with friendly service. Delicious!
__label__4	Very relaxing atmosphere. Tasting wines here was a very unassuming experience. I had a great time. I'd definitely recommend this for happy hour or a pre-dinner glass.
__label__4	Their Deluxe Pour House burger is the best burger I've ever had and allow myself one a month. Booze is a little pricey except for their beers.
__label__5	Last weekend, I was in desperate need of an emergency color correction after an at-home box color fail. Aimee Kennedy took on the challenge when I called for a last-minute appointment . She took time to get familiar with my thick, long and course hair, looked at my before pics and my ideal color pic and worked miracles. A week later, The salon was extremely clean, all of the staff was friendly and I observed multiple talented stylists doing cool things to their clients' hair during the hours I was there. I'm really grateful to have stumbled upon this place-especially Aimee!
__label__3	i went here one late afternoon, rather hungry for having not eaten since the morning.  decided to order their chef's salad which turned out to be good, fresh, and filling.  the staff were also friendly.
__label__5	I somehow though I had already reviewed this. Doris is awesome, so are the pies. Priced very well. Find her at the farmers market. Especially the the bourbon pie. Yeah.
__label__1	I ordered a cake for Easter to be delivered in Ca.  I have been waiting to try their cakes and was super excited.  Unfortunately this cake could not be eaten as it was completely ruined. I contacted Caluda's many times by phone, text and email with no response.  I am out $57 for cake and shipping.  If you offer shipping then your product should be edible.
__label__3	I went here few years ago to get a case for my ukulele. The guy in the ukulele department was very nice helpful
__label__1	"Only edible items on the menu are under Chaat and beverages. Order anything else, you will repent.

We visited this evening and ordered Ragda Patis Chaat, Gobi Manchurian, Vada Pav, Falooda and Mango  shake. Vada paav and Mango shake were ok, rest of the items were really bad.

Gobi Manchurian had lot of vinegar, when I returned it they put a lot of sauce in it and gave it back. Worst Gobi Manchurian ever. There are too many options in the Fowler area. Stay away from this place."
__label__5	"We purchased 2 twin beds that have moveable bases and we absolutely love them- best beds ever. Andre was a fabulous sales person and so helpful and accommodating. One bed wasn't going to be in for at least 2 weeks and since we had scheduled someone to take our old bed we were disappointed to have to wait on one of the beds to come. Andre ""took the bull by the horns"" so to speak, called several warehouses and got us a bed in 3 days!!! Great service and product!! You should get your new bed here!!!"
__label__5	"Pastificio is unbelievable and stands up to any of the Philly titans (Sarcones, Paesano's, Chickies ect..) when  it comes tor sandwiches.

I am not going to get into the specifics of each sandwich I have had however I have never had anything less than a A+ eat here.  I will quickly say though that the Sausage Special is a top five sandwich in the city and off the meter good."
__label__3	"We eat here often and the food is good, but service is hit or miss. In fact,  I don't remember them ever getting our order right.

Worth a try if you don't mind flaky male servers."
__label__5	Best wings in town, nice size and the mild flavor is perfect heat! Every other hot chicken spot can't compare. Try it for your self you won't go anywhere else
__label__5	One of my favorite State parks! The trails have beautiful scenery that over look the river and cliff side. The hiking is mostly moderate difficulty level, but anyone that's heathy could definitely do the trail! The park is rarely so crowded it's miserable and there are hidden caves! Also a great back to bike or bring your dog.
__label__5	Make sure to sit at the sushi bar and have Hector make you sushi with some of the freshest fish around!!!!
__label__5	This is by far one of the best dealerships I've encountered. The staff is incredibly helpful and courteous. They have so far gone above and beyond to assist me with my Tacoma, which I didn't even buy from them. I will definitely bring my business to them in the future.
__label__5	"A friend dragged me to Tony's donut and I'm happy she did! It was a nice drive from my house but worth the drive The shop is small, but welcoming. I ordered a bacon, egg and cheese sandwich combo. It came with a drink and a donut. After some deep thought, I ordered a buttermilk glaze donut and it was delicious!

I'll be back! This is my new going to be my go to breakfast spot when I am flying out of town. The donuts are better and cheaper than dunkins in the airport."
__label__3	I ordered the vegetable Tom Yum and spicy eggplant with basil leaves. Tom Yum was quiet bland for my taste, not spicy or sour, but the basic flavor of Tom Yum is there. The eggplant was not bad, it's on the oily side for my taste, and could be more flavorful. Overall, the food is what you pay for. If you are looking for reasonably priced and mediocre Thai food, this is the place for you.
__label__5	Excellent service always great. Get coupons in April for $45.00 for future service. There is a hydro bed you can use for free any time every day!
__label__5	Amazing brewery. Beers are great and atmosphere is wonderful. Welcoming, knowledgeable and friendly staff. My husband and I ventured down to St. Petersburg during our trip to Orlando and this brewery alone made the trip worth it !
__label__5	We recently used Eager Beaver for our office move within Edm. The entire process, from quoting, to scheduling, to the move itself was as smooth & easy as any move can be. The 'moving men' were friendly, polite and careful with our furniture, equipment etc. They offered helpful advice, and even moved some items that weren't part of the original quote - w/o increasing costs! Choosing a mover can be a risky proposition, however Eager Beaver really stepped up and delivered. We highly recommend them.
__label__4	Was pretty good.  Loved the atmosphere.  The bartender needed to be a little more attentive as I had to practically throw my card at him to close out when our seat was ready.  The food was pretty good, but not amazing.  I like the location as it's easy to get to and not in the hustle and bustle of downtown.
__label__5	"PJ's always has the best seafood at the best prices. My whole family loves the fish, the fried clams, the blackened grouper and everything else - including the kitschy decor. 

Come early for dinner to get a good seat. The beer is cold and the food is delicious. We make a point to come here every time we're in the area."
__label__5	"Love, Love, Love this place!
Brought my soon to be I laws here and they liked it as much as my fiancé and I do.
I've never had a bad meal here, ever. 
The owner and servers never forget us!
I suggest you make 1 trip here and you will be hooked!"
__label__1	What a joke, insanely slow for something that comes out of a machine. 30+ min and doesn't answer phone... Come on
__label__5	Great pizza, I go out of my way when I'm in town to go here. Love the sesame seeds on the bottom!!
__label__5	Adorable restaurant in a great location. Excellent service. Great food. The OG waffle and Brown Sugar Cinnamon latte was amazing!
__label__3	Great food and super friendly server. However service extremely slow. Took an hour from time we sat down to time we got food and they weren't full there yet. So don't be in a hurry.
__label__2	"The food here was OK. I expected a lot more flavor from a joint that focuses on Vegan food. The ""cheesesteak"" literally tasted like ketchup and nothing else. I will give credit to the SP fries, they were excellent with the BB cilantro dip. As for the restaurant as a whole, I won't be back."
__label__5	Excellent food and atmosphere. The Shrimp burrito was amazing. Right at the edge of being too hot but never crossed that line! One of the best burritos I have ever had!
__label__3	Food was wonderful. I got the chicken with spicy maple butter and mixed greens. The service was sub-par at best. I get they're busy for brunch, but they should have food runners or drink runners ensuring that those who have ordered bottomless are truly getting BOTTOMLESS.
__label__1	Brand new location with brand new lazy unprofessional terrible staff and brand new awful service! I called while outside and saw them literally ignore my call. Then I go in to order 2 personal pans and they tell me 10 min. Lie. Took forever and they aren't even busy! Pizza was a over sauced mess. Save your money don't do it! This place sucks!
__label__2	The food was pretty good, I had the fish and chips and they were average, my brother got the jumbo crab cakes, while not jumbo it was good. One thing that was quite upsetting was their lack of men's toilets, one of them had the door missing and the other one was out of commission this was outrageous to me as I think a working toilet should be a given. Our waitress was okay, not the best I've had but not the worst...
__label__4	"This location is fast, friendly, and clean. The service is excellent even during peak hours. It can be very busy during these times but everything was well prepared. 

*Corporate fast food is scientifically proven to be detrimental to your health, but if you're going to eat toxic garbage, chick fil a is one of the best options."
__label__4	My favorite Greek restaurant!   My husband and I share the sampler and still take home leftovers!   Save room for baklava!   Opa!  Heard they are closing on 3/30/18.  So sad!
__label__5	We had a great experience with E&B Granite. Kevin and his crew worked with us to find a quality cabinet and quartz countertop for our bathroom that was affordable and exactly what we wanted.  Kevin went the extra mile to make sure everything went as smoothly as possible.  Everything was ready on time. We couldn't be happier and we highly recommend them.
__label__4	"Right where I'm typing now. Great location with excellent healthy food. Love their tomato soup! The place can get busy at lunch time, so get there early!
And give the staff a break! They don't have it easy!
The food is labeled for your dietary needs."
__label__5	My husband and I went here for dinner and ordered; I hadn't been feeling well and decided I would like the food to go. The manager and waiter went out of their way to make me feel comfortable and brought my food and check out immediately. Not only is the atmosphere and staff wonderful...the food was spectacular.
__label__5	I was picking up lunch to have at a friends and decided to try 813's Grilled Shrimp Salad and my friend wanted to try the Grilled Lobster Salad. These salads are wonderful: very generous portions of good healthy ingredients. We both had their balsamic vinaigrette dressing and couldn't have been happier.  I will be back.
__label__5	Always a great option for lunch.  Home cooked specials every Thursday are always great as well as the Chicken Velvet soup.  The food is great, the prices are right and the service is on a level of its own.  I eat here often and I'm always welcomed and taken care of from the minute I walk in the door.
__label__1	Advertise perfect for those downsizing for selling furniture and house goods.  Maybe so.  But don't expect a call back.  Have been calling over 3 weeks and not a single response!  1 * if they exist.
__label__5	I have been coming to this shop for 10 years. By far the best fade and cleanest lines in SB. Cesar, Ines, Jesse and Ani are all excellent and the energy is ALWAYS positive. Great family business and I can guarantee you won't go anywhere else after you get your hair cut at Mesa Barber Shop.
__label__4	Good food, atmosphere and perfect date destination without the distracting yakety yak!
__label__5	I eat here at least twice a month & always enjoy the food & service. It feels like family. I've had almost everything on the menu that appeals to me so I usually have one of the specials being offered that day. You really need to try it. You'll be glad you did! Shout out to Taurie our server.
__label__5	The food was amazing, the drinks were even better! I cannot express how great the food tasted. I have the pork marinated in adobo and has pickled onions w homemade tortillas. It was amazing, my bf had the sirloin tacos which were also good. I had the margarita de fresa and it tasted perfectly balanced between sweets and strong. The atmosphere is welcoming and the staff is attentive and friendly. I highly recommend.
__label__5	I absolutely love this place! If I could give more stars I would. Before I started going to Budd for my hair, my hair was extremely damaged and very hard to style. After 6 months of seeing Budd my hair had started to really make a change for the better. Today, my hair is so much healthier and the blonde he made me gets me at least a compliment a week. He's extremely entertaining and sociable. All the girls there are friendly and nice to talk to. I leave Renee's feeling like a beauty queen!
__label__5	This is probably my fav restaurant out there. Great food, great service, great managers, great everything! The manager Chip always walks by & says hello, really makes the experience here a lot more personable. Plus their burgers are amazinggg
__label__5	First experience was awesome, Tiffini was so amazing and sweet! She did my toes and dip nails and she did great! Pedicure was $32 and well worth it, nails were $55 with tips and they looked beautiful! Salon was very clean, movies playing, complimentary wine and drinks! Will be going to see her again!
__label__5	Great view, awesome food and drinks. Love the bisque. Our service is always good and all the staff is very friendly.
__label__5	Chris is unbelievable.    I have a new oil change place!    He made suggestions but didn't push.  And for that I am grateful.   Take 5 has a real asset.   Give home a raise immediately.
__label__5	Live band & crawfish boil! Can't ask for more! The people were nice & very hospitable!
__label__1	Stay away! I had the WORST crab cake sandwich that actually made me sick. Service was slow, too.
__label__1	This company took my car without authorization hours after i cancelled the tow with them. Funny story their name is on time towing yet they were over an hour late lol. i will be filing a civil lawsuit against the company in reference to the way they handle business, anyone willing to join me contact me on here.
__label__1	If you stay here, make sure you check in during the day when management is present , because at night, nothing but rude nasty, front desk agents who cop an attitude. So glad the call was recorded on my end as proof.
__label__4	The food was amazing. Definitely try the Mardi Gras omelette!! The customer service was a little poor that's why I only gave this place 4 stars. The waitress spilled water on me and just threw a couple of napkins at me and didn't offer to help. Then a glass broke from our table and no one I mean none of the employees hurried to clean it up. It was broken on the ground for a couple of minutes until I asked the TWO waitresses right next to our table to do something.
__label__5	John is a great guy and super knowledgeable about all things electronic . He did a awesome job of hanging my outdoor tv. Prompt and super neat and his price was also very reasonable . Loves his work and will used and recommend him in the future !! Thank you
__label__5	Hands down an all around amazing staff! Very relaxing & inviting environment. Hair is always on point. They care about the overall health of my hair! 10+ years in my hair and grateful for it!
__label__1	Rudest staff in all downtown! Won't let you in in a plain white T-shirt. Minus the fact I saw multiple people inside with white T-shirts. ‍
__label__5	"One of the best discoveries since I started working in Center City. I've resolved to try a new flavor on each visit - but it is hard when you get hooked on fig, bacio or dulce de leche. 
On a trip to Italy several years ago my friends and I would each get different gelato flavors so we could try them all -- we came so close. I might have to attempt this undertaking alone. 
In short, don't get scared off by an Italian name or an unusual flavor - TRY IT!!"
__label__4	Comfort food galore. Food is rich, heavy, and tasty. I couldn't finish my eggs benny. I had 1/4 and was full and couldn't move. Hash browns are better than other places. I went early in the AM but it got packed fast. Coffees are huge.
__label__5	Growing up in rural Indiana I had no access to Ethiopian food growing up. This was my first exposure to this cuisine and I loved it! We got the combination 1 for lunch. It was plenty of food to split between 2 people. A 3rd could probably join in if you weren't starving like us. The lamb, chicken, and beef dishes were amazing! The lentils and cabbage were also extremely flavorful. The bread was very satisfying with a nice sour tinge on the back taste. Wonderful restaurant. Will be back!
__label__5	"Sushi! This is the only Ruth's Chris in the WORLD with sushi. It was a great surprise to get a unique appetizer here that no other Ruth's can offer.

As for the rest of the meal, it was world class as you would expect from any Ruth's. The ribeye was perfectly marbled and prepared and their new smoky chipotle fingerling potatoes were excellent."
__label__5	DANK. Saved so many from the deep despair of late night hunger. Always get the right food, super tasty, and relatively quick. Never left me disappointed. Def my favorite dominos ever. Too clutch.
__label__1	I show up and the bartender says Buffalo Cauliflower is not on happy hr. Who made this ad?
__label__3	Very clean and friendly staff. Thought the food was ok the fries seemed like McDonald's fries. The eggs Benedict was good but would be better on an English muffin . I did love their fresh orange juice and the blood mary. Will still come back for the atmosphere and try other dishes. I also like that they use the yelp waitlist so we were able to time getting here very well. Kids friendly and they have kid meals. Parking is tight so you would either need valet or park on the street which wasn't a problem for us .
__label__1	Just terribly slow. Like it not just slow, you waste your entire day waiting for them to take your order. Trust me YOU WILL REGRET IT.
__label__1	I will be calling this company to complain on Monday!!! Bought tickets from this site for Disney on Ice in Portland, Oregon. This was the site I was directed to purchase tickets. I must have missed something, I have never bought tickets online and after this will never again. I did not see or know that Center Stage was a third party site. Paid approx $60.00 each ticket for face value $25.00 tickets. Maybe they will be nice when I call but I dought it.
__label__1	Avoid this place. Was passing through Reno and was craving sushi. Some of the nigiri was edible until I had a bite that was so bad I had to spit it into my napkin. It tasted rancid. I'm really hoping I don't get sick. Horrible service as well.
__label__4	"I always get their enchilada dinner and a tall lemonade.
8/10 would smash again.

Tip: do NOT oder the nachos. It's just some cracked taco shells with cheese on them. My mother thought I was trying to punk her when she got her ""nachos"" I ordered for her."
__label__4	This is probably one of my favorite Mexican restaurants downtown because they have good Mole. It is hard to find a place with good mole in SB. Their prices are reasonable too and there's never really a line except maybe late at night when all the clubs/bars close.
__label__3	"Our concierge recommended this place for a late lunch.  We had huge po boys!  My catfish po boy was very flavorful.  The fries that came with it were ""meh"".  We were happy with what we ate, and we were so full for the rest of the day, we didn't have dinner!  We thought that the prices were okay.  One of the less expensive places we ate at in NOLA, but also more casual.  I would definitely pick this place over the food court at the Riverwalk if you're at the convention center."
__label__5	I have been going to Dandelion for about 10 years now and have always had great experiences there. I love the avocado sandwich and can never pass up a pumpkin cookie if they are available. Everything is fresh and delicious. It has a casual atmosphere and friendly service. It's a cute little place and has a lot to offer  vegans and non-vegans alike.
__label__3	Even crowded which will let you think this place is above all expectations, some dishes will not reach the level of chinese cuisine
__label__5	Best muffuletta ever! I've heard people rave about New Orleans muffulettas. Now I'm a believer. Others in our party tried different sandwiches and small meals. Without exception, they all gave a thumbs up.
__label__3	The beignets were better than cafe du Monde but the breakfast food was just so so.  My friend had The jambalaya which was a little bit lacking in flavor.  The omelette I had was pretty good but on the small side. The potatoes that came with it were very dry they called them hashbrowns but they were more like home fries little potato cubes. Not seasoned.
__label__1	"When the manager asked how my crab cakes were and I said they were terrible-burnt on the outside and raw on the inside, I kind of expected that she would either give me a refund, bring out a new order, or at least offer coupons. 

No dice. 

She just said that they have had trouble with the grill and she would have to tell the day manager. 

Look, I know it's fast food. But even there if I get raw food. I expect a refund or Re-make or something. 

Better call the health department."
__label__5	I'm so thankful to have Cerdo close by. Even in the dead of winter, I feel like I can take a mini holiday and enjoy delicious food and lively, kitschy but authentic ambience. Thank you, Cerdo... never change!
__label__2	I ordered 3 soups, duck, wonton and dumpling.  The broth is really bad.  Too salty and has a funny taste.  The noodles have the same weird taste.
__label__4	Nice mediterranean fast food. I love their shawarma and baba ganoush. Reasonably priced.
__label__1	Booked an oil change online, arrived after changing my schedule and leaving work early and was told when I arrived it was cancelled. No prior warnings given. No apologies given whatsoever. Why even have an option to book an appointment slot if staff aren't kept on hand to perform the work? It makes zero sense, and heavily discourages me from ever doing business with NTB again, as I would just expect another waste of my time.
__label__1	Bad service, tacky decor in uncomfortable space. And that wouldn't matter except the coffee was also bad. Le sigh.
__label__4	Still great! Had the 2 taco and fries special ($9). Had the fish taco and chicken verde - all great and filling enough for 9 bucks.
__label__5	Friendly staff, delicious and hot food served promptly. Restaurant and bathrooms very clean and well maintained. Outdoor seating area plentiful and clean as well. Definitely would recommend trying this place out. Will have to return so I can try other items on the menu.
__label__4	This taco joint is great and always packed! While the wait can be long on any given night (such as a tuesday), the taco combos are great. It's a great atmosphere to go with a big group of friends. I love the chicken and fish tacos, there are also solid vegetarian options as well. This is the classier taco place on the Loop.
__label__4	Good food and service... would return. Our waiter was attentive and nice. Prices are about $15 a plate.
__label__5	Great full service, awesome communication, crazy fair prices.  This legit small shop run by honest hard working people is exactly what tucson needed.   Keep Rollin Pima Bikes!!!!!!!
__label__3	The food at this particular Quiznos is like the food at any Quiznos: okay, not wonderful, but they make a decent sandwich. During the semester there can be quite a line during lunch time, but otherwise it isn't usually crowded. The two owners of this franchise (husband and wife, I believe) are very friendly and they remember the people they see often, which is nice. The rest of the employees are friendly usually, which makes for a relatively pleasant sandwich experience.
__label__5	Ate here for dinner last night. Place was packed so sat at the bar- the bartender was friendly and helpful with suggestions. I ordered the shrimp and crabcake alfredo- it was excellent and service was prompt. Would go back if in town again.
__label__5	We are so grateful to Rob and Andrea for stepping up during this challenging time! They have created such a nurturing space for essential workers children and our daughter feels very comfortable and happy with them. They are both very good with communications and strive to mental and physically engage the kids! Thank you so much!!
__label__4	I enjoyed my eggs benedict with smoked salmon and their oysters. I will have to stop by during dinner hours to try their mussels. This place makes for a chill brunch spot.
__label__5	Santa Barbara has a wonderful and  diverse coffee culture.  Good Cup is one of the best - great service and excellent state street location
__label__4	Very good food, although a little different than a normal bar. We have eaten here a few times and would definitely eat here again. Highly recommended.
__label__1	I needed a oil change and the manager told me they was closed when the shop wasn't closed . He stated that he was closed after i stated i need a oil change
__label__5	Never heard of sopes before and glad I tried both carnitas and rib eye! To die for.......!!!
__label__2	Sushi isn't fresh. The high ratings are more for the low prices than for the quality of the sushi. If you've had good sushi before, I suggest that you steer clear from this place. This isn't authentic sushi at all. The fish was mushy and rice was under-vinegared and of poor quality. I suppose Philly doesn't have decent sushi options.
__label__5	"I don't leave many reviews usually, but I am in complete awe today and I just had to let the world
Know how amazing this store is. The staff goes above and beyond for my family and I. They make us feel so comfortable and we know they won't let us down. We have fixed our iPads here and phones and they always return to us perfectly! Like they were never even broken or ruined .. honestly when you have the chance definitely check them out and any broken phones or iPads they'll fix for you for an awesome deal! Not like those kiosks at the malls!"
__label__2	"Was not impressed by this place. First of all the service was poor. Waited 20 minutes just to order a drink, then another to receive said drink. I was with a group of friends and the collective feedback was the following: 

-The fish tacos were flavorless
-The blackened chicken in the blackened chicken quesadilla was ""lunch meat chicken"" and not blackened at all.
-The philly cheese steak was over cooked and dry and came without onions despite ordering them.

So overall, it was meh.

The beer was cheap so that was good."
__label__2	Lower quality then Mcdonald's standards.  Dirty, sticky, poor service.  Its always a creepy experience shopping here.
__label__1	Worst service ever. Not enough staff food was good well the items that came out which were ordered correctly and of course they were not. Took 30 minutes waiting on checks that were incorrect. Management didn't jump in to help and seemed lost and a little rude himself. If a downtown restaurant can't handle a crowd especially when a reservation was made and they knee we were coming then they should not be in the downtown area!
__label__3	I had a pretty good Greek Quiche in the dining room. I like that they have a diverse selection of vegetables and deli meats. Dining room wasn't super clean though.
__label__3	Good food usually. A couple of times I've been when they are busy and my noodles came out way overdone.
__label__5	This is exactly what I was hoping would open up in my neighborhood! Service is fast, and the food is healthy in the best possible way - super delicious and you feel happy and full afterward (not deprived). There's something for vegans and meat lovers alike, and it's a very gluten-free friendly restaurant. Plus, there's free soft serve ice cream (vegan, nut-milk based), it's open for all 3 meals, and they have yummy cocktails.
__label__5	Visited the other night for restaurant week and had a great experience!! Their samosa chaat is a must try, as well as their Mumbai mule. The starters, entrées, and desserts were all great. Service was incredible--staff was extremely polite, friendly, and helpful. The restaurant itself is very welcoming and intimate. Will be going here again soon!
__label__5	We have use CAD since we moved to Reno for the last three years twice a year. They always have excellent customer service, friendly and quality work. Look forward to using them for years to come!
__label__5	Family owned business. Great cheese steaks, pizza. Will bend over backwards to satisfy their customers.
__label__4	First visit, group of four for dinner.  Service was excellent, very attentive, never waited for anything.   Three of the four meals were excellent, Lobster Mac n Cheese lacked much flavor.   Would definitely return.
__label__4	"I really did enjoy visiting this airport.  I especially love the cozy, local touches.  There are musical items and decorations placed throughout the airport, along with a place to enjoy live music in comfortable, puffy chairs.

I don't know how seemingly large this place was, but it met my needs.

I didn't like the fact that one has to pay for wi-fi.  I mean, really, in this day and age...Seems like Nashville may still have some growing to do."
__label__3	I'm giving the three stars due to atmosphere and service. Service was awesome. The hummus and pita bread were delicious! The stuffed eggplant was not at all my thing. It had a funky taste. It's in a cool, hipster neighborhood, and looks great all around. I wouldn't care for the food again though.
__label__5	"Eat here easily twice a week. Incredible fried chicken but also tons of other great options. Everything is quick to order with a friendly staff all at very reasonable price! Highly recommend.

Also PS, the cheddar biscuits are on my mind about once a day..."
__label__3	So, this is like the Qdoba, but bibimbop instead of burritos. Service was fast, but staff didn't seem very friendly. They had some options I'm not used to seeing on bibimbop, which is cool, but they lacked a few I really enjoy but that isn't too big a deal. The price was a little more than I would like for what I got.  Overall I was left feeling kinda meh about the place. Personally I'll go to Omani in Carmel the next time I have a bibimbop craving.
__label__1	This Pharmacy is SO SLOW. Every time. The drive thru should be quick and it takes forever! It shouldn't take me 10 minutes to drop off a prescription. And they don't guarantee that they will have my medication. One time they gave me the wrong medication, I had to bring it back and some were taken and it was a huge ordeal. I was at Walgreens across the street and I'm going back. I can't deal with this anymore.
__label__2	Sat for 15 minutes before having to flag a waitress down for service. Ordered everything - food did come out quickly per our request, but no silverware. Asked for twice. Also asked for salt and pepper - took longer then it should. Food was very greasy- even for fried food. Charged us double for an item - had to get check fixed. Manager did come and apologized and did take the item off the check. Overall poor service and food wasn't that good either. Staff was friendly- just didn't know what they're doing.  Won't be returning.
__label__5	We just bought a bike here today and this young man was so very helpful! He went out of his way to make sure that I got exactly what I wanted in my new bike! Thank you!!!!
__label__4	On any given Saturday, a conglomerate of food trucks congregate at Centennial park. One particular truck, Smoke et al. caught my eye. They serve smoked meats and the like. I ordered the traditional pork sammie which included coleslaw and a vinegar-based white sauce on the side. The co-diners selected a Verde taco with pork (huge and looked fantastic) and pork sliders on homemade biscuits. Overall the reviews were favorable. And there was plenty of food for the $20 we spent for two. It was certainly one of the more popular trucks in the park.
__label__5	This is the best place for crossfit. Very friendly and helpful staff and members. Fairly priced. Availability for classes is great. Learn a lot and will get in shape quick. This place will do great business in the future.
__label__5	Best prices on mattresses around and magnificent service. Just bought a new mattress and boxspring for my son at a great price and then got 5 gel memory foam pillows for only $10 each. I would highly recommend this place. I'll never go anywhere else. The salesman, Glenn, was extremely helpful and knowledgeable.
__label__5	We LOVE Dr Scott Philips!  My children have seen him since tiny little babies, and he is great with kids.  He knows just how to talk to them and explain the procedures in a language they understand.
__label__5	Hubby wanted a burger and I wanted something different.  The Duke has a large menu with all kinds of different choices for everyone.  The fried mac n cheese bites were amazing! I enjoyed the buffalo tots and my husband loved the Duke burger.
__label__4	I don't shop here. This is strictly about the coffee which I think is fantastic. It's nice to give Starbucks a little competition. I've had the café au lait and lattes and they are great. Never burned or too weak.
__label__1	"Poor amount and quality of food. Chicken had very little taste and the leg and thigh are the actual size of a pigeon. Makes you wonder. 
Dining room closes at 2pm now. 
I do not recommend this place."
__label__5	I like this place a lot, it's cozy, great selection of brews, finger food also decent. There is so many choices of craft beers. The manager and his staffs are so friendly. Love them so much. This place is great if you can't make it to Nashville!
__label__3	Went for a wedding this past weekend. Checked into our room got changed and stepped on a piece of glass. Grabbed shoes and realized there was glass along two walls of the room in tiny pieces all over the carpet and outside the door. Our comforter was dirty had to call housekeeping to come vaccume and bring a clean comforter. Won't be going back anytime soon.
__label__5	Insane food. So flavorful and well-prepared. The service was incredible. We ordered an abundance of food so we could bring some home to Kentucky with us. We had the chicken chili (extra spicy), chicken jalfrezi, and chicken 65. All of these dishes were yummy. The chicken 65 was my favorite. They packaged the leftovers in sealable plastic containers to make it easily transportable. We will definitely go here again.
__label__4	Don't let the exterior fool you. This place is a legit taqueria with BANGING tamales! We tried the chips and salsa, pork tamale, tacos dorado, carnitas taco, shrimp fajitas and tres leches cake. Everything was super flavorful and the service was excellent. This is the real deal Mexican food you want.
__label__5	Ordering To-Go and the friendliness of the staff and their knowledge of the menu was so impressive. So happy about this choice tonight. Valerie should get kudos for being so knowledgable about the menu, and so helpful with her suggestions.
__label__5	This restaurant never disappoints! What a treat to eat here on Christmas Eve. The pompano is delicious!
__label__5	"Man, what a fun night! I cannot believe I had never been here before. 

The atmosphere is great, the bartender was insanely nice and welcoming, he even helped my friend find a suitable beer for her annoying dietary needs. There are travel-sized Connect 4 games on the bar! I could play that all night. 

The comedy theater is small, but really the perfect size. The comics were great and interacted with the audience. It was an all-around fantastic night and I have already told several of my friends about this place. I can't wait to go back!"
__label__5	Open Sunday, big plus! Staff very friendly and accommodating. Nice relaxed atmosphere. Not over priced. Would highly recommend
__label__1	I don't even believe they should get one star. First off the waitress Lina couldn't even explain what something on the menu was. We order our ice cream and it took almost 20 minutes and our waitress left us before we even got it. Don't get me wrong, the food was great. I wouldn't recommend this place if you have a short temper.
__label__5	"2018-02-28


I just enjoyed lunch with my wonderful wife... when we realized this morning that we could have a lunch date today we quickly picked Canyon Cafe.

Awesome as always!

My wife enjoyed the salmon salad and I enjoyed the triple tacos:
- Pork and pineapple and limes and more
- Bison
- Fish

And we enjoyed the ""consistently favorites: 
- the awesome chips
 and salsa when we sat down
- and the white chocolate wrapped in the banana leaf, with the check.

This was what we needed - food-wise, and couple-wise.

Thank you, Canyon Cafe!"
__label__4	This is a solid hotel, with a well stocked spacious fitness center, pool and hot tub, hot breakfast options at a restaurant, spacious rooms with microwave and mini fridge, and great customer service. The only real downsides, are that the walls are quite thin and a lot of the things in my room looked quiet worn and abused. I can't quite decide if that is the hotel's fault or the customer's fault. It's close to the airport, there's a gas station nearby, and it's close to the freeway. I'll certainly come back in the future.
__label__1	Very unprofessional, sloppy and not very nice. Discovered that their was an extra charge on my card. They tried to change me for gas... I did fill it back up. Make sure to check your card after.... They might try to rip you off....
__label__5	"Although I'm not a kid, but the height of one, nor do I have any kids I still have been here several times for parties. This is truly a cool space. I love the exhibits for kids to learn while having a little fun. Its also great facility  for grown up to be kid again.

The grocery store is the best! brings out the inner bagger in me."
__label__1	"The service was horrible. The food looked and tasted like it was microwaved and a cockroach was beside our table. When we told the manager he was rude and said ""it is just that time of year for cockroaches to be out"". Gross."
__label__1	"I must be an idiot but we tried Rose Tree restaurant ....again.... BAD IDEA... AGAIN!
I think it has actually gotten worse, totally did not think it could get worse. Everything came out cold, then when they brought our entrees, everything was over cooked. Just bad."
__label__4	Great shop, with a nice selection for less than fifteen dollars per bottle.  You can sample any bottle by the glass for a small fee.  Recently opened and plenty of space to add to the options available.  Friendly proprietor.  Worth the stop.
__label__3	It's okay, we went on a busy Saturday night and while the place was busy it wasn't packed solid.  The food was bland, and my dish was dry as a bone (not even a sauce to help things).  The only saving grace was the beer.  I would give it another try next year when we come back but only if we run out of other places to go.
__label__4	This is the best chorizo breakfast burrito I have ever had. Tortillas are made right there daily. Can't wait to try everything else. My only complaint was no ready coffee and she didn't seem inclined to make any
__label__5	Our waitress was amazing, food was fire, service was quick. We went to go race and didn't make reservations so we had to wait a bit. Went to grab food for our group and was not disappointed. Will definitely go back just to visit when not racing.
__label__5	Amazing coffee and eclectic ambiance. The waitresses are kind, and the atmosphere is laid back. The German Chocolate Mocha is divine. Perfect place to study or chat. Such a gem!!
__label__5	With today's technology evolving so quickly, it's hard to go into a store and decide what to buy and how to know if it is a good product or not. My experience in this store with Haseeb was wonderful. He listened to my needs and didn't shove his opinion down my throat. He was well aware of where everything is in the store was and recommended based off of his knowledge and facts. He is very customer service oriented and is a huge asset to P.C. Richard & Son. I will be going back for my future purchases for sure!
__label__1	I made an appointment for 1pm to take my drivers test, and they made me wait a whole HOUR more. Even after I had made an appointment. And on top of that, my instructor was just rude and marked me wrong for something that was entirely safe. I wish I could give them a 0 honestly.
__label__1	Went to pickup food for doordash. When I asked to order food for myself while waiting, the manager told me I'm not allowed to order while picking up food. He said it was part of doordash' policy. After contacting doordash to inquiry about this so called policy, they confirmed there was no such policy in place. The manager turned away a paying customer just for their time management. Horrible customer service. I will no longer be coming here and warn everyone to stay away. Absolute trash.
__label__4	Great food. Not so great with the customer service. My daughter and I enjoy the food. Very tasty and conveniently located nearby.
__label__2	My order was messed up, when I called to advise, the girl who answered, giggled and said to come back and she would fix it. I ordered oxtails with Mac and cheese and sweet plantain. The oxtails were good but very little in size and portion. Sweet plantains were not sweet and Mac and cheese had no taste.
__label__4	"We just moved to Nevada and we were fortunate to select Arario for lunch. My beef Bibinbop was delicious. The only improve that I could suggest is the the pot is hotter so that the rice continues to crisp at the table. The pork Bulgogi was also very tasty. 

The service was excellent. We look forward to returning soon."
__label__5	"Amazing breakfast. Great wait staff. We tried the cowboy omelette, the French toast, and the  corned beef hash. They were all yummy!!

I would highly recommend this establishment."
__label__1	No regard for customers. My husband showed up for his appointment, we received confirmation texts, he took the day off work for his procedure - and they were CLOSED. No one bothered to call us and let us know. This is the second time they've been inconsiderate about this same appointment.
__label__5	This is by far one of my favorite coffee shops in town. I often go to the Campbell location but this one is more open and has a lot more natural light. The space is bigger in general and has great decor. The coffee is great as usual!
__label__3	"Luckily this place closes at 2am so I was able to meet up with a friend after work to catch up.

We had the Memphis pork sandwich with beer battered fries. 
The memphis pork sandwich was so juicy and good.
We liked the fries so much that another portion of fries was ordered. 
Queso this time.

But the service, I dunno, this is where the stars get decreased. Where was our server?
And to get a fork or any attention was quite the hassle.

Food was great but there is room for improvement with the service."
__label__4	I was torn between 3 stars and 4.Sort of a good Goofy bad Goofy dilemma.So the two Goofys agreed on the 4 stars.The burgers are really good;but not necessarily the best in town.The fries on the otherhand are hands down the best, period.I could only handle a single had to save room for the fries.And the coolest thing about it is this place is it's so not a chain.The ambience might be a little tacky,some may even say dive-y but that just adds to the charm.
__label__3	The atmosphere is certainly day of the dead inside but nice. The salsa and margaritas were above average. The food is average for Mexican fare in St. Louis but I thought my enchiladas could have better. The chicken inside were chunks and tough to cut. Good service.
__label__3	The server we had was sweet and attentive to our table she was knowledgeable about the beer they had on tap. The decor is nice and inviting, the round table for shorter people is a little hard to sit around. The beer we had was pretty tasty I ordered one from Arizona it was an IPA and we ordered and Ale from Colorado. But we all ordered pizza and it was overly salted to the point where our mouths are hurting.
__label__1	If I could give zero stars, I would. The service is absolutely horrible. I waited over 30 minutes for my food. Unless you are looking to wait a while for your food, I would not recommend.
__label__2	Really dark, seats uncomfortable, sometimes staff not very attentive. I was going back for the rolls though, until tonight. 2 times in a roll I got the wrong order and had to wait a long time. I might try one more time because it's close to my house...
__label__4	I saw the two negative reviews so I wanted to give my (favorable) impression. I had a stereo system  put in my 1966 mustang keeping the original looking faceplate. They had ordered the wrong kick plate speaker but otherwise the process was flawless. I'm  still waiting for the kick plate to be painted to match the car. Even without those speakers the system sounds great. I would recommend dicks highly.
__label__5	Quick and easy. You just sit in your car while they do the work for you. Had trouble processing my American Express card, said transaction declined, so I switched to a Visa card and worked.
__label__1	"DO NOT GO HERE! I walked in one day to get a pedicure. It wasn't busy at all. I was maybe 5min. Into my pedicare and a ""usual"" customer came in and I was asked if the nail technician could service her and then come back to me. I just left after that."
__label__5	WOW! Absolutely Delicious! This is the Most Authentic Italian Cuisine I have Ever had. The Spaghetti Sauce was Loaded with Love!
__label__4	"popped in for a casual dinner and enjoyed every bit of it!  we didn't have any issues with their service, and they accept credit cards!  a few dishes that we loved:
- meatballs
- shrimp pil pil (LOVE!!)
- grilled vegetables
- grilled lamb
- greek wine (white)

will definitely go back again!"
__label__5	I got the Panang curry with chicken and it was amazing! Everything was so fresh. It was just the right amount of spicy for me. Portions are large, at least for me, I had leftovers. We dined in and I was pleased by how clean everything is. The ladies there treat you like family. They were so nice and attentive. I went there with my bf who goes there at least once a week and I can see why. I look forward to going there many more times!
__label__1	"Have dined many times at many Ruth's Chris throughout the years. I wish my local St. Pete location would allow me to make a reservation on the patio. Was shocked to learn that they were unable to reserve a table for 11, claiming it was ""first come, first serve"". Oh well, I guess business is so robust they don't need us..."
__label__4	I was very pleased with the service we received. The service call was responded to very quickly. The service person was very polite and efficient. The only negative we have is expense. We thought the service was very expensive for the short of amount of time and the ease of the repair.
__label__5	Of all the Mexican food restaurants in Tucson and believe me you can't swing a dead gringo without hitting one or two. Little Mexico sits near the top of the heap. We have been ending up here for years (over 25) and the meals are always fresh  and the servings are plentiful. The wait staff is top notch too.
__label__4	Pierogi bliss. This place is my lunch treat at work.  The only reason it's not 5 stars is because you never know what pierogies they'll have.  Some type of website with up-to-date pierogi selections might be great.
__label__5	Beauty property, clean room, gorgeous elevator, and the young lady who was running the little coffee cafe this morning (2/9) was so friendly, helpful, and outgoing. Great experience!
__label__4	Such a variety in baked goods. Dont be afraid to try something out of the ordinary, you can taste the freshness in the food. i got the chicken biscket sandwich it was good, but did lack a bit of flavor, the coffee is to die for.
__label__5	I usually deal with Kevin. Their service is great and I've even referred several of my friends and clients in Tampa Bay to them. They always do a great job and make me look good. Thank you!
__label__1	Just ate here. This has to be some of the worst service I've ever had. I work in a restaurant and I know what the standard is and I can say with confidence this is QUITE below standard. The best part about our visit was getting our checks and leaving. Our first impression from the host was that she couldn't hardly be bothered. We waited on our food for over 50 minutes. All our food came out cold. Probably could've gotten better food service at a hardware store. Thanks for nothing. If there was a 0 star option I'd use that instead.
__label__1	This place is awful! Made us feel unwanted and insecure for being ourselves. Don't go here! SAD!
__label__5	Excellent customer service!!  The office staff with their questions before and their follow up after and the cleaning technicians were amazing!  The entire experience from start to finish was great!  They were on time, extremely courteous and most importantly did a great job!  I would highly recommend this company.  I had both the furnace and carpet cleaning services done before I moved into my new home.
__label__3	For the prices they charge here you'd expect the best tacos and food ever but it's disappointing. Drinks are fun and the environment is great but the food did not meet expectations for such an upscale priced restaurant. Would recommend for happy hour, but not so much for a dinner.
__label__5	Very good!! The appetizers were incredible! get the tulip dumplings. Also my waiter was a delight!
__label__5	seems very clean and organized. i usually go to east location but was closer to this one. I buy my dog food here. service is always excellent
__label__5	Convenient parking, fun shopping and a lot of good Asian stuff. I personally like Oregon market better but this one is good too.
__label__1	Well I am not longer coming to this location! I waited 15 minutes for a flipping egg McMuffin!! When I said something to the 16yr old looking manager he just laughed! The last time they gave use  raw burgers and they thought that was funny too! I emailed the address on the receipt and they never contacted me back. Also when I stopped and bought chicken nuggets they were  cold. Save yourself some aggravation and don't stop at this location!
__label__5	Cannot wait for another night out at this fantastic spot!  Our server Alissa was the most genuine surprise of the night!  Thank you for the great input . Fantastic old fashion and great glass of wine, calimari and extras for the appetizer, puttanesca was fabulous! will return
__label__1	Our entrees never came out of the kitchen before we had to leave to get to the airport.  Was absolutely ridiculous that after 90 minutes we did not have an entree served to us.
__label__5	Me and my lady went Saturday because we were craving sushi. Had to get on Yelp and found Sushi Thai. The pictures of the food and insider the establishment were very clean and food looked amazing. We gave it a shit and were highly pleased. We got the Walk Me Roll. A order of Combination Fried Rice and a medium Chicken Pad See Ew. Everything was freshly cooked and great taste. Food was so good l, we started eating and forgot to take pictures. We will definitely be back. Customer service was top notch.
__label__4	"I have to laugh at the previous post about Sunset being a Trump bar! Actually most people we meet in that area are Trump supporters! YAY. MAGA
Fun place to hang out!"
__label__5	Never had bad service. Great food, great beer!! They have such a big selection for ciders and I love that!!
__label__5	Fabian is by far an artist! He can make any women feel super sexy leaving his salon! I know I do! Can't wait to get back in his seat  love you Fabian
__label__3	I don't recommend buying cupcakes without ordering them fresh. The cupcakes they sell Individually have been sitting out and they're really dry and the frosting is hard. Not enjoyable. Good taste but I'm sure they would have been better fresh.
__label__5	This is a classic small town cafe. We did lunch. Pot roast and a burger. Everything was hot and tasty! Food came out quickly. The service was very friendly. The sides were excellent. The green beans were well seasoned and obviously cooked long and slow as they should be. The baked apples were perfect. Not overly sweet. They too were not from a can or a heat and serve packet. The burger was large and fries fresh. I would definitely come again and I live in Nashville. I was just driving by, but I'll drive back for a crack at some of that fudge pie!
__label__2	Last 3 times the pizza crust was burnt and so crispy you could not cut it or bite into it. Waited a long time for bad pizza.
__label__5	What an amazing theater operation!  Buy tickets, donate, support it--let's all pull together and preserve this true community treasure.  And whatever you do, don't miss the first feature in the restored Art Deco era main theatre. Wow--a knockout!
__label__4	"Went to the ""Fake Wake"" they had right before Halloween. Fun space, interesting décor, but small. I could see this filling up fast. We did not eat, but our cocktails were lovely and it was a great atmosphere. The show itself was a lot  of fun and the actors were great to talk to. Definitely will go back to see what else they have to offer."
__label__4	Now we are talking pizza at My Pie. What a great place. Clean, fast and delicious. Also very nice employees. My Pie your a hit with us.
__label__1	Overpriced, waiter we had on night I was there was apathetic towards serving at best. Food was ok, but not worth the trouble. This place makes The Olive Garden look like Shangri-La.
__label__1	Don't let the guys that work there talk you into the car wash coupon its a scam.  they have been charging my bank account unauthorized for 2 months and I can't get them to stop taking my money.  Tried calling the number for this business, goes to a answer machine in phoenix. No return call, no resolution.  Not good.
__label__4	Solid food, good sides and good service.  Soondubu and LA kalbi and kalbitang entrees were all pretty good compared to general nj standards... can't go wrong with usual korean fare here.
__label__5	If I could give this establishment a 10 I would. The food was superb , and service was very personable. Highly recommended
__label__1	Very disappointed. Called in advance, told they weren't busy. Walked over in 2 minutes. 45 minute wait. All of a sudden? And the noise. The food was okay but not worth the aggravation.
__label__4	Good food, nice place, great service, everything you could ask you in a burger chain.:)
__label__4	Great prices and authentic food!  The tableside salsa is the way to go and you can make it just the way you want it.  I love the seafood dishes here!
__label__5	I've had 2 laser hair removal treatments, and so far I am extremely satisfied.   The electrologist is phenomenonal.  I haven't had any side effects.  I've had treatment done by another business and I wish I would have came here first.
__label__4	"Beautiful place! We were staying at the hotel in front and went there for breakfast. We got lattes and a black tea. The lattes were served in a weird glass; though for other coffees they use a regular cup. 
They serve ILLY coffee which is always a plus
Prices were of for coffee. 4$-5$ each
I also had the crepe with butter which was quite good."
__label__5	New in town from the Copper state. 1st night here and tried the dairy ice cream pretty darn good. A pint is only $4.77.. First time ever trying black licorice ice cream.... Trey was great as cashier and all around happy face. They are still giving samples so go try a few flavors and say howdy to TREY.
__label__5	"Welcome to New Orleans!

My first meal off the planet and first experience to NOLA was AWESOME.  Ok ,maybe just cuz it was my first time ,i still can't think of anything bad.  
Love the boudin sandwich, and love the grilled oysters.  Big fan of the special po boy half shrimp half oysters!  Sat at the bar, and the bartender was nothing but helpful . 

Definitely going back!"
__label__5	"Triton is the best! Their house beers are great. Railsplitter IPA is one of my favorites, and a go-to wherever I am

Their taproom is awesome, too. Near ft Ben, often have food trucks, and a cool outdoor seating area, too!"
__label__3	Hygenist and Dr very professional and very short wait when on time. The front office person seems flakey.
__label__3	"The new Enjoy Centre is alright..it is technically a really nice place..looks great and there is lots to see and do....but it has certainly lost alot of the original atmosphere that Hole's always had. Which is a real shame..

Also one thing that kinda earked me was how expensive the cafe was..and it was self server (aka, you had to clear your own tables etc..) but for the high price you pay, you'd expect they should."
__label__5	The ticket clinic is the best. The winning team! They won two cases for my dad for me thank you thank you thank you highly appreciated
__label__2	usually don't do this but I feel two poor experiences it's necessary. Black beans tasted like chemicals, the restaurant had a funny smell to it, and my gf felt the same way. Although beef tacos were good as well as yellow rice.
__label__3	I went back here a few weeks ago, had have decided this place is just OK.  We got a porterhouse to share and at least 1/4 of it was so chewy and grissley we couldn't eat it.  The bartender was also kind of annoying. When we told him we didn't want another drink, he gave us a strange look like we were bad people.  I probably won't be back. There are way too many other places that have better service and better food
__label__3	The Bada bing shrimp salad would be so much better if the chef knew how to pickle the cucumber and carrot. The pickled vegetables were detrimental to the salad, it would be delicious otherwise. Please Julienne the cucumber and carrot and ferment in a sweet and sour pungent brine..
__label__2	I called Courtney's restaurant yesterday to confirm that they had chicken and dressing that evening. What they actually served on Tuesday evening was chicken in gravy so when I got there I could not have chicken and dressing because of my allergy to gravy. In my frustration I had to settle for meatloaf which was not bad. I also bought the meal for my wife my son and his wife my other son and his girlfriend and a step-granddaughter. The restaurant was cold I guess in retrospect our next meal will probably be at a different restaurant.
__label__1	Worst customer service ever. Some of these guys don't deserve the job. They're rude to everyone. You should go somewhere else because none of these guys care about their job and what it means to DO YOUR JOB. Have some honor and respect for yourself to do your job right. They should be ashamed of themselves.
__label__3	My family went here and we overall liked the food. Some of It seemed overpriced for what it was, like the crab bisque and desserts. We were never served any water until halfway the appetizers came and we had to ask for water and again for a refill. My father ordered the market fish which he loved, but the side of potatoes that came with it didnt come till after he was done eating and they were extremely oily. The steak and fish were great and the place is nice, just needs some revamping.
__label__5	"BEEFSTEW!! - CASH ONLY $$$

UGH. How can something be this good.. even in a hot summer day you can eat this. The flavor is like no other. I have tried many places in California, Atlanta, and even in New York! This place is by far the best. The carrots, beef chunks and the broth ... so good! I cant explain it but you must go and try it. They also have Japanese dishes there and other Vietnamese dishes."
__label__1	"Not impressed at all. Meat was burned and tasteless, also not much on the wraps on the meat department- service super slow- for the same price you get a much better meal at Mediterra in Goleta.

Also, really irritated that they left the kebab stick on the chicken and then placed the whole thing inside the wrap... eeek!"
__label__2	Old rooms, smoky casinos...jacked up prices over holidays. Disappointing. Showed up at midnight on a holiday weekend and waited over an hour to check in. No thanks.
__label__5	Probably the best biscuit and hot chicken we had on our trip! I highly recommend the dirty princess- biscuit, hot chicken, sausage gravy, cheddar cheese SO YUM! The bonuts were ok but the the chicken biscuit was divine
__label__4	Great juice! Friendly staff!! Was a little crowded but lines went fast. I tried the coconut yogurt was yummy.
__label__1	I ordered three drinks. They were all made wrong the first time. The second time two were made wrong. The third time, they were still made wrong and I gave up trying.
__label__1	I think the staff here is retarded. Long story short I got my 4 for 4 with no drink nor fries.
__label__2	This food truck is at the Chillzone event in Tampa. The short cook is working his ass off because it's busy and all but tell me why is he wiping his nose as he's preparing the food. Yeah he has on gloves but DAMN!!! change them at least...This must be their special sauce #NoExtraCharge
__label__3	"It's your standard Ikea, but just messier and not as well kept as the other Ikeas that I've been to...could be because it's in the city.

Self check out lines are convenient. 

Parking - huge lot"
__label__4	"Pretty good     The waiter did that thing where he does not right down your order. Which is pretty cool if he gets the order right.    But he had to come back 2 times to ""clarify"" the order then sent someone else back a third time because the bottom of the order was ""torn off"". 

Lame!

The food was good but the waiter got it wrong.  One of us was served the wrong antipasti and another received the wrong entrée.  So much for the memory game.     Offer him a pencil and paper if he is not writing it down."
__label__4	"Our first time, good experience overall, the counter guy was friendly and helpful, the setting is walk up help yourself seating type but the  menu was well represented and priced right.  Then the quality of the food exceeded our expectations and we will be back.  My food was fresh, salad was well cut and fresh, veggies cooked just right and pasta was deliciously made and the sauce was tasty.  My wife's chicken was not dry and she was pleased overall (and shes picky).

So we will be back and look forward to choosing something else from the large menu, definitely a good value."
__label__5	"Extensive menu, something for everyone. 

I tried Chipotle recently and didn't understand what the fuss was about. This place blows Chipotle out of the water. I had a bean and cheese burrito, but I really wanted to try some of the other stuff they had. I think I'm going to be coming here again soon for lunch.

Best part is, they're one store away from Yapple Yogurt, which is a great place to stop for dessert."
__label__1	"I ordered takeout.  Three tasteless dishes and lousy rice.
The sauces tasted like it was right from a can."
__label__5	"Casual bistro that is all about the food.
The lamb chops - great portion size, cooked medium rare with great accompaniments.
My wife had the shrimp pappardelle pasta - the best I've pasta I've had in any restaurant anywhere.  Superb.
Went right to the top of my list of places to go in Nashville if I'm looking to spend a few bucks.  PHB offers tremendous value for a restaurant at this price point.  
I left impressed and look forward to returning."
__label__5	The food was perfect!! It was smoked to perfection and the sauce was a great addition to the ribs and chicken that didn't even need any sauce in my opinion. The service was friendly and welcoming. And the homemade lemonade was a nice touch. Definitely would come back again.
__label__1	"This business constantly is spamming our company email. It always start "" we don't want to bother you but"" . It's quite annoying considering we have never heard of this place nor need it. We have never contacted them. Maybe they will get a clue eventually as per Reed B."
__label__1	Poor/slow service. Sat me down at a dirty table. Didn't have any roast beef left, i.e. the item I wanted to order. I just ended up getting up and going to a the seemingly only other restaurant on the front end of security.
__label__5	For the area, I would say its the best around. The staff is nice, and they are very attentive. Its a nice place to go out with someone and a perfect date atmosphere. They may lack in selection, but it's probably because there aren't many people that go out for sushi, therefore they many not stock a bunch of fresh fish. Honestly I thought it was very good
__label__5	"Salsa verde enchiladas were amazing. Ask them to go light on the green salsa. They were ultra-fresh, and tasted, well, over-the-top awesome.

Chips and salsa were also fantastic. They have an amazing selection of salsas. if you like your salsa blazing hot they have plenty of choices. But the mild and medium salsa was also very good."
__label__4	Very nice. Would come back. Great service. Food was very good.  One of the better Itlaian restaurants in Reno....and there really aren't that many.
__label__5	Parker's is a great example of how a business can pivot during the pandemic. They thoughtfully worked out all their processes and it's a pleasure to shop there. Great selection and friendly service.
__label__3	This was a random choice and was ok.  If you want New York style pizza it's a great value.  I ordered Stromboli and it was more like a calzone and all my meat and veggies were in one section.  Not sure I would go back unless I wanted New York pizza while in town.
__label__5	This place was awesome, and accommodating, a BYO that provides a wide variety of great tasting foods at ridiculously bargain prices for Philadelphia.  You can't find grilled squid anywhere for 12 dollars, let alone grilled squid that tastes good.  If you like seafood mixed with some Mediterranean flares, give this place a shot
__label__4	This is a super great place to hangout and catch up with friends! The nacho fries was amazing! The plate was huge and such a great price for it as well! The fajitas were a tad bit salty for me but the side of beans, pico de Gallo, rice, and guacamole wrapped in the flour tortillas balanced it out really well! I definitely will come back to try more stuff from the menu! The portions are great enough to share with another person! I also had their al pastor tacos, that was pretty packed on as well and it was good!
__label__5	Great gem in Summerfield. This little sushi place is on big bend and summerfield dr behind the Exxon. Dani and his crew make amazing sushi concoctions and they have other great cooked dishes too. They don't skimp on fish or creativity either. The place is small but cozy too.
__label__5	Just moved here and up the road I found two bucks saloon. Was greeted by traci who was so nice and made me feel at home. Such good service and had a chance to get some of the food here and it was outstanding ! Will definetly be frequenting here often !!!!
__label__3	"God, I hate/love this place.  Hit and miss coffee, snotty baristas, slow service and indifferent food but a huge, cosy-looking space to work in and open until 10 PM.  

I think they train them not to smile and to eat food with one hand while they make coffee with the other, but that could be because I tend to come in during the evening when it's quiet."
__label__4	Nice green tea pedicure.  Pricey.  I won't come here regularly,  but it was a nice treat.  Sweet technician.  Check out my tip for info about the 10% off issue.  Very clean and nicely decorated.  Open on sunday, which is a huge plus.
__label__5	Brian Rogers is a great guy and he always does an amazing job helping his customers.   I drive 22 miles to get my medications from his pharmacy.  Darn good pricing too!
__label__4	Great pizza with amazing sauce! Gluten free pasta is available, with lots of options for appies!
__label__4	The meal was delicious as always. The menu has changed drastically and now our date night has doubled in cost!
__label__4	"Great cheap breakfast place.
Blueberry pancakes are a must.
Sourdough toast was fresh."
__label__5	AMAZING!!! Fresh, Fresh..... Fresh. The spinach salad was wonderful, the crab, avocado toast was WOW and the  short rib raviolis,  well just count your blessings that you heard about this from me to try!!! That should not be a secret. We will be back.
__label__5	We could not have chosen a better place for our one year anniversary. From the food, to the service, to the beautiful green setting and atmosphere, this place was perfect. We felt so celebrated by the staff!
__label__5	I have been coming to Mexican Mariachi Grill for some time now, both to their old and new location (after their short move). The food has always been excellent, and reasonably priced for portion sizes. I typically get their chicken burrito and black bean soup, and am always satisfied.
__label__5	"So nice to meet you Noodles!  This is the best ramen ever for my soul.  I felt instant gratification after and as I'm heading home or running errands afterward, I felt so happy to have found this awesome place.  

This MUST be my first time tasting fresh noodles since it gives this oh so amazing sweet taste in your mouth.  Coming back soon!!!"
__label__2	This Buffalo had the worst service. We were there to watch a basketball game and in those few hours we saw our waitress maybe 3 times. Horrible.
__label__5	"Awesome pizza buffet and a great price at 8 dollars. They have a variety of pizza and keep them coming out hot as they are eaten. The crust is nice and doughy with a good crisp outer layer. The sauce is just the right combo of sweet and savory and the toppings are plentiful. I will definitely add this to my lunch rotation.

I would like to add that I was here for lunch so service wasn't a big part of the experience. Also, I am glad I didn't read the other reviews before coming as I may have ruled it out. The service was outstanding!"
__label__5	"Outstanding food.
Outstanding Service.

SMALL & Hard to get a table, but worth it if you can get in!

Love this place."
__label__4	Great food, reasonable prices compared to other Japanese-like restaurants. Glad they have tv's to watch the hockey game on. Ordered hibachi chicken, chicken was just a tad bit undercooked, but still good.
__label__5	"It's been quite some time that I've had the pleasure of eating here, but this place is so memorable and delicious that I'm going to give it an absentee 5-star rating. Never have I had better meats and cheeses in my 29 years of life. Their selection is incredible and the presentation is bar-none. 
I find myself daydreaming about St James at least weekly. I lived in New Orleans for 6 years and whenever someone asks me for recommendations for eating in the crescent city, I ALWAYS recommend st james. 

I hope to see you soon, old friend."
__label__5	Best local seafood shop. You can eat there or take it to go. Close to the airport and metro Metairie area. The service is great also especially John
__label__4	Excellent selection of meat and great quality. A little pricey but you get what you pay for here. The southwest tritip sandwich is amazing and they have a wide variety of rare meats.
__label__5	Delicious! I was a little skeptical looking at the outside of the building but like they say, never judge a book by its cover. Walked in about noon on a weekday, seated immediately. Warm chips, yummy salsa. We had the chimichanga meal, Nachos and chicken fingers and fries for the little. Everything was great, warm, fresh. The server was nice and always came to check on us.. we will definitely be back!
__label__2	"Very disappointed in the menu. The food was just ""okay"".  We LOVED The Egg and I and were told it was similar so we thought we'd give it a try. The food wasn't nearly as good, the prices were outrageous. The server was extremely nice, but that was the best part of the entire meal. We will not be going returning."
__label__5	"This is one of the best Starbucks I've been to.  The staff is always pleasant and my drink is always perfect.

For the record, I hate coffee.  Sorry Starbucks.  But they serve the best ice tea you can find.  I order black tea with no water (non-diluted) and no sweetener.  Then I can sweeten with sugar in the raw to my own liking.

Even better now that the patio is smoke free."
__label__1	I understand that there is a casino in this hotel . I simply called to ask staff if you can get a room if you are under 21 and was treated rudely and as if I was not intelligent. Even once I do turn 21 I won't come to this hotel . Simply wanted a night away in a nice bath .
__label__5	Really amazing pizza. I love the bar. So fun inside. Just a little pricey.  But it's so yummy
__label__1	Yikes!!! The rooms really need some major maintenance. I questioned the cleanliness of everything. It's in the middle of nowhere.  The caliber of the customer base was either scary/obnoxious/weird or large families with 20 small/adolescent children who take over the pool with little adult supervision. Don't spend your money here. Spend more money & stay at a cleaner, safer place.
__label__5	All of my pets have gone to Sahuaro Vista. Friendly. Knowledgeable. Reasonable. Supportive. No complaints.
__label__5	Not usually impressed by a post office but had the nicest clerk! She was super sweet and patient and hooked us up with free packing bubbles. Wish I remembered her name. Thanks!
__label__4	Oct. 20: Tucson Business Week reports that in early January 2012, El Parador will be publicly auctioned off. We have a couple months left to dine at this 50+year-old restaurant that's been am important part of our community.
__label__3	Returned a year later, also on Superbowl Sunday. The waitress today was very nice and attentive. She kept checking on us and provided excellent service. My only complaint is the lettuce on my quesadilla entree and side salad was not fresh.
__label__4	Very small, the kitchen is in the seating area so be prepared to smell the lovely Lola's aroma on you the rest of your evening. However, the food is delicious, the service is good and the Sangria is a must!
__label__5	This place is so amazing! The ladies here are a tribe! I was treated like royalty from the moment I stepped inside! The ladies offered me wine and coffee and water. It was a full wonderful experience.  My hairdresser listened acame up with a style just for me! During the pedicure,  I had rose petals in my water and leg and chair massage were awesome!  The even accommodated my boyfriend as he waited for me. I have a follow up appointment already with more to come. I loved the diversity of the clientele and how they treat everyone like royalty.
__label__3	I'm mixed on this place. The portions are completely reasonable and so are the prices. The atmosphere sucked, it was noisy and they were playing metal in the restaurant. It was also packed which created kind of a stressful environment. I would however say this place isn't really authentic, but that is a judgement I'll let you make.  I also tasted no cilantro on my tacos, I suppose I like my tacos to be a little more traditionally Mexican. Nonetheless I'd go back again if I'm hungry and in the area.
__label__5	I don't know why this location got bad rating. We had an amazing experience. Our waiter was very attentive and friendly. Our food was delicious. And the drinks were spectacular. The portion size was very generous! Definitely recommend the canejete ultimo! The bowl kept the food sizzling hot!
__label__3	Great service but it appears the a.c. went down when they left the only issue I have is with the cr I spoke to I was lead to believe there would be no charge for today unless repairs were made and I don't wont have it till next month
__label__5	Angelo is the best, super sweet and always checked up on us!! The food is so good, I love the burritos.
__label__5	Great variety of dishes and well prepared! We came for lunch and ordered the buffalo cauliflower, calamari, and fettuccine pasta. While the calamari and cauliflower were appetizers, both were quite large portions; more than enough to share. The calamari was crispy and well seasoned, the sauce that came with it was also quite good. Buffalo cauliflower was also tasty for those who are looking for a vegetarian option. Artichokes in the pasta were tender, not bitter, and the vegetables complemented the Alfredo sauce. Definitely would stop by again!
__label__2	Never again. Overly salty, mushy, nasty sticky, excess sugary Vietnamese. The worst ever.
__label__1	I would give this target a 0 stars if I could. The laziest group of workers out of all of the targets in the city. They were supposed to be open until 5, what a surprise that they closed early! And with no notice anywhere but a sign on the fucking door! every other target has updated their dumbass automated phone message. Of course this one couldn't do that. And of course they said they were open until 9 today. GET YOUR FUCKING SHIT TOGETHER. DO YOUR FUCKING JOBS. I DO MINE!! NOW YOU DO YOURS!!
__label__3	Zin was not bad. The selection was good. Wine choices were good too. Waitress was a bit eager and checked on us about every two minutes. Burger was good, fries were good too. Loud atmosphere for a date night. Next time I'll take my kids but not for another date.
__label__5	Food and service was excellent- we had the cauliflower with chili oil and garlic (this made me a cauliflower convert!) and the Chef's signature gnocchi dish, both delicious, but I really wanted to commend the service- Raoul was stellar- really appreciated his knowledge and recommendations- he was spot on. Can't wait to come back and try more great stuff on the menu and to enjoy Liberty's excellent customer service again.
__label__3	The menu basically lists everything that's served in the food court, but the bonus is you get to wash it all down with a beer...and somebody brings it to you (instead of you having to wait in line).  I had the jambalaya, which was nothing like what you find outside of the airport, it was dry and came out looking like scooped fried rice.  Service was good and quick.
__label__5	Food is amazing, and service is good.  I was shocked to see how reasonably priced the meals were.  If your in the area, you must stop here!
__label__3	"The food was pretty good, but the real reason to visit is to look for HULK HOGAN.

It's his favorite restaurant, no joke.  Our waitress said that he visits a few times a week, usually right before closing.

If you don't know who the Hulkster is - look for the tall, big guy, with the bleached-blonde goatee and a bandanna."
__label__4	Food was excellent, service was great. I think it's a bit out of the way, but definitely worth it if you are in the area. Four stars because it's pricier than most soul food restaurants.
__label__4	Good tasting and very cheaply priced Mexican food. A very thorough menu. Waiters are attentive and place is clean and well lit. Give it a try.
__label__5	Great boat tour! The captain and first mate were very informative and gave great information while on the tour. We didn't see many dolphins but the captain was trying to go around for us to see them as much as he could. If you're bring kids I would recommend sunscreen and a hat as it is only covered inside but most of the seating is upstairs on the upper deck. Would definitely do the tour again!
__label__3	Booze and tacos.  That's it.  Margaritas need more booze, very weak. I think the bar maid didn't know how to make a pitcher of margies-green water and a ton of ice....wtf   Other drinks ok  Tacos good.
__label__1	Very poor service.  I hired this company to connect water/sewer to a rental dwelling conversation.  They sold me a pump I did not need and the failed the same inspection 3 times.  Ultimately, I fired them and was much happier with the replacement.  Would not use again.
__label__3	Don't get too excited by the interesting menu.  What it offers in creativity it misses in execution. For Hilton Garden Inn though it's serviceable, if not pricey.
__label__4	I'm a big fan, but not of one of the employees who works there. She is curt and unwelcoming and does not make you want to spend a dime. The gentlemen are cool and helpful and I enjoy the fact that they always have new inventory coming into the store. I have furnished a lot of my home with purchases made here.
__label__5	Absolutely delightful a and delicious. The staff is exceptional. Homemade salad dressing was incredible. Visiting from out-of-state but will come again if I get back to Indy.
__label__4	"They got a well stocked bar, including ginger beer.
They'll pretty much let you do whatever you want. I feel very free to move chairs around to dance. You'll feel like this is ¨your¨ bar after going once. 
Bartenders seem glad to have you there, even if they are reserved."
__label__1	"What happened to McArthur's Bakery!?!
It seems like they are phasing out of business. It's the week before Christmas and they hardly have anything. Shocking. No assortments of Christmas cookies or cakes. No cheesecakes. Everything has to be pre-ordered. Then the poor things can't open till 9am. Will go to Federhoffers Bakery on Gravois from now on. It's out of the way for me but, they're still normal."
__label__4	Had a great experience buying a new Pacifica at Chapman Chrysler. The sales staff was great and our sales associate, Ken Marko, was very easy to work with, answered all our questions, and got us out of there as quickly as possible.
__label__3	we came on Monday! they were closed until Wednesday!!! They should have updated their hours!!!
__label__4	Still dreaming about that Pork Chop.  Salmon was moist and flavorful.   Relaxed environment.   Our server had clear knowledge about which items were Gluten-free, but no separate GF menu and no GF dessert items that I can recall.  She was friendly and attentive, but forgot to clear the dirty dishes from the staters when the main plates arrived.   Minor blemish on a delightful dinner.
__label__5	Best Greek food anywhere near here . Lilly is such a sweet heart and her husband is a pro in the kitchen . if u don't try this place out then your missing out seriously
__label__2	Nothing special.  If I want to grill unseasoned meat, I could stay home and do that much cheaper.
__label__5	Best pizza in manayunk! Fantastic staff and great selection of non pizza choices as well. Much better than Mike's and their lights!
__label__5	"This was a pleasant surprise!  All boxes were checked
-easy street parking
-greeted by friendly hostesses
-seated outside-great ambiance
-Chase was the best server ever
     because he was attentive and         
     really friendly. His suggestions
     for our dinner was spot on!
-love the ahi tacos!"
__label__5	"Came here a couple of times during the week my team and I were visiting from California and Arizona, it was right next to our hotel and it truly didn't disappoint. Food was great, the pretzels were fantastic (and as big as my head with amazing dipping sauces). Service was great!

We will be in town again next summer and I know for a fact we will be coming here again."
__label__5	What great food!! The chicken is huge and delicious, the rest of the food we got was just as good. The only thing better than the food were the people there. It was a pleasure to meet Al and the rest there. We will be back
__label__4	"The spaghetti burrito was really good but the pesto pasta was really salty.
Overall a good experience"
__label__5	"Wonderful restaurant, good value and great food.
I have been going since they opened a few years ago.  It never disappoints,"
__label__5	The Jam-pong is slamming! It's smoky, spicy, and huge!  The jajang myun is also very very good.  Noodles have great texture.  Food is excellent, place is somewhat of a dive.
__label__1	I'm sorry I tried to like the items but the veggie item was not good, the salmon was good and turkey was ok. The desert was not good and the potato salad was not. I've never or rarely wrote a bad review but I came based on the reviews and I was not happy.
__label__5	Went with some coworkers for lunch.  We sat at the bar and Jacob suggested a few new menu items for us.  The food was great and the service was even better!  We will definitely be back.
__label__5	Great food, loved all the salsas. The guacamole was good but you don't get a lot for the cost. Their signature dish is delicious. Very colorful interior. One of my favorite restaurants in Indianapolis. This seems like a good place for groups too, they had a lot of large tables. Another plus is that the fish is super fresh. I think they literally filet fresh fish in the kitchen, its not frozen or anything.
__label__5	Excellent! Alphonse, our waiter, was great! He made wonderful recommendations. (Crawfish bread is amazing!) and took great care of us. Everything we ordered was delicious. Highly recommend.
__label__5	Thank you to Ana and her fantastic staff for going out of their way with wonderful customer service. Always happy and ready to serve. I am a frequent shopper.
__label__5	I loved the quality of the food, coffee and service we received here. Great lighting and atmosphere. You can eat inside or outside.
__label__5	Veronica from alterations was absolutely amazing! She made me feel so comfortable, had me laughing and even let me take a sit down break in the middle of alterations lol. She was very kind and understanding. I would definitely recommend seeing her !!!
__label__5	I've eaten here a few times and ordered the dry rub wings every time. Among the best wings I've ever had. Consistently delicious. Great outdoor space. The staff is very friendly and check in to see how things are going. A great neighborhood spot with excellent food. Highly recommend
__label__5	What a perfect spot! I was in town for work and desperately needed a pedicure! They fit me right in - I was treated like a princess. Even offered wine (love that!) My feet felt amazing when I left and looked gorgeous! I didn't have time for a massage but the staff was so friendly they almost had me talked into missing work to indulge!!
__label__5	Outstanding!!! A must do if you're in Nashville. Interesting, beautiful and entertaining! Great staff and the owners are incredible!
__label__5	I was skeptical at first when I saw the beignets came with no powdered sugar on them, then I noticed the powdered sugar on the table. It was a self serve option which was pretty cool. The beignets were fresh, crispy, and delicious! I'd honestly say they're better than Cafe Du Monde. Of course if you're visiting New Orleans like I was, you still have to make a trip to Cafe Du Monde, but in comparison, I liked Morning Call's much better! The only con of this place was that it was cash only!
__label__3	Good to see Latin American cuisine in a upscale environment. The service was great the visual presentation of our meal was superb, however the food was pleasing yet could have been refined.
__label__5	"Amazing salads. We had the kale Caesar (chicken) salad & the beet salad (shrimp) w fig dressing.  My husband said his beet salad as a ""10"".   Service was friendly & attentive."
__label__2	Average to underwhelming. Decent location near conventions near Riverside. Food was typical, didn't taste especially fresh or well-prepared. Definitely not as good as other more established New Orleans places. This was more like what you might get from a Cajun food place not in New Orleans. Paper plates, plastic silverware. But prices were high enough you'd expect better. Overall disappointment.
__label__5	Tampa Int is awesome! Never too crowded, the car traffic controllers are not nazi's, and there is a cell phone parking lot for free so you don't waste gas driving around and around waiting to pick your peeps up !
__label__3	You never do know what you will get. Sometimes, pretty darn good. Sometimes mediocre. Sometimes bad. But, the prices are worth the crapshoot, no?
__label__2	The food was just okay. Service was extremely slow we waited forever for our server to bring our drinks and it took was too long for appetizers. Yes the restaurant was busy however it was not worth the wait.
__label__1	"0 effort or explanation for closing the ""24/hour"" repeatedly and randomly from 1-4am on the weekends. If you are understaffed just fix the problem, stop adding to it."
__label__5	Loved this place. Great food even for non vegans the dishes are wonderful. The baklava  was amazing and the ice cream tastes better than even real ice cream does. The dishes are well thought out and filling and the staff is kind and helpful. It's a very zen place to be.
__label__1	Ordered ahead. Not ready. Piece of plastic in my food. Food cold. Won't stay in business long like this.
__label__5	Wow best delivered food I've ever had. The driver was very polite. The food came in really nice, durable boxes, the cheese that came with the fries was nice and thick. Cheeseburger bun and cheesesteak roll not soggy at all. That chipotle sauce on the burger was bangin... haven't had anything like it since college. We ain't ordering from Freahies anymore that's for sure.
__label__4	The atmosphere is really unique. I had the salad no. 09 with grilled chicken. The chicken was moist and delicious! I enjoyed the salad also! My husband ordered the sobe chicken burger. The flavor profile was unique and everything came together to create a very tasty burger:-)
__label__5	Went here to celebrate mother's day with my mom and fiancé. Food quality was amazing and customer service was awesome like always!! You get so much on what you pay so its a good deal. we'll definitely be coming back :)
__label__5	This place was really nice. Specifically for people that are over 6ft. I was able to adjust my chair to my length versus being cramped in the seat having my knees to my ears. The service was very nice. Great massages, champagne and looks great. The place was very busy and stayed that way. So call a head to get an appointment.
__label__3	Living in West Philly, this is a local spot for local beer and pub food. I wish I could give this place more stars because it's literally 2 blocks away, but everything is average here. Food is your standard pub food, local beers at a local price, and regular ol service and decor. Nothing amazing, nothing bad.
__label__5	I went there about a month ago.  I love the vibe And decor of multicolor lights.  The bartenders are very friendly and helpful.  I tried a cage brewing peanut butter beer and I loved it!  This brewery will definitely be on my rotation for breweries to try and recommend in st Pete
__label__5	Happened to drive past and noticed a lot of cars, so we decided to stop. Traveling through Florida and had never heard of Leverock's.  So glad we stopped!  Mike our server was excellent. You can tell he knows what he is doing because our meal was orchestrated perfectly.  Just enough time between courses!  The seafood was fresh and well prepared!  Overall excellent experience! Will definitely be back on our return trip to the St Pete area!
__label__5	Great customer service from beginning to the end. Everyone was great, service department and sales department treated us great. Thank you
__label__1	We decided to come here after reading such good reviews but unfortunately we left disappointed. We arrived there right at 11 when they opened so I figured the food would be fresh. But no, my chicken fingers and fries were not crispy at all and even soggy. It's safe to say we we wont be going back there.
__label__5	Our tour guide, Jeffrey, recommended this awesome little spot.  It ended up being our favorite bar in NOLA!  Fashioned in the spirit of local historic madam, May Baily.  Believe entertainment room was once the residence of James Audubon?  Everything here is first class...decor, cocktails, and live jazz music on weekends.  We appreciated the laid back speakeasy vibe.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!  JUST GO!
__label__5	Hubby goes to Nate. He gets the best cuts he's ever had with him. The shop is SUPER clean all the time. The owner is extremely pleasant and funny. They never book an appointment ahead of yours and do a fantastic job all the time. We've been to every barber shop in this town and Cutz Unlimited is by far the best so far. Those other shops are so dirty and unprofessional!! Also... this place has the cleanest bathroom in town!!
__label__4	"Alright, Alright. Video Review.
https://youtu.be/USAg3VBi8JM
-
It's still the same taste as I remember when I was a kid. The prices have gone up but I can understand that. Very simple burger joint, nothing fancy. Typical burger, drink and fries. So if you are looking for something quick and fast. This is the place to go. The one in Sparks has a completely different vibe. Check out the video review to get more insight."
__label__5	New Starbucks in indy you say? But a very convent location on the second floor of the JW. Full service with the oven and all the sandwiches for breakfast/lunch. A great staff which handled the crowds every day. And plenty of seating and newspapers to relax and enjoy your morning brew, if you have time.
__label__5	We got off the highway to have lunch here.  Wish all restaurants had such good service, delicious and fresh food along with reasonable prices.    Don't miss this gem.
__label__4	We have been to Harvest several times. Food has been great. Party of four ... we all had delicious dishes. Their seasonal menu changes. Love that! The atmosphere is charming and service was attentive. Call ahead for reservations or you could have a wait. #Enjoy!
__label__4	Service was exceptional! Great friendly staff also good food. Took to go, However they forgot to put toppings on my Mexican madness and was super bummed it had no avocado.
__label__3	Great service, good food. We had the combo fajitas for two and it was more than enough food. The chicken and steak were nothing to write home about, texture was kind of like Taco Bell meats, but still good enough.
__label__4	My review is strictly for the desserts. I had the Creme brûlée and the Chocolate cake. Both were pretty solid. The bartender was attentive. However, he did ask if wanted ice cream with our cake which we said yes to but we didn't get. The decor was nice inside with the lights, too.
__label__3	The store itself is smaller than the locations in Devon and Plymouth Meeting but the staff are great and they have a very nice selection of fresh seafood and meats.  It can seem like a maze but the staff are very helpful and friendly.  They don't have an espresso bar, though.  Overall, it's good grocery source that's well-stocked with fantastic service but needs a better layout, in terms of aisles, etc.  And perhaps less treacherous parking.
__label__5	Fish tacos we the bomb! I had a dirty banana drink with a rum shot and it was delicious! We shared fries with crab and it was an excellent choice! Overall excellent choice!
__label__5	One of my favorite hidden hot spots! Service is fabulous, the food is amazing. A great place to bring a friend and relax!
__label__5	"Today was my first time visiting Skinjectables!  What can I say - this is such a great place. The decor is beautiful, relaxing and serene.  Reagen welcomed me like an old friend from the minute I walked in the door.  I knew what I wanted and there was no pressure from Reagen or Katie at all. Katie is amazing and will put anyone at ease if they are a bit nervous as a first timer or even as a ""seasoned"" client.  I will definitely be back soon. Love this place already! Intrigued about the B12 injections and must ask next time :)"
__label__4	Found Crowley's while in town based on the yelp rating for their burgers & was not disappointed.  Bacon cheeseburger was very good, fries were hot & crispy. Good beer selection & live music was quite good as well.  Didn't catch the name of the musicians however.
__label__1	Sandwiches are expensive and not worth it.  Scrimp big time on any meat and cheese.  Got to Primos or Paesanos in the Italian market for a real sandwich.
__label__4	Great, fast breakfast. Probably the best Americano I had on this trip. Beignets were big and tasty. Nothing special on the breakfast menu but still very quality.
__label__3	"Hmm.. this place is a bit over-hyped. Customer service was good, scenery is pretty good (they have an rooftop section) but the food was pretty basic. I only ordered the Rockefeller oysters which looked great but the taste was missing something. Nothing special.

The group I was with didn't really care for their food either. We're very much foodies. lol it's a cute place to eat if you're hungry on Bourbon St."
__label__4	i reviewed them before after very unsatisfactory results; called them recently and they were much much much more helpful than before.  good stuff.
__label__5	"This is the best sushi restaurant that we have found in Tucson.  The fish was very fresh, the restaurant was spotlessly clean and the food was excellent.  The miso soup was not salty.  

They have an all you can eat sushi option that looked like a good deal but I did not want to eat all that rice!  The food was fine dining and nicely presented but the atmosphere was that of a local joint (this is not a negative - the restaurant is quite casual).  We will definitely be coming back."
__label__5	Very busy on a Sunday morning. Service was great and food was terrific too. Try the Asiago sourdough bagel!
__label__5	WOW!  This place was phenomenal! The Ranchero sauce was from scratch, ranch dressing was homemade, tamale omelette was gorgeous & delicious! I really enjoyed the service the waitresses were very nice I love this place!
__label__3	Ehhhh. The location is nice and new. The food is all right I think about it has a small first class checkers. Chicken is a bit too salty. The burger is all right. Mine was a little burnt. On the bright side the fries are good in the shakes and donuts are great.
__label__1	Service terrible, tables dirty and not wiped down during covid. Classic philly has liquid cheese and a cold hoagie?? Server suggested crab fries, unsure why because no crab. Total $35. Would not suggest anything at this place.
__label__4	Was dragged here by a local friend, and I seriously questioned him about this establishment. But after having my first Awful-Awful and basket of fries with a chocolate milkshake, I get it. It certainly deserves all the greasy spoons awards on the walls.
__label__2	When compared to other aquariums from comparably sizes cities, this one leaves a lot to be desired. Denver, Atlanta, and Chicago all blow this one... out of the water. This aquarium has a single tank that is worth the money you spend to get in here. That one tank is amAzing, but nothing else merits the overpriced tickets. If you're looking to see some animals just go to the zoo instead. Your money will be better spent literally anywhere else.
__label__5	"This is the best pizza place to order from if you are having a party.  The giant pizza is a conversation starter and a good deal.  Just make sure you order early!  The wing everyone said were delicious.  I don't eat wings but these wings are giant!  The salad was ok but not sure if I would order again.

We ordered for delivery and it came right on time.  I was not aware you should order the big nooney ahead of time so they really made it work for us"
__label__5	Heavily appreciating these guys! They got me in last minute and got my car done fast and at a decent price! Thank you Dan!!!!
__label__4	"I have been here several times. We always share because of the large portions.  I am new to Turkish food and have enjoyed everything I've tried.  I would definitely recommend this place.   

The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is because I have had frozen pieces of lettuce in my greek salad and I was charged for a refill of my tea that was supposed to be free."
__label__1	Pumps regularly out of gas, awkward to get in and out of parking lot, rude employees and last time I tried one of their pumps was not taking cards. Done! Never going back here no matter how convenient it is in the warehouse district. Exxon is less than a half mile away!
__label__5	"Came to Maple Street Biscuit Company for breakfast and it definitely exceeded my expectations!
Their menu is great with reasonable priced breakfast menu items! The portions are huge and very flavorful! Updated and modern atmosphere. 
Ordered the Five & Dime and it was excellent with a slight kick to it which made it perfect! 
*Think of your favorite karaoke song! They will ask at the register and sing the song title for when your meal is ready! Super unique idea and such friendly staff! 
They have outside eating area and staff came to check on us! Great customer service and always smiling workers! Can't wait to go back!"
__label__5	A nice setting for happy hour with the girls or a simple outing with your special friend!
__label__1	I ran into this target shopping and hoping to grab a starbucks coffee while there.  There was myself and one other customer, a friend of the managers', and she was evidently more interested in telling him about her private life, pg, marriage being a manager etc. then even notifying me she would be with me in a minute.  Saved myself $5 on that one.  PASS IT BY
__label__4	We had an excellent lunch here today. Everything was delicious and they had a decent local brew selection. The service was also outstanding!
__label__5	Pressed Juice is a new favorite of mine. The vanilla almond flavor with almond butter and peanut butter might be the greatest combo I've had in a while. Jessi and Matt were very helpful and went out of their way to accommodate my friends and I. You should definitely try out Pressed if you haven't I would highly recommend this fresh and healthy place. The juices are delicious as well but I feel I get more bang for my buck with the frozen yogurt which is actually all juice!!
__label__4	I like that it is a buffet style place where you can eat a little of everything. My favorite was the salad I made as well as the corn bread and Mac and cheese. I wasn't a big fan of the clam chowder soup, it tasted a little too fishy for me.
__label__5	Went to salon for first time today and I will be going back. Nicole is such a friendly person and a great hairstylist. She took the time to get to know what I wanted with color and cut plus asked history of my hair.  I'm happy I found a new hairstylist.
__label__4	Nice large selection of clothes and glassware. There wasn't too much of a furniture selection, but they had a handful of pieces. Walked out with a couple of items, so I was happy!
__label__1	First their machines are off and no one can turn them on (they have been open for business 25 min) then I order a coffee and they only have powdered creamer so I ask for milk. It's .89 cents for a 1/4 inch of milk. Please. Just for making a client wait for you- past your opening hours- you could have said we usually charge for milk but let me get it for you. Won't be coming back. Rude and don't care about business.
__label__4	The wings are everything and some: size, preparation, flavor all spot on... so far in the greater Philadelphia area the best wings I have had
__label__5	Great hotel but what is greater is Williams service at the front desk. He is a valuable asset to the hotel!
__label__1	Just skip it and go to Nordstrom next door. Worst Sephora location I've been to. No one at the door to greet you and had to chase after 2 different sales associates to ask a question. They were out of tons of products and with no one around to even offer help I opened a drawer. All of a sudden a sales person appeared to shoo me away from the drawer and inform me very nastily that only employees were allowed in the drawers. I left and went next door to Nordstrom to buy the makeup I needed.
__label__1	Stopped there Sun night 6/2 around 8:30pm for take out. Picked up a cheesesteak and couldn't eat it. The wrap it was in was soaked with oil, along with the roll. Needless to say I had to toss my $9.50 cheesesteak out the window. I wouldn't stop there again if it was the last place on 73.
__label__1	I had to take my ID out of my wallet and I guess I was taking too long and the bouncer thought I was not competent enough to go inside. Not a very nice place.
__label__4	The food was very good especially if you're trying to go healthy. They have a big parking lot for eating in and a separate one for take out which is helpful. A little bit on the pricey side but other than that, I'd recommend this place.
__label__5	This is our favorite place to do date night. The best service, wonderful atmosphere, and delicious food and drinks! Don't miss out on the Brussels sprouts appetizer. Even if you don't like Brussels sprouts you will like this. Recommend reservations especially on weekends.
__label__5	"Classy, classy, classy. Was there earlier this week with some co workers and the food was unreal. All sides  are shareable and a real old fashion classy feel in the basement. They're always doing new cocktails and specials. If you go, ask for Sam the bartender, be makes a mean Manhattan. 

I always get the NY strip medium and asparagus - happy hunting!"
__label__1	"They extended an existing fence for us. The seams were sloppy, the edges overhanging...the project manager, in an email, agreed it was unacceptable quality and assured us they would fix it. After two weeks of phone tag, standing us up on an arranged meeting to discuss it. They refused to fix it or discuss it further. We had to hire someone else to fix it. 

If you like poor workmanship, high prices and lousy customer service this is the place for you."
__label__3	disappointing, even for a deli....ive been several times because its close, hoping it would be better each time but i always leave very unimpressed with the food quality and its frustrating because its all disguised as being high quality but its just not
__label__3	The experience was overall average.  I had the catfish and rib special. Catfish was excellent,  the ribs were average. My friend had alligator bites that were tough and not good. Decor is cute and service was great but food not so good.
__label__5	Perhaps the most beautiful stadium in all of football even though Ive never been inside.  We worked in the area for a few weeks and one Sunday morning (offseason) I walked down to the stadium.  I guess it was pretty boring  as you couldn't see much from the outside but being a lifelong Buccaneer fan it was a religious Sun morning.  The superbowl is here this season.  Where else can you get a cannon firing pirate ship?
__label__4	"The Fairmount/ Spring Garden/Art Museum Area was always in need of a good pizza by the slice place, luckily PIzzeria Vetri came along.  When I walked in, I was greeted by the friendly staff. I had the vegetarian slice of the day and it was so good.  It was with cauliflower, which is my favorite vegetable right now.
This is the only place you need to go in the area for pizza.
I came in here for a quick bite to eat, but I will come back for more pizza!"
__label__2	"Ordered for lunch today, as my entire office is trying to keep businesses up and running during this time. 
While I understand that there might not be as many staff members, the quality of food should not be affected. I ordered dolamdes with my lunch and they were completely disgusting. 
Mind you, I typically order these with all of my meals from Acropolis, so this is not my first time tasting them.
The sauce on them was completely congealed and thick. I tried a bite, just to see if this was just a new presentation or something, but they were even more awful tasting than looking"
__label__1	Absolutely horrible I took my daughters prom dress to be hemmed they had it for two weeks. The dress came back 2 days before prom not steamed and full of wrinkles. When I called to complain the woman who answered the phone stated it was complimentary and if I wanted to I could bring the dress back but they couldn't guarantee we would have it back in time. $30.00 to take an inch off was worth more hassle.
__label__4	Great Pizza. I had a slice of cheese and it was the perfect crust and great sauce. Also had the Caesar Salad and it was just as good. Quiet spot with great food. I have a feeling it's not quiet during the summer though. Total bill was only 9 dollars for a slice, salad and drink. Will definitely be back.
__label__1	Was there before it changed names years ago-- it was better than. Went right when it changed names and found hair in my food-- complained and got another dish-- with more hair!!! Disgusting-- skip and go to sultan or drive to Amans.
__label__4	Came into this place on a Friday night. Was seated immediately. There were multiple TVs with sports on each one. I made a request to change a channel and they took care of it for me. The food was delicious and the burgers are huge. We had the onion strings as an appetizer and they are some of the best I have had. Overall a great experience right off Bourbon
__label__5	"Smiling when I walk in, smiling when I walk out.

Friendly baristas.
Comfy seating (don't be afraid to sit next to a stranger!) 
Wonderful pours, wonderful shots!
This is a prose-review."
__label__5	This was our 2nd visit checking this place out. Our server Giovanni was awesome. He did an awesome job taking  are of us and gave us fantastic customer service. We were scoping this out as a venue for our rehearsal dinner. The lobster roll was awesome and the fish tacos were even better. If you love seafood check out this place!
__label__5	I've been hearing great things about Pots & Pans and couldn't wait to stop by. It is only blocks away from my house, so I stopped in quickly today to grab a piece to go. I chose the chocolate gingerbread pie. It is lovely. At first, I mostly tasted just ginger, but then you get the chocolate notes as well. It was a very nice, rich, piece of pie. I'll definitely return.
__label__5	Has to be one of the best places in St. Pete. This is a straight up brewery, with an AMAZING game selection. Playing old arcade and pinball games free rules. It's a super laid back environment, and the staff are very friendly and fun.
__label__5	Fantastic burritos and tacos!  This is a real taqueria with authentic and delicious Mexican food.  All is made fresh, generously portioned and very reasonably priced.  Their homemade salsas are delicious as well.  Best burritos in south Reno!  A must try!
__label__4	5 stars if this place was smoke free. I am amazed at the prices here, for sure. I'll be back!
__label__5	I'm pretty happy with the service from Safelite. My windshield was replaced at a decent price and the service comes with a warranty. Tony took care of my windshield. He showed up when he said he would and was thorough, knowledgeable, and friendly. I would definitely for auto glass service.
__label__5	This is truly the BEST urgent care in south jersey.  Easy in and easy out and they really CARE about their patients. Visited today and was taken in less than 5 minutes.  Dr Borgia has a great bed side manner/personality and of course knowledgeable.
__label__5	This is phenomenal authentic Vietnamese cuisine! I try to eat there at least once a week! You would not be disappointed. The grilled shrimp spring rolls are to die for!
__label__3	We were at supercool fun fest when we tried the hoss burger. We also had the Cajun fries which were incredible. It was good but the only reason I'm giving 3 stars is because it took 20 minutes to get my food. It wasn't worth waiting 20 minutes for.
__label__1	So the customer service has been good however I have spent over $1000 in the last year on shoes and I have been earning points well today I go to redeem my 2395 points that I was told I had to be told they are not there. I call customer service about it and I get a sorry. My daughter was so excited to finally redeem our points and NOTHING!!!! I'm over this place!!!!
__label__3	3rd stop on our top 10 cheesesteaks of philly mission.  Ive been here many times. This was my 1st ever  cheesesteak experience along with pat's. I tend to usually pick genos so I already knew what to expect here. As with all cheesesteak places expect a line. They are also cash only. I still like this place a lot. They make a good cheesesteak but at least now I know I have other options.  If you've never had obe I would say give this ace a try. They are ontbe top 5.
__label__5	My cat was itchy and licky. They gave me a same-day appointment at a convenient time. The office staff was kind and considerate and the dr. was patient and explained everything clearly. I was shocked to learn Stanley had fleas since he doesn't go outside but from what they said, it's not unusual in TN. They gave him meds and flea treatment and he's so much better already! Prices were reasonable too.
__label__5	"I've had my house cleaned by this company three times and all three times they've done a great job. Their pricing is competitive compared to other cleaners in the area. I look forward to our once a month cleaning because I know I get to come home to a spotless house. 

One thing that hasn't been an issue for us, but some may care, is that each time they've come it's a different crew."
__label__1	"We went their for lunch , I was very excited after reading the reviews.
No test at all , we ordered beef Nachos and chicken quesadillas, soft chicken tacos, hard shell chicken tacos and tostada , we all very disappointed , no flavor at all .dont waist your money and time ."
__label__4	Great wings!  It's a dive joint but WOW the wings were awesome 1 try the trash wings with any sauce on it. I had the the Carolina wings.  They were meaty and full of flavor.  The poppers were a bit disappointing but it had tons of cream cheese.  The horseradish sauce was good but heavy on the mayo. Service was slow but polite and helpful.  All and all I would say it was delicious! !
__label__4	Drinks are on the cheap side and also good name brand stuff. However the bartender made the old fashioned with a packet of sugar, not simple syrup, so it was grainy and way too sweet. We'll go back, just won't order that.
__label__5	The food was amazing and Smiley was great! The chicken gyro platter and humus was delicious. Can't wait to go back again.
__label__4	Staying at Holiday In next door before leaving on a cruise.  We were a large group they had a room in the back for us.  Our server was excellent.  The BBQ was good, my wife enjoyed the white chocolate bread pudding.  If ever in NOLA again we will come back
__label__3	"Pretty average every time that I've been there, but I know a lot of people who love it here. Typically, when I am in the fishtown area, there are few other places I would usually go, but JB's isn't terrible. Beer and whatnot is plentiful and decent priced. Food is OK, but nothing out of this world. 

Lots of people and sometimes they have live music, which is pretty cool, but I usually get the feeling I'm not cool enough to be around and move along to some place a little more laid back."
__label__5	So good. Don't miss it if you're in Tucson. This place is the real deal! Best tacos I've had outside of Mexico.
__label__3	"Booooo. This place is closed. :(

Though I hope, for the sake of having another dance spot other than Lucy's in Olde City, that this place is being renovated."
__label__4	This place is a staple. I love the Pomme Frites in goose fat, and there's a pretty solid wine selection. The bartenders are friendly and attentive, but don't hound patrons. Love.
__label__1	So it's unfortunate to have to write a poor review since it is obvious they are trying but a 30 minute wait for curbside service when it was ordered two hours in advance is unacceptable. It is inadequate management on the part of leadership and means that while we enjoy the food, we will not be returning. UPDATE: over an hour wait! Don't bother with curbside service
__label__4	Good food, great service. We ordered taste of New Orleans, and crab cake. My favorite is seafood gumbo. Also check-in on yelp can have a free dessert!
__label__5	I have been to Pie Topia several times and was impressed each and every time.  The atmosphere is welcoming, the food delicious and the service is outstanding.  Every time I go back, I try something different and am never disappointed.  Highly recommend!
__label__4	This is my favorite place to come for Korean BBQ. The service is minimal as is the ambiance but that's because the food should be your focus. Consistently delicious for 10 years straight.
__label__4	We eat there at least once a week. Good portion sizes at a great price. If you like your Thai food really hot, make sure you ask for extra Thai spices on the side, because they are somewhat timid about making the fo
__label__1	even one star is too much for this place...the worst desi food in town...it is the old new asian village resturant..under a new name...the food is terrible..not only terrible but old too...the place is suppose to be specializing in kababs...but not only a single kabab in rhe buffet....23 dollars for such terrible buffet...waste of money and time...a total mood killer...not recommended at all....
__label__5	We have been searching for a good authentic Mexican restaurant and finally found it!! The variety was good..  the taste and quality of food was wonderful..right amount of spice.. the staff was very attentive and extremely friendly.  This is definitely going on our list of go to restaurants!
__label__2	Staff was nice enough, out of the only thing I wanted on the menu, how can you be out of crepes? Sausages terribly salty, eggs soso, coffee was good but nobody would give me a refill.
__label__4	It's clean and comfortable. After ordering at the counter and paying, I sat down at a table near the window and waited patiently for my muffin and latte. My raspberry muffin wasn't too dry and had a good amount of raspberries in it. Overall the experience was pretty good.
__label__5	I've tried the ribeye at many restaurants around Indian Rocks Beach in the last few weeks and Seaweed had the best, by far.
__label__4	Sushi was delicious, rice dishes were so-so. Service was rough but it's still a new restaurant so the bar and kitchen struggled through service. Don't go if you're on a time crunch just yet. Our server was phenomenal and really tried to give us the best service he was able to give considering.
__label__4	"I called today to see what the hours were for brake tags and they are not doing them for 2 months! Such a bummer but so glad I called first. 
This place is quick, easy and cheap. When I need my next brake tag, I will return!

Update: 8/14/15 rolled up today to get my brake tag at my favorite spot and they had a sign hung stating the had no brake tags right now! So sad. On to look at other yelp reviews for a new spot this time around."
__label__4	"I'll be honest, I didn't expect much out of this place. Going by the name, I expected something like a Cracker Barrel with huge portions.

Looking at the menu, there seems to be a healthy Greek influence, so I wasn't sure how my pancakes and bacon were gonna be. Well, the bacon was PERFECT, and my pancakes were equally as filling. Nothing on our plates tasted packaged or reconstituted. I wouldn't say it was as god as homemade, but not bad at all."
__label__5	My family ate here two mornings in a row. Crowed so the locals must like. The doughnuts are enormous and delicious!  They seem to rotate the flavors daily. Glazed was perfect! We also tried the Limoncello poppyseed and PB and J flavors!  All really good!  The biscuits are killer! We tried the fried chicken/ham biscuit (perfectly salty and sweet)! Don't leave without trying the miso praline bacon!! Yum!
__label__2	Internet did not work for more than a few hours for a week straight. Burned through all my data trying to do work in my room. Highly suggest not staying here for work. Nice that they provided breakfast.
__label__5	The cheesesteaks were great! I would've liked more whiz on mine. The whiz seemed thin in consistency but it was tasty. Will definitely order again from here.
__label__1	"Don't stay here. They list a ton of amenities on their website which ARE NOT available. Renovation, ""closed for the weekend"", insert new excuse. Even the WiFi won't work. The room was disgusting as soon as I walked in. Candy wrappers on the floor. Things were all over the place. The building itself would have a lot of potential for a hotel but this hotel is just gross."
__label__5	"Not sure I would consider the Marc a French restaurant, having just come back from France and that's a good thing! 

Three words - Try the Marc. 

Had lunch here today, excellent food. Seafood of the day, Cajun cat-fish, was only $15. Where else can you get top quality food, ordered off a clip-board. Its a relaxed fine dinning meal, enjoy."
__label__5	I tried Le Reve for the first time this past weekend. They spa was clean and comfortable, and the staff were very welcoming and kind. I felt relaxed during all three of my treatments: manicure, pedicure, and wax. I am looking forward to going back!
__label__5	Been looking for a new go to since Hong Kong pearl took a dive. Just found it. Fried rice and lo mein were excellent, sesame chicken very tender, nothing was heavy or overly sauced. Place isn't much to look at on the outside but food is top notch. Give it a chance.
__label__5	This place is a gem in Hockessin!  Food is always outstanding.  The fried chicken is top notch and always a hit at parties and events.  Call and order ahead.  Because they are good, they can get busy.  Check out their nightly prepared items.  They post a menu on their website.  They also have a case where you can pick up soups, sides and desserts.  Everything is homemade and the owners are always around.  Check it out, you won't be sorry!
__label__2	Good food. Terrible service. Server was distracted and couldn't be bothered. Meh. Won't be coming back here anytime soon.
__label__2	Was so excited to see that there is finally a poke place in town, this has soooo much potential to be good but it's just EXTREMELY over priced for the amount they give you.. and when I went to try it out the other day they were out of half the ingredients I wanted... it was only 11:30am..
__label__5	Stopped into this place that serves as a mini grocery store with some neat Mediterranean foods...They also have a little sandwich counter with several choices.  Ordered a turkey bacon swiss, but didn't expect much given it was only $6 and the size of your forearm...But it was really good.  Close to home and becoming my weekday lunch choice.
__label__5	Very clean, very modern hostel. Location is right on bus line and 10 min walk from Streetcar line. Sheets and towel provided and the bed was comfortable. Lots of fun common areas (kitchen, living areas, tv with xbox). Staff very helpful and friendly. Continental breakfast with bagels, bananas, coffee, and juice was appreciated. Bathrooms were best I've seen in a hostel - there are a bunch of single rooms including a shower, sink, and toilet with doors that close. Shower is nicer than what I have at home. Worth the little bit extra you'll pay over other hostels.
__label__5	Really good pizza here. I had the pepperoni pizza and a fair amount of beers...delicious. The selection is great for both food and beer. The environment is really nice and the staff is super friendly. It's a little pricier than I would have liked, but well worth it and I would come again. Again, the staff was great (Jordan I believe), and made it easy to split the bill for a large group. Keep up the great work!
__label__4	"The food here is really good. My favorite dish to get at this restaurant is definitely the burger. The other foods are pretty good, but can be dry at times. I also really like the queso and other starters. 

The service was great, and it has a very high class or modern feel. If the food was cheaper I would come here more frequently."
__label__1	"Probably the worst crepes I've ever had. Also the eggs Benedict not really tasty. I'm from Europe and it was fare away from being authentic French. The service was really nice but couldn't make up
for the bad food"
__label__5	"In addition to providing wonderful customer service, Oscar's made me the best breakfast burrito that I have ever had!

I ordered the ""big breakfast burrito"", and was blown away by the quality of the food and how it was put together. If you would like a burrito that will change your life, go to Oscar's.

Sincerely, 

North American Burrito Taster"
__label__4	They are one of three locations in Middle TN that carries La Mer, my all time favorite skincare line. Need i say more? Okay, if you insist. They are located around the corner from Green Hills Mall in a small shopping center with plenty of parking. The store itself is small but full of gems. They have high end skincare and makeup lines. They even have a nail station (kind of strange). I went in for the cream and walked out with that plus some Armani foundation and an eyeliner by Le Metier de Beaute. A must try.
__label__2	Drinks were made great, had the male bartenders all night. However, when I asked the female bartender where the bathroom was, she was very friendly telling me how to get here by going downstairs. Coming in and just sitting down at the bar, I said thanks, where are the stairs? She proceeded to say the wood things down there with a cocky smile. Wow. As if I had been here before or seen them at the end of the room. She may need to work on that delivery a bit.
__label__3	NICE DECOR! NICE STAFF, FRIENDLY!......However the food honestly is just ok..and I had high hopes, because of the decor, where this restaurant is located and the prices to high for the quality of the food. I will stick to Olive garden or macaroni grill... And if your looking for food similar you can make the ride out to cafe gelato in newark, de. Its better
__label__5	Great place to get lost in your childhood memories of the corner candy store. Giant selection of chocolate covered goodies. I recommend the chocolate covered pretzels and blueberries or chocolate covered toffee. Some really neat gift ideas too!
__label__1	Older man that works here was incredibly rude to me. Telling me that I touching everything and not buying anything when I was accompanying my friend who did purchase something. Then he decided to vape in front of my face I had to walk out I was so disgusted!
__label__5	Blake is a boss. An expert, great prices, fast turnaround. Honest. What else do you want? Well done, sir.
__label__4	"Best ""dive"" around.  Finger licking wings, and ice cold beer.  Nothing fancy, and always a good time."
__label__2	needed to relax so getting my nails done sounded like a good start.  spent extra to have gel done so they would last longer, but I felt like the girl rushed.  after only 6 days they started to lift and are very uneven. I wouldn't suggest this place to anyone.
__label__4	I don't think the food is that bad, but then, I have no taste. It was edible, filling, and tolerably cheap, and those just happen to be my requirements.
__label__3	"It has everything you need for crafts at reasonable prices.  A good place for DIY wedding favors, kids crafts, art projects, framing and more.  And I am not one for glue guns - but wow - such a selection.

The staff is underpaid and pretty disinterested - so do your own research and then buy your stuff and move on.  There is a nice selection of Crayola and other kids craft items.

The lines on weekends can be painfully long at holiday times."
__label__2	"It's a pretty standard older style Wawa. It's a decent size and the parking is pretty good. 

The newer, updated Wawa's are much better though. 

So I guess it's 4 stars compared to a 7-Eleven or QuikChek, but only 2 compared to other Wawas."
__label__3	Good. Nothing amazing. We ended up getting a few from here and a few from Geno's to compare. I definitely liked Pat's better. The cheese whiz tastes so different and the bread was better. They also offer more hot peppers than they do at Geno's. Either way, if you're visiting South Philly, these are good places to check out. Be ready to wait in long lines and spend some time finding parking. Cash only, limited seating and no bathrooms available.
__label__5	The staff her is very friendly and willing to help me.  Free drinks in the back corner are nice too!
__label__4	The food taste good. There are rooms to improve on the taste of food, environment of the restaurant, and services for the waitress. Recommending Indian Pancake, there coconut rice and hainan chicken flavor rice. Which is kind of a specialty for PeNang.
__label__5	"This is a fantastic steakhouse with a great atmosphere!

I came with a large group, so I didn't get to order off the regular menu.  However, all the food was excellent--which is even more difficult when serving a large group.

We ate inside a former bank vault.  The restaurant itself is very nicely done, and worthy of a high-end steakhouse.

I will be back to try this one again in a smaller setting."
__label__3	Good food, but the wait for our meals took way too long. Also they brought dishes out staggered so the first persons meal was cold by the time the last person got theirs.
__label__1	Well I Tried To Give A New Salon A Try Since My Actual Salon Is Not Open . The Worst Decision I Ever Made. Not Only Could They Not Do The Simple Design I Asked For, But Then After I Adjusted For Them, They Still Did A Terrible Job On My Nails . They Kept Asking If I Was Okay Which Only Made It Worse Because They Knew I Was Furious . Still Paid , Still Tipped, Will NEVER Go Again , Not Even When In Desperate Need . Def Deserve A Refund
__label__4	"My stomach hurt every time I ate there but I would totally still go back. 24/7 eats, big menu including two veggie po'boys! Breakfast all day. Wait staff are amazing. You really can't complain. 

If you're going for the po'boy order the 1/2 po'boy aplus side combo. You can choose gumbo or red beans. 

If you order the breakfast ask for grits and biscuit. Ask them to throw some cheese on the grits otherwise it's too plain. 

Definitely a good quick meal or late night after-bar food."
__label__5	"Sampan, I think I love you.

This place is a great little find in the heart of Havertown. You want just Chinese food-they have it.  In the mood for Japanese instead? They aim to please.

Both the sushi and Chinese sides of the restaurant are fantastic. The Chinese side is typical older style Chinese joint. The Japanese side is modern and very clean and nice. The food is excellent and the prices are very fair. Everything is always fresh. The service is good and fast and the service is friendly.

And most of all, it is never crowded."
__label__1	The lady manager has no customer service skills, she is rude. The only reason I would go is because of a specific nail tech and now he is no longer working there.  I will not go back to this place.  I believe that customer service is very important.
__label__5	Great brunch experience at Etc! Probably the best burger I have had in town. The Shakashuka is hearty and healthy. Great service. We will be back soon :-)
__label__4	This place is a bit pricey if you're going there at the wrong times. It seemed like the regulars were taking the option to pay for their meal by weight. All of the food tasted great, especially all the different types of meat they had available. They even brought us out some roasted pineapple at our request.
__label__4	We eat here about once or twice a month. Of all the Vietnamese restaurants on Grand this is our favorite. But I think that it's location and it's non-Vietnamese sounding name cause it to be over looked. Service is very fast and the dining room is immaculately clean and nicely decorated. The food is always excellent and well prepared with fresh ingredients. The prices are reasonable, maybe slightly higher than other Vietnamese restaurants in the area, but well worth it.
__label__4	I appreciate this place because it saves my back and my budget. Aesthetically speaking it's a bit worn, and sometimes the staff are too. However, Iike that I can hop in and out in about half an hour. I can bring my own supplies or use theirs, which includes shampoos, conditioners, and ear cleaners. My dog hates the bath so we always get a treat of dehydrated chicken for her after we are all done.
__label__4	I go to lure to get hooked when I get hooked I'm driven under and I'm in swimming with a fish 5 acres 10 acres in a Scotland yard getting fed until I'm a big fat trout it looks like a salmon and I go to lure and I get eaten and I get regenerated in the bodies of the people that digest me because my energy is so strong that oil of my body penetrates every cell of your body and they react to that and from Scotland to Santa Barbara I am actually having so much fun.
__label__4	Best ginger beer around. The fish and chips were okay, but my husband and I loved our spinach artichoke dip!
__label__2	After all the hype, I expected better. We went for lunch and everything was just so - so. Had the porcetta and it was mostly bread. The service was not attentive. If you go make sure not to sit in the front room - it's freezing.
__label__4	"Yummy yummy in my tummy.

Donuts are totally worth the wait: they're huge, filling, creative, and simply delicious.

The blueberry cheesecake was amazing, and the almond joy was fabulous too (but could have been better with more coconut and almonds on top - or even filling?!?!)"
__label__5	Excellent tri tip and brisket sandwiches. Garlic pickles and pickled onion are perfect compliment. Fried cooked perfect. The icing on top.....peach cobbler ice cream!  Very good, personalized service!!
__label__5	Great food. Bruce, the owner is a great guy. Local, local, local. They care about  doing a great job and do. All the tacos were great, avocado fries were awesome as well as the guacamole. Try this place, great vibe. Awesome outdoor space. Dogs welcome and band on weekends! Definitely coming back!
__label__4	"Late night dining, not really. We got there a little after 1130 pm. There was still a lively birthday group there. We were not very hungry, but still ordered the Salt Cod Fritters, yummy! Based on another Yelpers review,I had the Chorizo and Clams...Home RUN! I was great. What an odd coupling, but hey, it works. My wife had the fish special, don't recall specifics, but she enjoyed it. Thank you HC SB for the great late night ""snack""."
__label__5	What a wonderful, delightful restaurant! I was visiting family in St Louis and someone recommended we try Spencers for breakfast. It was great! An older style grill with seating at the counter or in a booth. I felt like I was a kid again in the 1950s! The food was excellent, under $10 for most entrees, and came out hot and delicious. The bacon was outstanding! Next time you are in St. Louis skip the chains and try a place that will take you back in time.
__label__5	Great food ..simple atmosphere. We usually get take out. Best sweet potato fries! Ribs and wings are delicious.
__label__5	Fantastic bbq, great wait service, college town ambiance.  Fantastic meal on our trip to St Louis to see WashU!
__label__5	"A must stop for me when I visit St. Louis, always good, and this time was no exception.

But I learned something this time.  After discussing a couple of options with the waiter (Which of my 3 favorites do I want), he mentioned that I could get a side of my favorite pasta for a slight upcharge.  Hallelujah!  

Best Toasted Ravioli on the planet."
__label__5	Great wings and pizza.  We also got the cheese board, which ended up being awesome. We got the blazing saddles pizza and highly recommend it. The beer list is fantastic but wish they had a few more choices on their wine list. If you are in Edmonton or Calgary, give these guys a chance.
__label__5	"A great, welcoming space in Center City. The owners are so friendly and welcome everyone into the gorgeously decorated bar. The frozen cocktails are always great.
I wish the beer menu rotated more but it isn't going to stop me from grabbing a delicious cosmo with my friends."
__label__4	I came here to try the wine flights. I don't see those often anywhere and obsessed with them! The red wine flight came with four drinks - each of them with generous pours - for $15 before tax and tip. If you come here for happy hour during the work week, select wines on tap are half off (coming to $6-7 each). If you're a huge of fan of wine, try this place out! Please bring your vax card to enter the restaurant.
__label__5	This is my happy place. First of all... The salsa... Yum! Not that thick tomato paste you get at other Mexican restaurants! Good margaritas, affordable food, fast and friendly service.. What more can you ask for at a Mexican restaurant?
__label__4	Really good Mexican food here. Enjoy the burritos with green chile sauce and the nachos, very tasty.  Definitely coming back.
__label__3	"This place has to best glazed donuts in town. They carry another 50+ menu items. However, the other menu items aren't as great. This time I tried the 8 piece chicken wing plate. It turned out to be extremely tiny hot wings with unseasoned fries. Never seen ""wings"" so small ever. Previously tried a breakfast item and a fish plate and was equally disappointed. I'll stick with the donuts only from here on out."
__label__5	This place was greaaat.  Grilled meats tasty, seafood rice dish 5 star. Go enjoy owners nice friendly too
__label__5	We checked out this local spot on NYE and from start to finish we had great service! The food was amazing, we highly recommend the quest as an app. We came on a Tuesday so it was taco Tuesday (even better), the waitress was very knowledgeable about wat taco and ingredient and the food was amazing! Not to mention the salt air margarita! We will definitely be coming back.
__label__4	I'm so glad I stumbled upon this place while tooling around in the French Market.  As much as I love all the fattening, artery-clogging food that New Orleans has to offer, there are times when I want a meal that clocks in under 2000 calories.  Luckily, Meals From the Heart has delicious food so you don't have to sacrifice flavor and you leave feeling full, not disgusting.  The crab cake salad was excellent.
__label__5	Came here for brunch and it was excellent! I got a omelette and donut; they both were absolutely delicious. Not many byob brunch locations in bucks county, definitely makes this restaurant stand out. Definitely will be coming back.
__label__5	One of the best burgers I've had. I got the borche burger with cheddar and fries. The fries were nothing special, a bit too oiled up/ crunchy, but the burger was delicious! So fresh and great seasoning. Will definitely come back.
__label__5	Absolutely LOVE this place! Fab customer service- Don and Lisa will make you feel so welcome and right at home! Menu is fantastic and full of classic staples and delicious!
__label__5	"Had a great experience!
First time visiting the area and stopped in for dinner as we wanted a place on the water to eat.  The setup is perfect and we started with a couple margaritas which were a DEAL!  
Our server Chris was very helpful in recommending some great dishes as well as giving us some ideas of what to do around town on our stay.
Will definitely be back next summer!"
__label__5	Absolutely LOVE Ambiance nails! Vicky and Roza are great!! Place is super clean and staff is so friendly!! Highly recommend!
__label__5	Helped me out in a very tight pinch. Great work. Good prices. Wonderful service. Would recommend highly
__label__4	An interesting saloon concept. Most noteworthy is the fact that they serve bison. It's such a delicious red meat that people should eat more often. Their fries are hand cut, milkshakes are hand scooped. They even have Heinz ketchup which isn't common in Indiana restaurants.
__label__4	"...yummy...everything from the service  to the sweet Belgian waffles was amazing.
We were a group  of 6 out for breakfast brunch..had a great time and all left full 
The apple cider mimosa is definitely a must have for a birthday celebration!"
__label__2	I went to this restaurant with my family and it was my parents first dining out experience since the COVID pandemic started. We were sat near the band and while we were eating a group of 10-15 people were up dancing without masks less than 6 feet from our table. They were walking back and forth to their tables without masks. While the manager was very nice and and handled the situation once I expressed concern, the restaurant was definitely not enforcing the rules on their own.
__label__1	If you are looking for the biggest rip off in Tucson, look no further. They give no refunds and half of the games don't work. The staff are nice. If I could give zero stars, I would still give a one because the staff. I feel the prices suck for broken equipment. The facility is not young children friendly. They are not allowed to ride anything unless they are 3 feet tall. Just go to golf and stuff, I had zero problems there.
__label__4	I tried Domino's chicken taco pizza and it was amazing. They have stepped up and created such a flavorful pizza. If you haven't tried this pizza, I highly recommend it. Don't forget to sign up for their rewards program and take advantage of getting free pizzas.
__label__5	Always my favorite place to go to while I'm in Tampa! All of their teas are amazing. If you didn't like tea before, you'll love tea after you get one from them!
__label__5	Excellent variation of a solid stable of artists.. And cutting edge program throughout the year. Always worth dropping by..
__label__5	This is an amazing church! I completely recommend it! Me and my mom go here every Sunday since a month ago. We fell completely in love with what the pastor has to say about how we all are equal. Pastor Ryan at second service 11am goes into depth about what Paul is trying to say in the book of Acts.
__label__1	Only one in the restraunt. Food was mediocre at best, luke warm, when I asked for Salsa to go as they used to have an entire salsa bar, snotty, lazy employee states oh that was pre covid. Uhh hello. So was Ketchup sitting out in restraunts  but if you asked for it you could get it. Don't waste your money. There are far better places to eat!
__label__4	From out of town and just happened to find this place and remembered hearing about it from a friend who's local. Grandma Style pizza was wonderful. Very reasonably priced for the amount of food. Friendly staff, as well.
__label__3	This came recommended to us.  We live close by in Moorestown and never heard of this spot.  Tonight we had a sampling of everything and I thought it was average at best.  My burrito had almost no taste and my wife had the brisket bowl which was better. Kids liked their meals and will probably give it another try.
__label__5	I've Never a bad experience here.  Awesome mushroom soup and customer service.  Yelp wants me to write more so I can post this.  But that's all I really have to say :)
__label__4	Wonderful little bistro with a variety of food and wine available! Great for a lovely night out and gluten-free options! Definitely recommend!
__label__3	We ordered the spicy Japanese shoyu ang Goma tan tan.  The soup base taste good but not at par with other  ramen houses that I've tried in Japan. I gave it a 3 star because the take home order had thick solidified fat in the surface when we arrived home and very salty too.
__label__1	It was uncomfortable, the AC was not on. My polish on my pedicure was messy. Polish was left on my toes despite asking if it could be removed. I asked if the gel polish on my toes could be soaked off and was told no. Twice. Would not recommend this nail place.
__label__3	If you like a modern, edgy cut, this is the place for you.  Not for us.  When asked what we wanted, I said not too short at the bottom as I don't really like that look of shaved on the bottom and long on the top.  Just a trim of what it was.  Unfortunately, the cut was the close trim on the bottom and longer on the top that I specifically asked not to get.  The top didn't blend into the short section.  Waiting for it to grow out.
__label__4	"This place is a charming little place to have lunch or to hang out and chat. Quality coffee, sandwiches, and pastries. 

The sandwiches are pre-made rather than made to order, so that may or may not appeal to you. 

The one downside to this place however is that the internet is not public."
__label__5	Great lunch special. Food was good and plentiful. I enjoyed the ravioli and salad combo. Plus the breadsticks are really good. Service is good too. Good place.
__label__4	"a hidden gem in broad daylight. if it weren't for yelp, i would not have known about it, as the building looks like it is shut down from the outside. 

outer decor aside, the food was FANTASTIC. I am looking forward to coming back for the weekend buffet. This will definitely be my go to indian place in the tampa area."
__label__2	The beer is good but be careful when ordering a beer over 7% because they won't tell you beforehand it is going to come in a cup half the size as the pints! I also don't personally like families bringing their kids to bars either which is allowed here.
__label__5	Had the meat lovers pizza delivered and was excellent. Best pizza in St. Petersburg so far. Heard the anti pasta salad is excellent but haven't tried it yet
__label__5	"My wife and I popped in for boba tea and was very surprised by this cafe. They have a variety of teas and my boba was incredible.  It only was the tea great but the staff was extremely nice. 

I've got to go back soon. We cannot wait until social distancing is relaxed so we can sit inside and enjoy the cafe a bit more."
__label__1	Came in to get a quick manicure. A gentleman started my service, then handed me off to another colleague after a more interesting prospective client came in. The next woman didn't get the right description of the service I had requested so it took longer and she was rude. Further, another client came in and her service was given before mine (again) while I waited for my service to be finalized. I won't be returning.
__label__3	"Not a bad place to enjoy dinner near Opryland.

Corn fritters (their version of bread) - hot, sweet, kept getting refills of this one.

Shared the Surf & Turf with a guest. The steak (ordered medium) was a little dry but did the trick. Shrimp needed more seasoning.

Live music was cool and watching the kids run around to the pond helped make the atmosphere fun."
__label__5	Great entree special,  both light and healthy.  Salmon on bed of Quinoa with julienne vegetable, if you leave hungry it's because you didn't eat everything on your plate.  Had small sample of seafood gumbo and it was excellent.  Beautiful weather to eat outside and they have a couple of tables on sidewalk,  for now.  Owners and staff are very friendly and even walk around checking and chatting when time permits, service comes first. Locals will understand when I say between the amount of good  food on your plate and the warm greeting you get it's like going to your grandparents house.
__label__5	Found this place on yelp. Decided to try it,  we were not disappointed. There were 4 of us,  including my 10 year old son,  who had the ABC and he loved it. We tried mostly the savory crepes. Each one was amazing. And we shared one sweet make your own,  very delicious.
__label__1	"really.....you are calling this upscale.... That doesn't say much for Indianapolis...... Drunk employee, drung bouncers  and girls throwing up everywhere.  I get it that they may be hot. But they are so wasted they will never remember who you are or where they wer.  I am a huge partierand have been here several times.  NEVER again .. What a mess.... They need s good manager ....... Be careful. Lots of fights and drunk staff "" protecting you"""
__label__5	"My new favorite place to get nails done! The best prices and my nails are excellent!! I am very picky and come from Miami where nails are a staple... it has been very hard to find ""my place"" in New Orleans until I found this place!"
__label__5	We had the weekday lunch buffet which was awesome. Gumbo, fried chicken (!!!), Mac and cheese, country greens, and meatloaf. All excellent but the fried chicken was so moist and coated perfectly with the crispy batter. The country greens were some of the best I've ever had, hands down.
__label__2	"Please see review written under GLOW PERMANENT MAKEUP.  Both GLOW WIGS and GLOW PERMANENT MAKEUP are owned and operated by the same individual.
I mistakenly posted my review for GLOW WIGS under the makeup heading."
__label__5	"This place was recommended by family.  I first tried the online order which failed.  When i got there,  they were so apologetic and comped my meal!  The pizza was great!  You get to pick anything and everything to put on the pizza. Fresh ingredients and the dough is great as well. 
The staff is friendly and welcoming.  You won't be disappointed."
__label__5	This place is certainly deserving of all the Yelp love. Incredibly friendly and kind staff, clean interior with plenty of seating, self-serve lemon water...and then there's the food! I usually don't write reviews after just one meal but my shrimp Pad Thai was excellent  especially with such a generous helping of shrimp. The food was super fresh and the prices are very reasonable. I don't live in this neighborhood but can definitely see myself making a trip out here to try some more of their dishes.
__label__5	This is the most amazing idea they have ever had to stick a salad and wrap stand/place in the big cheezy. So now when my husband wants big cheezy I can still be healthy and good on my diet and get a wrap or salad !!!! The salads are huge too and the ingredient are fresh, this is something that was defiantly needed in town bc it's hard to find a good to go salad . I would def give them a try if your are looking for a good salad and good prices too
__label__1	Was here twice first time was good but the second time was horrible,  the recipes must have changed as they were very different and the service was really  bad nothing came out as ordered, I would never go back
__label__5	"I'm very happy with my discovery of trim setters. It took me a long time to find a premium modern barbershop.  
My new friend Aldo is very professional. Aldo takes his time and gives me a quality hair cut. It's well worth the money..
The chairs are super cool, and the shop is very nice. Setting up my appointments are very easy. I use the book online feature and I works great for my busy schedule..  Keep it up trim setters. Brian B."
__label__4	I have to admit that I got a little spoiled by Chicago Italian food after living there for so long BUT Maggiano's is the best in Nashville-hands down. I sat in the bar area and ordered Gnocchi with Vodka Sauce and listened to a piano player belting out Sinatra songs. All in all it was a good experience.
__label__5	Just waited 25 min in drive through with one vehicle in front of me worst service I have ever received at McDonald's and there have been some bad ones
__label__5	Desert Locksmith is a great company! I called on a Monday and they were able to come out on Wednesday. They were fast and efficient. Not to mention they are very reasonably priced. I would definitely recommend using them for all your lock and key needs!
__label__1	Why did we ever come here? 12 bucks for salad and cheap frozen yogurt. ..sigh..never again. oh and don't expect much for the service, my server would not stop talking. Just go away and let me eat my over priced salad and watered down soup. I swear the ranch dressing was mixed with milk and mayo to stretch it out. no flavor what so ever. If the kitchen is cutting corners on the ranch and soup, I'm afraid to order anything else.
__label__1	Went there last Friday with my girlfriend.   Had to wait a half hour because no tables were available.  The staff there were so inexperienced they had no clue how to treat customers.  The medium spicy broth must of had 2 cups of chili flakes in it.....it was totally inedible.  I would not recommend Pot Whale at all.
__label__3	"Eh.


Or to be more specific, bleh. 

I mean seriously now, drinks were overly sweet, even when I asked for the 2nd one to be much less sweet. 

Food presentation was terrible, and the food was middling. 

Waiter was very friendly, and helpful, but didn't actually know what was in the drinks. 

Interesting!"
__label__5	Taffy = Happiness. This place is a candy galore! Knowledgeable and friendly staff. Monica was especially informative and just simply awesome!  A must visit!
__label__5	So good, got takeout and it was ready super fast. Miso is crazy good and flavorful. You can tell they put a lot of thought into their food. I got the sushi dinner and was very very happy
__label__4	The food was fantastic. Everything was delicious and overpriced. I had better duck breast at The Cowbell for almost 15 dollars less. But hey, it's a fancy smancy place with good food, good drinks, good service, and a nice atmosphere.
__label__4	"Visited New Orleans for Bayou Classic and I knew I wanted to visit this place. I've heard great things and I was told that it is the place to eat! I ordered Stuffed crabs and they were delicious! The crabs had very little breading and they were huge! I came with friends for lunch and they place stayed packed! Deanie's really made my trip to Nola very memorable. I'm a foodie so I'm passionate about a great meal! 

Cheers to Deanie's! I can't wait to go back once I'm in New Orleans!"
__label__5	This place is so amazing. Stayed here the night of our wedding and again for our first anniversary. We had the best service and the rooms are amazing. Definitely our special place to go to
__label__3	"The ""Joe's Special Pizza"" tastes great but plan on a cold pizza if you order delivery. They must not use those warming boxes to keep it in until delivered. Or, go to the restaurant! It is great pizza!"
__label__5	Ordered delivery. They said 10 mins to make (not including travel time), & I was amazed they were fairly close to that. Delivery was quick, the order was correct, and the food was good; everything you'd hope for. Would definitely recommend.
__label__1	AVOID! AVOID! AVOID! I spent almost $1,000 for the funeral sprays to send to Universal Chung Wah Funeral recently.  When I arrived at the funeral home, I was appalled the contract Flower Shop didn't deliver the correct size of arrangements as listed on the website. They're about half size comparing to actual size. I feel like being ripped off. It's a SCAM!!!
__label__2	"It's been several years since I have been to Carlitos. The food still remains good, not great. Atmosphere, live music and cocktails have me returning for their overpriced menu. Went here for Mother's Day and made my reservations well in advance. Called a few hours prior to my reservation to confirm and they didn't have my reservation at all.  Thankfully they accommodated our party ""last minute"". The chile relleno and posole were a hit with our party. Beware the abondigas soup is sweet and has an overload of spices."
__label__5	Every aspect of Bascettis is phenomenal!  From the excellent cooked to order dishes to the family atmosphere of everyone involved, this restaurant is a marvel that you must experience!  My wife and I were there last night with friends and we are already looking forward to our next visit.  Whether you live in the area or you are visiting, give this extraordinary place a try.  You will be very glad that you did!
__label__4	I'm new in town so after asking some mechanically minded locals, I ended up at Reno Tire. I needed tires and an alignment. They came in exactly as quoted (I did get other quotes for comparison) and completed the job faster than promised! They even talked me out of an unnecessary bit of work recommended by another shop!  These Guys are Honest and they do good work!  A rare trait these days.
__label__4	Solid, tasty, filling breakfast options. The food arrives fast and hot from the grill. Delicious start to my day. The hostess is the chef's wife, and she is very welcoming with a cheery smile. Homemade pies! I took dessert for the road after breakfast.
__label__5	A little quaint diner with excellent service and phenomenal food. Everybody knows each other here! My server was very attentive but not overbearing and I received my meal in less than 15 minutes of ordering and it was one of the most delicious breakfast I've had in a while and I'm a traveling sales rep, so I eat a lot on the road. Definitely a great breakfast spot to try in Clearwater.
__label__5	"My new favorite place in the whole wide world. What an awesome selection of just about everything here. Wine, mezcal, special bourbon, plates and plates of food. 

Get the pinot tasting and a cheese board!"
__label__4	Awesome Tucked away little place in Branmar plaza. Nice custom food, unique drinks, And great portion. Great place for plans for dinner or even after a great workout. Fresh ingredients and also tasty.
__label__4	There are so many dessert places in Chinatown and I feel like they are all the same but I CE NY definitely stands out from most. The flavors are really unique. My favorite is the Vietnamese iced coffee and the Hong Kong milk tea waffle (apparently seasonal only). This is a definite must try dessert place if you're in Chinatown!
__label__5	Great desserts love the gelato flavors are always changing but so far the passion fruit and banana are the best cookies and other pastries rock as well come here on weekends for chocolate muffins and gelato also the regular staff is awesome especially marja who is great to deal with and makes an awesome coffee drink
__label__5	What a great experience. Zach and Bryce were awesome. Lots of fun! I highly recommend. This was my 14 year old daughters 1st time parasailing and she loved it too!
__label__2	I think the place is absolutely stunning- but the wait is insane! There is no way you have a 200 sitting capacity, almost half of the tables empty less than 10 people waiting and the wait is 2-hours!!!! Sad to see in less than five minutes more than 15 people walk away. The owner seriously need to consult an expert that could fix the kitchen and the entire service.
__label__1	Do not buy tickets in advance this company has a no refund policy no matter what is the weather.  You have to call your credit card company to get your money back with their no refund policy. thank god for visa.
__label__4	Eh was up earlier in the night. And as the night drug on of course I am now down. Place is smoke free which is cool, and kept decently clean. Beers are $5 at bar, but only $2 if playing. Keep that in mind. Has a ton of options for play which is nice.
__label__5	"My new favorite after work spot! The food is FANTASTIC, the wine/beer selection is great, and the staff is very nice.

The cheese platters got me hooked, but the whole menu has a lot to offer. Everything I've tried, love loved!!

Great atmosphere, great food, great people :)! I love this place."
__label__2	This review is only for the selling dept. what truly a waist of time and effort.. Brought in 60 books.. Manly kids.. Golden books from the 80s they only wanted 20 of them and offer me 6 dollars and some change.. For the rest they said we can donate or trash wink wink I'm sure they would put them on the shelves the second I'm good and gone.. I won't be back to sell ever..
__label__3	The food here is great.  There's just not enough of it for the price.  We went to Rooster and the Till for my birthday and were looking forward to a great and satisfying meal.  We we both had two appetizers and an entree.  Upon leaving, we went to get dinner...at another restaurant.  I hate to give an okay rating when the food, service, and plating were generally superb but I just don't see us going here again unless the portions or prices change.
__label__5	Great atmosphere and the service was excellent. Be ready to eat when you book here. The owner himself was there and visiting each table, you can tell he cares about the customers.
__label__1	Told it would be $89 to come out and diagnose problem. Came, spent 5 minutes checking breakers and then had me sign that it would be $345 to further diagnose and fix if a minor repair. Fixed an outlet, spent 1 1/4 hours total and included a cheap outlet all for the mere cost of $345. I told my son he should forget college and become an electrician. It pays over $250 an hour based on Bruder's rates!
__label__1	Rude and my nails looks worse than they did when I went in. How can a new business afford to act like this? They Just opened and I live close and I could have easily been a client to come in once a week. They will not receive my business again.
__label__4	The delivery was very fast and the sushi rolls are really good. Highly recommend shrimp tempura roll!
__label__3	I have mixed feelings about leaving the stars because the food was really good, but it was our waiter which really tarnished our experience. The guy literally ignored us the entire time even though there were gross right next to us which he didn't seem to have a problem doing his job with. If it wasn't for our waiter though I would have totally given this place five stars because of how good our food was.
__label__5	Amazing dining experience. One of the best tasting menus in Philly. Absolutely do the wine pairings! Friendly staff and excellent food.
__label__4	Just had lunch here with my daughters oldest and I split the 5 pc chicken strip combo and brought home leftovers the younger 2 hed corndog nuggets kids meals and were to full for the yummy funnel fries we got. Only complaint were the fries were just avarage the chicken were some of the best we've had.
__label__3	The food is fine but way over priced.  $100 tab for 2 adults and 3 kids with not much in the way of extras and no alcohol.  The decor is nice but not fancy.  They service is slow with the meal taking far too long not were the entrees bright at the same time.  I suggest skipping it for other sushi options.
__label__5	"I went here with friends who swear Ekta is ""the best Indian food in the world."" I clearly assumed they were exaggerating because I'm sure Indian food in India is pretty awesome, but holy crap was this place good - so delicious, well priced and it's BYO! We got the lamb korma, butter chicken, chicken tikka masala and a bunch of the different delicious naan flavors (there are so many!) Definitely skip apps, we got the veggie samsosas and they weren't as good as the main dishes - save your appetite."
__label__3	Loved it... my drink was amazing with lavender and black cardamom ... my hubbys drink was ok... she said they ran out of simple syrup and it wasn't drinkable.. so we combined them on our own.. we are easy going like that... the nachos were delish... good music .. cool people... no ego.. can't wait to check out the music upstairs next week!!
__label__1	Just stopped in to get a coffee and a wake up wrap. Watched the lady in the back with a red bandanna make the food without gloves on in plain sight of everyone. Disgusting.
__label__5	I am always dieting and never looking to get ice cream but went in after I heard they have low calorie/PE carb  ice cream. Much to my surprise it was a full low carb store!! I left there with (all low carb) bagels, cupcakes, donuts, waffles, cheese balls, wraps, SF coffee syrup and went back on Sunday for the buy two get one free ice cream pints/quarts. I'm so happy to have a local store to get low carb items!! I'll be a regular for sure.
__label__5	Seriously??? Can I give more than 5 stars??? What a spectacular gem. Food is amazing- fresh, abundant, quality. Service is spot on- friendly & helpful but not overbearing. Love their mission & history. Only regret is that I didn't order the bacon. It looks phenomenal. Next time. Oh- delicious coffee with constant refills. Already planning a return visit.
__label__5	OK so it may not have been over the river and through the woods... but I did take a 25-minute drive down Speedway Blvd, during rush hour. I was beating the clock before they close at 6 PM. I made it and am I glad that I did!  I met Naomi and she introduced me to the best vegan pastry I've had in so many  years!! Glazed donuts and fruit danishes and chocolate empanadas Oh My.  I will be back -- just a little earlier for sure.
__label__5	You want real authentic Pho, according to my wife's palate, this is the place to be. I on the other hand had the grilled pork chop w/ rice and veggies. MAN!!!!! This is one AWESOME PORK CHOP. That is all.
__label__3	If you want bar food and some beer it's great. If you're a foodie and enjoy unique beers, there are so many more options than here to experience. It's got a great story and good people but that's pretty much it's charm.
__label__4	"This place is great for fresh eggs, produce and Cuban bread.  Yes, Cuban bread!  It's actually the only place in the Citrus Park/Westchase area to buy the authentic stuff, so keep that in mind before you go driving off to Ybor.

Prices are great, and the staff is super friendly.  This is my go-to spot for veggies outside of the grocery store.  Plus, they almost always have a coupon in the local mail for $5 off.  Can't beat it!"
__label__5	My favorite beer hall next to Brauhaus Schmitz.  The open area middle area makes the area feel bigger than it is already.
__label__5	"This was the first year I went and I loved it. The crowds were crazy on Saturday but it was well worth it to see Patricia McConnell's seminar on Dog Behavior. 

The weather was great and I will definitely be going next year!"
__label__5	"One word - heaven.

Delicious everything. Super nice people. Weekend mornings get busy, so budget extra wait time. 

I do wish they had smoked duck breasts, though."
__label__5	"Awesome store, very convenient, and you can find all Celsius flavors!!!

Thought to find."
__label__4	The food was ok, I ordered walnut shrimp and Beijing beef with fried rice and cream cheese wantons. There was like a 5 min wait for the shrimp but it was definitely worth it since it was the best dish on the plate by far. The beef was just ok, maybe I should've asked for freshly made beef too. Overall it was decent, and Panda Express is always my go to spot for Chinese food so I'll definitely be back again in the future.
__label__4	This is hands down Reno's best gym. I've shopped other locations and NOBODY can compare. It's clean, the staff greets me by name, even when it's packed it doesn't feel like it, and the range of equipment is phenomenal. Love this place!
__label__4	Pho 75 is only good if all you want is a big bowl of noodles (no appetizers), but their soup is really good! The staff is very attentive, and the food arrives quickly. Their sprouts, peppers, lime, and basil are very fresh, and they somehow manage to keep their condiment containers decently clean. I love going here before a trip to the big Asian supermarket a few yards away.
__label__4	Love love love the design of the space, the cocktails, and the fun staff. Steak tacos were slightly chewy and the coctel mixto wasn't as punchy as I hoped it would but,  liked the guac and the puffed chicharon plus the churros for dessert are amazing!
__label__5	This is my favorite coffee shop in Reno! I love the mocha dragata and the design of the shop is beautiful. Could definitely use more comfortable seating, though.
__label__5	It's understood by the other reviews that the food is amazing, but, the tea!!! The tea is my personal favorite. I was told that it's a family recipe from Chef's mother. Makes me wish I was a member of the family lol
__label__5	This is a great Mom & Pop kind of place! The coffee was excellent and breakfast was a perfect portion size! I would definitely recommend this place if you are traveling through!
__label__5	I've been here twice for the chia seed pudding, as it's the only thing I can eat on the menu as a vegan, and it is so good!! The fruit has been fresh and the side of almond butter toast is tasty too. Everyone else with me really enjoyed their egg dishes as well! A great spot I would recommend and return to!
__label__5	"I read couple of the negative reviews and I'm simply stunned. This was The best Taco place.
We've waited for the table around 40 minutes. I would wait another 40 if it was needed. 
We've ordered several different tacos, including Baja fish, chicken pastor, red fish, spicy chorizo, roasted duck and portabella mushroom. The flavors were fantastic! I can't even put into words how good this dinning experience was.
I wish there was Bartaco in Chicago!"
__label__1	The lady completely ripped us off. Told us there was only two good options so we picked the lowest wash $16. We paid $16 thinking we were getting all these amnesties only to go through a basic car wash not to mention our car wasn't even dry coming out. Rip off. Never again.
__label__5	Berkley is looking fly after her hair cut and color. We love Furr so much! The staff is so friend and they always know who I am when I walk in the door. Thank you for taking such great care of Berkley!
__label__3	"Mad Mex is not a place you go for a nice dinner. It's a place you go when you describe your night out with words like ""sloshed,"" ""wasted,"" and ""peed my pants.""*

The major attractions of Mad Mex are the oversized margaritas, the happy hour specials, and the deck in the summer. The wings are pretty good but, beyond that, you're on your own.

*Don't pee your pants."
__label__1	The food in this place is terrible as usual. The food is lackluster Mexican food and the best part about this place is their drinks. I ordered a single ground beef taco and the taco was overloaded with spices and lacked any real flavor other than the spices I tasted. This place serves tourists and people from the county.
__label__2	$49 for two meals and an appetizer.  All meats were tasteless; 1/4 chicken, pulled chicken, brisket and smoked wings.
__label__5	The services I have received from the knowledgeable, courteous folks at Joe's Family Plumbing was outstanding. My dad was in construction for 50+ years and having been around the construction field and shown what good craftsmanship is my whole life, I can say with confidence James and his crew are top notch craftsmen. I have and will continue recommending them to anyone needing honest, caring, knowledgeable plumbers for any job, big or small.
__label__3	Food is pretty good but can leave a little to be desired. Pretty average sports bar, about what you'd expect.
__label__5	My friends and I just did a bike tour with Ollie (so sorry if I misspelled it) but it was OUR FAVORITE NOLA EXPERIENCE BY FAR!!! We loved every second of it, getting to see the city in a whole different perspective! 10/10 recommend!! Thank you so much for all of the food recommendations and for being so fun!! We will definitely be back! Much love!- Klaryssa, Kelcee, Olivia
__label__3	"I was disappointed with Mekong.  Maybe if I hadn't had much better Viet cuisine in the area, I would have liked this one better.  
The Pho was very bland, the seafood egg noddle specialty is quit a showcase. But that's where the big wow ends. The splashy noodles on a hot plate make a great impression. But, sadly it too lacks a fresh flavor. 

On a positive note, the service was great.  

It was worth a visit, but most likely not worth a return trip"
__label__5	This is only the second bakery I have visited where I have been impressed with the service, quality and where every item is delicious! The other one is in Portland Maine, so unless you're going on a trip this should be your only bakery you visit in the city. The absolute best gigantic chocolate chip cookies and the apple puff tart is a flaky buttery sin. I hate frittatas, but their take on the classic is to die for. This is a Nashville - must!
__label__5	Excellent authentic Mexican food. Lots of choices and GREAT salsa and chips. Really good veggie burrito. Will return
__label__3	it is very hard to find parking, yeah, nothing to do with the food, but it prevents me from it!!
__label__5	Great chicken dumplings amazing wonton soup and shrimp fried rice!!! I absolutely love this place and the owner Cary is so friendly and accommodating !!! If ur in the area and craving some yummy Chinese food for a great price this is the place !!!!!!
__label__5	The guys here know how to clean and repair vacuums, you can tell they are very experienced and are no nonsense.  Fair prices on repairs and quick turn around.  There aren't many places that actually repair things anymore so I was very happy to have my 5 year old Hoover that was clogged and needed new belts back like brand new in a couple days instead of buying a new vacuum. Highly recommended.
__label__5	Not only amazing food, but excellent service. We were traveling and had luggage and they helped us so much!!! Above and beyond. Food was amazing!!!
__label__3	Kinda of a wannabe Lucky Strike.  Good for drinks, avoid the food.
__label__3	"I ate here Tuesday night and sat at the bar. The food was delicious, as always, but the bartender (I heard someone call him ""Tofer"") was unfriendly to me and the customers around me and was very disrespectful to his coworkers. I will probably avoid the Soulard location in the future so as not to have to experience that type of service again."
__label__4	"Duck fat tator tots (and the siracha sauce) were such a good start to cure the hangover from the night out on broadway! We both ordered the white cheddar and bacon grilled cheese and tomato bisque. Both were very good. Only reason for docked star is that we were seated outside in the ""heated patio"" when it was very cold outside and were stuck in the corner with no heat at all. Overall a great visit and will definitely go back next time we are in town!"
__label__5	"Great quality/price ratio ! We love going there, it's always reliable and good.
Either eating there or take away, they always provide good service.
We highly recommend !"
__label__4	everyone loves this place for the pizza. i mean, the pizza is good but the pasta in this joint is TO DIE FOR. homemade bolognese sauce, carbonara and vodka pasta varieties. they even allow variations of the pasta dishes in case you don't like or want additional ingredients. everytime i eat here, i'm in heaven.
__label__1	Did not care for their negotiating techniques and went and bought my vehicle at Cool Springs where there is a much better atmosphere.
__label__4	Very good pie, except very pricey.  Love the tuna sub and whole pie.  Tastes like Philly style,  bring your wallet
__label__2	I am being very generous with these two stars. Not only did it take over an hour to deliver my food the delivery driver tried to get more money quoting a price higher than what I was called it over the phone the food is cold like its been sitting for ever & the people working are extremely rude
__label__5	I got the ribs, collard greens, and Mac n cheese. It was all delicious. Very generous on the bbq, which I love. Highly recommended
__label__4	The food is awesome, plenty of choices to select from.  There are six different types of soup base, my wife selected pork bone and it is the best.  I had spicy, it's little too spicy.  The disappointed was they ran out if the BBQ tool so we were not able to order bbq.
__label__5	Went in on a Saturday knowing I would probably have to wait, thankfully for me they had some no shows so Molly was able to assist us right away and thank goodness because she was awesome! She was very friendly and quick and she did a great job. Definitely coming back to see her!
__label__5	My husband and I have been ordering from Chan's Halal for awhile , So with all that's been going on with the Corona Virus and racist crap about China not to mention I love Chinese food ! We are happy to report that the food is still delicious , There was a mistake with our order and they replaced it and corrected it with no problem. They even delivered at no extra cost to us . Great Food , Polite staff
__label__5	Stunning food! Creamy flavorful hummus. Smokey babaganoush, schnitzel was juicy and flavorful.  Not fancy, just great, worth the trip
__label__3	This visit was my first time here. We sat in the dining area. The decor was a little artificial, but did not distract too much from the experience. The lights could have been a little dimmer - I felt like I was having dinner at noon. We loved the large beer selection and tried a few. Each one offered a very distinct taste. We specifically liked the Orange You Glad and Blackout Stout. The chili and green chili chicken sandwich were great. I will return here, but will probably sit on the patio with a drink and app instead of dinner.
__label__5	"Got my eyebrows waxed from Jamie a few days ago...they look good, esp since I wasnt expecting much from the reviews on here



update-
went today to get my brows done and literally 3 hours or so later someone stopped me on the street and asked where I go so they can take their daughter...id take that as a pretty good indicator of her services.."
__label__5	"Absolutely love Mona! She is hands down the greatest and threading. I was always scared to get my eyebrows threaded because people always used to tell me ""it hurts"". I went to Mona and it didn't hurt at all. I also love how threading gives my eyebrow that clean sharp look. Thanks Mona for saving these caterpillars"
__label__1	definitely was not worth what i paid . the wait limit was an hour, which i understand due to covid. the margaritas were very strong, but not fruity whatsoever. our meet was hard. the chips and salsa was good though.
__label__5	So Damn Good! i had dinner delivered to my house. the food looked, smelled, and tasted great. I am obsessed with their falafels and hummus. who knew such a delicious place lay neatly tucked away in a mall.
__label__5	This was our first visit and we really enjoyed every bite. The pizza was absolutely delicious with thin but still soft crust that almost had a sweet taste to it. The meat on our pizza was smoked and cured. No pepperoni out of a freezer here! There's outdoor seating and inside you can watch them pulling pizzas in and out of the brick oven! Also, gorgeous and delicious salad choices!
__label__4	"Second time coming back! I'm not sure how they get this amazing char flavor on their fried rice and Pad Thai, but it's soooo good. Spice levels were spot on. 

We had some issues with getting tea, at first our kettle didn't have hot water and our waitress did go get more for us, but the second time it didn't hold heat very long."
__label__3	I'm giving three stars for selection and most of the sales people. They do their job which is to help you buy furniture. I purchased a lot of furniture and appliances here. The largest was 4 complete kitchens. I never felt valued as a customer. I had to call repeatedly to learn the status of orders. Even the warehouse people were shocked at the lack of cooperation I received from the cashiers. My last delivery entailed me getting my construction crew to pick up order so I could have it on time. Great selection, nice salespeople and good pricing.
__label__1	"Don't bother making a appointment you will still wait 45 minutes. Poor and small selection of non gel colors Won't be back, and don't recommend.
I have never been offend by the employees speaking their own language but it was so extreme at this place and the laughing and pointing was outta control. I have never ever not left a tip but this place me and my cousin only paid the $25 no tip. Highly recommend not going here and wasting your money for crappy service!!!"
__label__5	What an awesome spot, all vegan and delicious,  I'm a carnivore personally and  enjoy my  red meats. But this food is seriously delicious and seasoned to perfection.
__label__5	"Excellent service and food. I had the Boardwalk Special Omelette with hash browns and toast. My only complaint is that the portion was huge. It was awesome, but more than I needed. Unfortunately I have a bad habit of eating everything on my plate. 
For anyone else from Austin, this is the St Louis version of Magnolia Cafe, or the original Omlettry. 
Service was prompt & professional. Prices were on the low side. This is a great value for your money. 
Overall a great experience. Highly recommended!"
__label__4	This place is quick. Everyone in here is helpful,the service is great and my pedicure lasts for at least 6 weeks!
__label__5	Love this place. Prices are excellent. Really good food. Bread is delicious. Service and staff are very kind. Inside it's cute and very clean. Great little place. They have some very reasonably priced family type meals that have several things in them that keep groups happy. Go there regularly
__label__5	My father is a WWII Veteran and I took him to Applebee's for Veteran's Day. Applebee's did a fantastic job to honor our Military people who have make huge sacrifices for us. Food was awesome and our waitress Nadine was awesome! Thank you Applebee's!
__label__4	Food is great but not a local favorite...sorry! This is a tourist spot all the way!! Great seafood, great food, a bit pricy though, but way to busy for us locals!
__label__1	Lousy and crusty ..very little sauce and cheese. Bubbly nothingness. Go elsewhere, plenty of good pizza spots in the area.
__label__1	Worst place to bring your animal if there's an actual emergency! The receptionist is rude and the dr has no clue what he's doing. I brought my frenchie in for a c-section and lost the pups because the doctor had her waiting in a cage for two hours and insisting she push the puppies out. Anyone in the animal medical profession should have the common knowledge that it is dangerous for French Bulldogs to give birth natural. They should be shut down!!
__label__5	We had a great experience with Caudle vet. We brought our kitten here for a spay. Unfortunately, the first night home she got out of her cone and pulled her stitches out and bit at her wound. This ended up causing her incision to have some issues, which ultimately needed to be opened back up and repaired. Dr. Panda and the staff were incredibly helpful with this and saw her again multiple times after to make sure she was healing well. She is now back to normal and doing well!
__label__5	You have to visit this little sweet spot in the factory. The donuts are crazy delicious with wild flavors. So good
__label__4	I went here for a birthday just the other night. First impression: the bar area is too small and narrow, but hey, most Philly bars have the same issue. After four hours of fun, I can say that the place looks awesome inside, the dance floor was popping off with excellent soul music, and the whiskey sours are legitimate and incredibly delicious. Bartenders are nice. My reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is that they really need a coat rack and the cheaper beer prices are a few dollars higher than most bars in the area. I will have to return and try some bar food next time.
__label__4	Never eaten Hiroba before. Their service was great, kept the water refills coming. We ordered the Godzilla, King Kong and the border. All of them were pretty good. I would Come back again.
__label__5	Whiskey Lounge is one of the best lounges I've been too. Such a great selection! A lot a variety that you would never think of. I'd highly recommend Jefferson Ocean! Best whiskey around. Come in and have a drink. You won't regret it! :)
__label__4	Needed a pedicure desperately including callus removal.    They way they did the callus removal was different than any other place I have been to.  Normally they put gel on & then wrap your feet in plastic & warm towels.   This place brushed on a gel, and then had me sit for a few minutes without wrapping the feet or anything.  Got home and the calluses were gone much better than ever!  I will go back!
__label__2	I expected a lot more out of an $80+ meal.  The service was the only saving grace at this location.  Howard was our server and he was fantastic.  He was always around when we needed him and was extremely friendly.  The crab cake sandwich had very little flavor.  We loaded ours up with tarter sauce because it was dry as well.  The fish and chips was a big portion, but again, lacked flavor.  Do yourself a favor.  Save your money and just go to the food court instead!
__label__3	I ordered the steak and cheese sandwich which was full of flavor if you like onions and peppers. The meat was a bit dry however not bad enough to ruin the sandwich. Atmosphere is comfortable and clean.
__label__5	Literally one of the best restaurants I've ever been to. I got the Red Snapper. Sides - mushroom risotto and crawfish fritters. They do have a dress code, so we lucked out and grabbed a table at the bar. We got the pork belly for an appetizer. Go here! OMGGGG
__label__4	I stumbled upon this place with a couple of friends.  Their selection is amazing. Everything looks super sugary and delicious. The staff was very helpful. Good luck deciding!
__label__2	I live just up the road so I go here nearly every week. After 40+ visits to this place I can say with confidence, they have the slowest check out process in the world. Today I had a guy finish ringing up and pay for his item who was behind me in line before I even received my items from the bagger. I had SIX items, SIX ITEMS!!! The guy behind me had ~10 items. This is a weekly occurrence.I have no other complaint besides severely inefficient checkout.
__label__4	"Excellent service!  Bartender was super friendly and helpful! 
We had a mushroom burger that was super delicious!  Would definitely recommend! 
Was nice to have lunch and be able to chit chat 
About our fabulous time in Nashville!"
__label__3	This place will surprise you! It looks like a dump on the outside but when you walk in it's pretty descent. I can tell they have regulars and some newbies. The crowd is a mix from early 20s to 70's. Everyone is friendly and you can't beat the prices on drinks. Even the bathroom was descent with toilet paper. I'm not trying to be funny, but some dives you usually are afraid to rub your eyes or drink from a glass. I'm not saying I would eat off the floor but I am saying I will go back.
__label__5	Amazing food! We tried the chicken tacos, the vegetarian tacos, the rice and beans, & a couple of other dishes. The meat was seasoned perfectly, and the staff was extremely friendly. Highly recommend!
__label__4	"Really loved the beer, but not the seating- or lack there of.  Honestly, we didn't plan the arrival for the two of us to have a few beers and grab something to eat we'll.
2:30 Saturday afternoon was packed! Had 2 beers and then headed out!"
__label__5	Great limo company. We used this company for my wedding. They confirmed ahead of time. Reasonable price. Clean limo. Very friendly driver. Showed up on time and were very accommodating. I would definitely recommend them!!
__label__4	"I love the sushi here! Last few times I've been though I just got the potstickers and shared chicken teriyaki with my husband. There was plenty for us to share. He doesn't like sushi so I only get it when I am with friends. 
The mistake roll is awesome."
__label__5	"We came here for an afternoon drink on a warm and sunny afternoon and stumbled upon this place at the end of Tampa's riverwalk.  Located right on the water overlooking downtown, Steelbach is a fantastic place for brunch (and more importantly) great drinks.  

I had the mimosa flight which was an amazing assortment of four mimosas.  From carrot, to cucumber, strawberry, and even lemon mimosas - this was an experience that was perfect for the afternoon.  

Highly recommended."
__label__3	"We ordered the Brussels sprouts salad- it was a bit too sweet for my taste, but overall very good and crunchy.
The rolls and the soups were not good. The rice was overcooked and the fried fish inside tasted like it had beed fried the day before. 
Good service!"
__label__5	Great prices! Love the airbrush tans! Never walk out orange and the beds are super convienent. They have great customer service and are always willing to help someone out.
__label__1	"Awful! They put chicken in my stir fry when I did not order it. I am a vegetarian. The slip said ""chickpeas"" NOT chicken. They were loudly slamming the pans and sloppily putting the food in containers. There was food all over the outside of the container, which got all over my hand. Go to Honeygrow instead, much better."
__label__4	Best non dive Irish bar in New Orleans. They have a full Restaurant too and music upstairs.  The have a great selection and a bat menu. I'm unhappy that they took the cheese off if the menu, esp for the bar food.  The volume in the Bar is good, so friends can easily converse and relax.
__label__4	Place is small but super fun. We were expecting jazz but got island music instead ---equally fun!!! The bartender with the bold head and black glasses was awesome!!  He was on it--refilled water and wine constantly.  We also ordered food from a different restaurant to be delivered to us.  There's no kitchen so don't come hungry.  Last,  we walked and honestly it was not that bad and I'm pretty fancy pants ;-)
__label__2	"Coulda been better, coulda been worse. 

The wings were soggy and the spinach ricotta white pizza was way too rich. 

I sincerely hope this isn't the best Philadelphia pizza has to offer"
__label__1	I have been here several times. Not sure what all the hype is about on this place.  I can't disagree that the atmosphere is nice.  On the other hand, Rich the host couldn't be more of an a$$. Once I was looking to set up a meal for about 20 people.  After asking some basic questions about price, options and wine he basically blew me off.  Poor service, below average food and overall not worth the money.
__label__3	Ok the acoustics are amazing.  It's full of snobs but what the heck.  I went to hear Mozart.  They threw in two songs that sounded like Yoko Ono being channeled thru Symphony Instruments...stick to the darn plan.  The Mozart was great...the other two songs sucked.  They seriously sounded like background sounds for a made for TV movie.  Stick to the plan...Mozart and save that crap for after midnight Rocky Horror Picture Show crowd.  If I was Martha, I'd want my money back.
__label__5	We came for #CLBurgerWeek & we were not disappointed! The Irish Burger was delicious! The fries were amazing! We also ordered a Scottish Egg, and it was absolutely incredible.The only thing that would've made our meal even better would be to sit outside....but, alas, they only have 2 tables on the *patio*. Our server was attentive, and our burgers were perfectly cooked. We'll definitely be back!
__label__1	"I will no longer be ordering über cars anymore, as they have kicked it up too many notches with the incredibly unpleasant ""car perfume"" that also happens to be a neurotoxic slow poison.  I keep having to roll down all the windows and even with that, my husband and I have a hard time breathing in the car.  Just awful."
__label__5	Great bagels and coffee. Very friendly staff. Nice clean location very easy in and out.
__label__4	"It's a fun store, though it can be overwhelming.  They have soaps and other skin care products.  Lots of scrubs, creams, and things to keep you clean and moisturized.  There are also hair care products.

It's a bit more hip and seems more natural than Bath & Body Works.  The packaging is fun, and there are some interesting combinations of ingredients and scents.  I like to buy gifts for friends here.  It's a bit expensive for me to use their products every day, but as a splurge for a friend it's fun."
__label__2	"Service and food definitely does not measure up to the prices.  Entrees are huge and literally swimming in sauces.  Must have been told a dozen times to ""Enjoy"" and constantly were asked, ""How you folks doin'?""  At every step along the way, we were delayed with explanations that the drinks were being prepared, the bread was being toasted, etc.  Place needs to decide if it's a bar with food, a pizza place, or a fine Italian restaurant.  It's trying to be everything but needs a lot of work."
__label__5	"I bike all over NYC, so for my first time visiting New Orleans, I wanted to do a bike tour.
My gf and I found Bob to be friendly, informative, easygoing, and very attentive.
The ride was about 20 miles, but since there are very few inclines, it was not difficult.  What a great way to see the city, the neighborhoods, and the sites!
I highly recommend it!"
__label__3	"High level diner has been around for many years and if you want home cooked food this is the place for you! They make all of their sauces in house and have a variety of food for all diets.
I wouldn't say it's fantastic but it's alright. I prefer their lunch menu to the breakfast. Every time we have ordered breakfast we have been disappointed. It has been very greasy and lacking flavour."
__label__1	"What a screwed up order. I ordered fish and chips, plus a side dish of Coleslaw. I gave specific instructions on how to get to my house.  Grubhub didn't follow my instructions, Bullys blamed grubhub for not bringing my ""chips"", how would that be their fault? Bullys wants me to call grubhub about the ""chips"". Please
 Miguel, I'm over this and will never patronize either of you businesses again. What a cluster. How is it the delivery services problem the Restaurant didn't fill the order correctly."
__label__4	We went here for dinner last night after hanging at the dog park at Metazoa across the street. They didn't have any open outside tables when we got there at 815, but they quickly pulled one out and set it up for us which was so nice! It was a nice atmosphere on the patio, our server seemed kind of tired bc it was late but he was helpful and nice. I got the udon noodles and my husband got the pork ramen, and they were flavorful and great for a cooler fall night. I recommend this as an after dog park stop.
__label__4	"Was it the best burger I ever had?
Probably not, but it was definitely a great burger.
The meat was perfectly cooked and was very juicy. 

I also thought having the loaded potatoes instead of fries was a great idea!

I totally recommend getting the Mushroom Cheeseburger!"
__label__1	Worst Wendy's ever! 9$ for a combo and it's horrible cold and very old cheese! It has been horrible for years and I'm not sure why this place hasn't been closed down!!! They never say hi or thank you!
__label__3	This is my favorite smoothie place, started going to it in Florida and I always crave it. I was so excited to see one in PA!! After finally going to it, we had to wait 3 minutes for one of the employees to just acknowledge us and then our smoothies not taste like they usually should, it was quite a disappointment and a turn off.
__label__3	This is an OK sushi place. Price is good. Quality of food is fine. The sushi is not very impressive.
__label__5	For a great restaurant like that they should not hire chad as he was diagnosed as schizophrenic the minute we met him on top of it all multi personality just to complete our experience. As far as the food goes amazing and marvelous the sushi will forever be the best
__label__5	Bob and Andrew are awesome! I'm not super comfortable with guns and they both were very understanding. Originally I rented a intimidating gun, but they pointed me towards a 22 and were very encouraging. I would most definitely go back!
__label__5	Hot dog variety is good, a bit overpriced but it's rare to find a place that would serve a turkey hotdog these days
__label__3	All 3 bartenders I dealt with were great. Fun, prompt, attentive. Don't always get that in most places. Had a burger and fries, it was mediocre. Not too upset, the price was fine and it's just standard bar food. Beer selection was decent, not great, but they did have some craft beer choices for a snob like me. Biggest issue was that the TVs at the bar are almost directly over your head, went for a football game, my neck was sore by halftime. Also didn't appear to be on the HD channels.
__label__1	"This guy came recommended by the front desk in my moms building in center city. I knew she needed a new battery in her safe and suggested she call them.  They responded with no can do. We will replace the safe with a new one for $500 and hung up the phone on her. 

We called another locksmith who came out and changed the battery 


Not great customer service. 

He might be popular but I would not use this service"
__label__3	"You certainly don't come to Marshalls for the customer service.  You come here for the cheap prices!

They have a nice selection of children's books and clothes.  They even have kitchen ware and unique cooking ingredients.  I just picked up a 12"" cast-iron skillet for $10.  That's hard to come by.

There's much more to Marshalls than kids stuff and kitchen ware.  They have good deals on men's and women's clothes and shoes.  You just have to be willing to look through everything to find a gem."
__label__5	This place was HIGHLY recommended by another friend. We love good Greek food. This place is top notch. Was really impressed with their homemade garlic mayonnaise. What really put it over the top was HOMEMADE ketchup!!! It was sooooo good. Really looking forward to going back.
__label__4	"If you're looking for Poke...come to this place...
Fresh scallops...it's not the all you can eat type but  wish it were...
Spicy Tuna...big squares and tasty.
I really liked the option to build your own poke  bowl with 6 different options of protein. 
Everything was delicious, fresh, and amazing. We will definitely be back!

FYI - There was a sign on the door they will be closed on Sunday's until further notice.they

No alcohoh...is served...."
__label__5	"Great food! Try the specials. I love the shrimp tacos and highly recommend them. My wife just loves the chicken with capers and the bread is soooo good.
Prices are reasonable and portions great.
Give them a try."
__label__1	Really enjoy their food, but the service is disappointing every single time we stop in. They are lacking in employees and/or the knowledge of how to effectively run a restaurant since the line to order takes 15+ minutes, followed by waiting 20-25 for the food. Even receiving the drinks we've ordered is seemingly stressful. The couple in front of us were so upset today they just walked out.. Won't be returning in the future! :(
__label__5	"Best BBQ the boyfriend (recently fiancee) and I have EVER had. Hands down, the best. We biked here from the French Quarter, which I would highly recommend doing as it's a bit of a walk. I had the ribs and he had the pulled pork, which he can be quite picky about even though he is from PA. We sat outside next to the smoker and smelled like BBQ for the rest of the day, which only served to remind us of our fantastic adventure to the Joint.

Out of towners, this place is not to be missed!"
__label__1	Our zoo is mediocre as best. Paid 50 bucks and was done in 1 hour- each time we go- and that's experiencing it all. Good for a family day w/ kids if you don't have the time to road trip to Cincy, Columbus or St Louis zoo's.
__label__3	"Been here twice, a turkey sandwich, chicken salad, and hummus is the extent I've been through their menu.  All of them were just OK.  Nothing creative or unique here.  Tasted like I slapped some ingredients from the grocery store together myself.  Maybe that's the point?  I guess they're doing something right if they're popping up everywhere.  I'll look to try a salad next time.

If a friend wanted to go here I wouldn't protest, but probably not actively electing to go.  That's where I fall with Zoe's."
__label__3	"Was just Ok.  This was July heat wave and some people chose to eat outside.  So the rest of us eating inside we're going to have to endure the heat and flies coming in.  Waitress did close the door upon request.  Eggplant Parmesan PO-boy was not good, but I should have known better than to order something like that.  Catfish Acadian was ok according to husband.  
Better places.  We really liked Joey K's which isn't far away."
__label__5	First time here, not too busy for lunch on a Sat and enjoyed while there were TV's all around, it wasn't noisy. Very relaxing vibe for a sit-down restaurant/ bar. Even video poker here. Food was great quality and value (along with the breakfast), it came out fast too, and workers all very friendly! Will definitely return!
__label__5	Loved it! Had a terrible experience; well several terrible experiences w/my former groomer (to remain nameless). I yelped in search of a new spot who'd take great care of my Pug children & decided to try Furbabyz. I was not disappointed
__label__5	my favorite go to spot! Everything is cooked to perfection and the flavors are amazing. The seasonal menus are creatively delicious. And the desserts.. wonderful! My family and coworkers love when I bring in their made to order cakes. Not overly sweet like most desserts. My mind is put to ease knowing that when I order I'm getting healthy, fresh food.
__label__4	Great food. Never been disappointed on flavor or how anything has been cooked. However, on our most recent visit many of the beers on the beer list were not available, which is frustrating. We like visiting WOB while traveling to try local brews. Also, this place was very busy! The staff was great and quickly seated our table of 5. Gina, our waitress was so sweet even if some of our crew came on a bit strong! Overall good experience!
__label__3	"Fun for a laugh. Crazy, dirty, but cheap, cheap, cheap pitchers of PBR. Don't take this place too seriously and you can have a great time. It's a trailer park-themed bar with ALL of the fixins'. Seriously.

Lots and lots of smoke, though. Ugh..."
__label__4	What an amazing find!  Will totally be back. Owners are super sweet and the food is just what we hoped for. The hush puppies??  To. Die. For.
__label__1	There are many great things about this bike shop--but if you read the negative reviews, they're all about the woman who runs it, who is rude and belittling. I bought a bike here because they had the one I wanted in stock (and I'm happy with the bike), but I'll never shop here again because of the customer service. Many friends of mine have similar complaints about this woman. Sad, because this shop has so much potential. Especially because I always want to support female run businesses.
__label__2	Couldn't have been more disappointed in my experience with a to go order. The August special burger was disgusting. The guacamole was old and brown looking. Cole slaw had zero crunch to it. And I asked for a medium burger and showed it to the group I was eating with and they all agreed it was a rare burger. I'll go here again, but only for their beers. The food was so blah I'd rather have eaten Little Caesar's.
__label__4	First time I met an automated waiter/server!  This is the best pho Vietnamese restaurant in South Tampa. On a Chilli day, I live the spicy Bun Bo Hue pho. Absolutely love it with the rice noodles versus the thick noodles.
__label__5	We rented a car from here a few months back and had no problems whatsoever.  I forget the guy's name that helped us but he was very tall and very nice.  And we loved the Subaru Outback that we rented so much that we ended up going out and buying one to replace my Equinox that burned up in a fire at our vacation home (the reason why we needed to rent a car in the first place).  Overall, it was a great experience and we would rent from there again for sure.
__label__1	Have gone twice in the past month and I am never to return ! I would rather pay 30 bucks a ticket at Cine bistro so I do not have to encounter the rude movie goers whom speak loudly through out the movie.  I complained once to a staff member after a group whom I believe didn't even pay to see the movie (theater hopping, due to the assigned seating ,they were shuffling around when paying customers arrived ) he stated he would send an usher in yet no one ever arrived.
__label__1	Cheapskates, liars, rip offs. Don't ever order from here. They don't know how to get a simple order right and then try to charge the customer extra. Rip off!!!!!! Guys that work there refuse to work with the customer. Don't waste your time or money. Guy at the register needs to be fired!
__label__4	I stopped by after work and ordered chicken tikka and garlic naan. Both were good!! The chicken tikka masala was very flavorful..yummy!!! I ordered carry out so I could enjoy my dinner at home. I must say it still has a kick on even the mild...you must stop by to visit.
__label__1	Very poor customer service. I had to wait to try on clothes for at least 5 minutes even though a dressing room was open. The manager thought it was more important to finish giving a lecture to an employee right in front of me before they would let me go into the dressing room. Won't be back after seeing how they treat their employees and customers.
__label__5	We stopped in this past Sunday and loved it.  The new place is cute as hell and the rock stars that made AJ's great all seem to have made the move.  They're still working through issues with the regressive PA liquor laws but I'm confident they will sort everything out in short order.  I'm munching on my leftovers now and they're still delicious.
__label__4	Very nice people here, the weekend bartender is a kinsman so of course he's cool. Parking is valet at the Legacy so stay a while and party your fool head off.
__label__2	"Burrito was ok - had some spice, but no other flavors. I've had better burritos at the national quick-casual chain restaurants. Corn tasted like it was cooked some time the day before.
Atmosphere was on par with another national chain ""neighborhood bar & grill"" that probably has burritos for half this price.
The staff was friendly, though.
Bottom line: Don't bother"
__label__2	Was excited to try this place because of the reviews, but very disappointed with the food.  The sauces were good.  Alfredo sauce very good, and pasta al forno was good, but the chicken on all of our meals tasted like the bagged frozen chicken from store.  Staff was courteous, and service good, but won't be returning.
__label__5	Delicious sandwiches, outstanding customer service, and a beautiful cake. They were also very accommodating of my onion and garlic allergy. Great business model
__label__5	One of my favourite Japanese Restaurants! Plus it's super easy to get to! The staff are very friendly as well!
__label__5	Best ice cream! Made fresh in store. My husband and I shared a waffle cone with one scoop butter pecan and one scoop Nutella...it was amazing! Can't wait to go back and try a Popsicle or the flavored water!
__label__5	First time eating there, my friend raved about it. It did not disappoint. Loved my custom pizza. And with several food allergy's in the family this place was really easy to accommodate all our needs. The staff was friendly and very helpful.
__label__3	No  WiFi here which is not what it says on the window. The food here is ok, the location itself is sort of a homeless haven so that's disappointing. I like the big cheeseburger myself but sometimes the chicken fajita pita is a good option. The menu seems to continue to expand and I don't think that adds to the quality of the restaurant.
__label__3	Food was good, but it was a little overpriced. Our server sucked though..necer got his name and he was not friend or quick by any means. The scallops and catfish entrees were good.
__label__3	"Definitely a must see when you visit Philly. Very busy and something for everyone. From places with seating to takeout to vendors with merchandise. Will take awhile to snake through and see everything!

Unique in it's age and building, which is pretty cool. If you are a local a place to frequent and be proud of. As a visitor it was worthwhile and I'd stop again, but the variety and prices aren't much different from similar markets in DC, Lancaster, Chelsea in Nee York, etc."
__label__4	Very very vast. Many stores and restaurants and a very nice Simon Mall. Lots to do including a water park, Dave and Busters, etc. The only reason I am giving it a 4 and not a 5 is because I kept getting harassed by the people with vendor carts in the middle of the aisles selling aging cream and hair straighteners. They kept walking next to me and calling after me to try their products.
__label__1	"Tried to visit today. They won't even let you in without a tour guide. No one greets you, they just hand you a piece of paper with a bunch of phone numbers on it and say ""you've gotta have a tour guide""."
__label__1	Very disappointed that they no longer offer happy hour on Friday. Way overpriced without it. Since they print the beer list daily, they really should not include the happy hour section when it does not apply. Will not be back any time soon.
__label__2	After reading the reviews, I was super excited to try this place and especially the lobster bisque! Unfortunately, it wasn't what I was hoping for. The base is tomato and tasted more likes tomato soup than bisque. I wasn't even aware there was a type of bisque that wasn't cream based. Not being a tomato soup fan, this was very disappointing. Also, I didn't really taste any lobster. This place has a great environment and amazing views, but the bisque was a let down.
__label__5	Amazing potato salad.  I crave it.  Staff was friendly too!!! I wish I could make potato salad like them!!
__label__2	I came here yesterday for business and loved it.  Different story the second night sitting in Bar area.  Waitress was more interested in speaking to neighbor table about Amsterdam and fiancee.  Clock in at 12 minutes.  Finally had to get up and ask for Mgr before she came over to my table.  Assist Mgr was really apologetic but not waitress.  Will come again but not with this waitress.
__label__4	A great dive.  Service is bent towards regulars, which is fair.  It gets a little gnarled on weekends, like dicey.  But the beer is cheap and there are 10 excellent pool tables.  A lot of action on weekends, don't take put any real money unless you're willing to get hustled.  There's a Vietnamese buffet at lunch which looks a little tired.  Very decent burger/onion rings on the menu.
__label__1	This place was terrible !!! Service was terrible and food was terrible it was your typical tourist trap DON'T GO!!!!!!!
__label__5	Fantastic meal. Would recommend to anyone! Staff was fantastic, food and presentation were wonderful. Great time.
__label__1	If I could give negative stars I would. DO NOT FINANCE THROUGH THIS COMPANY. The policies surrounding payment schedule changes and deferments are set-up almost as if they want you to default. I've never had a late payment and have almost payed off my almost 30k loan and they still treated me like a leper when I requested a deferment. Avoid at all costs.
__label__1	This place is dirty and the rest of the items are expired.   This place is not worth the dirt it sits on.
__label__5	"My favorite spot in Clearwater beach.  They have great frozen drinks and a selection of apps.  And at sunset, they served a complimentary sunset shot which was out of this world  
The nachos plate was huge and filled my friend and I up for dinner. The views, complete with rockers for watching the sunset, makes this a must stop.  Parking is easy right beside the bar with a public lot running about $3 per hour."
__label__5	I hired Cervino to disconnect and reconfigure my 2 HVAC units as I was having some other work done on my house and crawl space. George and his team came out and were very professional, knowledgeable, and helped me troubleshoot some issues that came up along the way. I appreciated his approach to offering a few solutions to the issues, as well as shooting straight with me along the way, ultimately getting everything back in good working order. Happy customer here!
__label__5	These guys were awesome. My regular plumber was out of town and I had a bad leak I needed diagnosed In a hurry. Drain Doctor delivered! The floor boards beneath my bathroom were dripping through the basement ceiling and I couldn't figure out where the leak was coming from. Bathtub? Sink? Toilet? After my initial call, Drain Doctor was at my house in less than an hour. Gary was great to work with and did solid work. I will definitely be calling them again! Thank you Gary & Drain Doctor!
__label__5	Wonderful place to hang out, relax and chat with friends. Super intimate. Very old school. Love.
__label__4	Consistent quality with super fast service! If you order for take out, your sandwich arrives within 10 minutes of calling it in. If you order for pick up, your sandwich is made fresh in front of you. The quality is much better than subway, considering it's a chain restaurant. All of the employees are always so friendly and helpful. They also have people walking around the Rowan campus handing out samples of their different sandwiches. I would highly recommend eating here.
__label__5	Dr. Linhuber Anne-Marie was well worth the visit.  She was extremely nice, made sure I wasn't overcharged on any purchase, kept conversation to make it less awkward, and was overall comforting. The rest of the staff is just as welcoming and helpful.  I would love to keep her around as long as possible. Made my first visit less nerve racking.
__label__5	My favorite place to go to! LOVE the chicken tenders, cheese fries. But my all time, get every time is Baked potato soup, THE BEST!
__label__1	Extremely poor customer service. They make constant mistakes on their drive-through orders. And when you contact them to let them know through their online survey, you never get a response back. I would recommend avoiding this location at all costs.
__label__5	"Super awesome bartenders - Angie & Patty, friendly, fun customers & super cheap prices, continue to make this one of my favorite places.

When I say cheap, I mean seriously cheap. Thursday is ""can night"", where all domestic cans are $1.50 and they have a rotating list of $1 & $2 shots like Svedka flavors & Yukon Jack - all the time! 

I really don't know any other place that comes close to these kind of prices!"
__label__4	Iam new to sparks being from the bay area. Of oakland/ Sacramento it was nice to come across some home cook food. I loved it all. The only thing I was not meeting eye to eye was the mac&cheese was not to my liken. But the ribs and chicken and cornbread was on point. And they had really good customer service.  Next time I think I will try the greens or black eye peas.
__label__5	Their pizza is the perfect crust thickness and consistency. Try the buffalo chicken pizza!! Seriously the best pizza I've ever had.
__label__4	I've only been once, but Rosa Mezcal seemed like solid Mexican fare. The dinner menu is too pricey, but the lunch prices are reasonable and the food is good. The atmosphere and service are also both excellent. Presently the restaurant is BYOB, which is an opportunity to save money on drinks (at least for now). A solid pick.
__label__5	Have been going to this place for years - Andy and Greg are great at shining shoes - Odell does a bang-up job at repairs.  (My only gripe is that Won (the owner) won't take credit cards for payment!)
__label__3	"Monday night is the only time I would ever go for
Buy 1 get 1. Sushi isn't that great service is ok. Decor is nice and great location but definitely could Be better."
__label__1	Every once in a while I make the mistake of coming here because it is so close to my house and once I look and smell my clothes I absolutely regret it. I am almost convinced that this place takes your clothes, sprays it with Fabreeze and give it right back to you. I would absolutely not recommend this place for any work clothes. They may be slightly cheaper than other dry cleaners near by but there is a really clear reason why, because they are t really cleaning your clothes at all.
__label__5	Hands down the best fried chicken I have ever had. We tried Hattie B's and Prince's was better. It was SUPER spicy so order the light mild if you don't like very spicy food. I got the medium and it was still very spicy. It's definitely a hole in the wall but so good! We will go back when we visit Nashville.
__label__4	We had crispy polenta, roasted cauliflower and pizza. All was very good but be sure to order the polenta with side of sauce. The pizza was good and thin crust and the cauliflower was outstanding. Great atmosphere!
__label__4	"The Great: The mouth-watering Noble Burger, the illustrious bartenders, Christian and Theo, and the mixed drinks.

The Good:  Decor, Atmosphere, and craft beer selection.

The Bad: The downstairs bar can get a bit jammed up on busier days, Center City Sips, etc."
__label__4	Great value for happy hour -- wings were quite good and the truffle fries were tasty. Also had a great selection of wines.
__label__5	"Terrific experience. Great location, right off Bourbon St. Rooms are quiet & comfortable with modern touches (decent office chair, flat screen HD TV). Staff very proactive & service-minded.
Room service meals were outstanding quality.
I'll definitely stay here again."
__label__5	Sub 16 has the freshest subs and reasonable prices.  Lunch favorite for our office as well!
__label__5	Carnita Mexican Sandwhich is delish! Loaded with all kind of tasty goodies and grilled to add the perfect touch. Chips and salsa cooked to order and enough for 2-3 pp. Seriously great food in a quaint little fooler when you drive up.
__label__4	Whole Foods is close to my house and convenient for specialty ingredients that cannot be found at Trader Joe's. I prefer to buy our meat and fish at Whole Foods. After Amazon purchased Whole Foods some of our favorite items have become cheaper (ahi/salmon/almond milk). Their hot bar does not have as many options as other Whole Foods (ex: Oxnard) but it does the job if you need something pre-made for lunch.
__label__5	This is one of my favorite pizza places in town. They have delicious meat and cheese platers, a different selection of beer that pairs perfectly. And they cook it all in a brick oven. The service there has always been perfect, fast and friendly.
__label__5	Great food and service. We all love the spring rolls, the pho and the bun. The kids love the bubble tea. The drink selection is very good. My only problem is choosing what I want from the menu, it's all good.
__label__4	Good atmosphere... Oysters Rockefeller... My server was friendly and efficient... I will be back...
__label__2	I have always had a good experience at Moontown until today. Ordered carryout for my son's 19th birthday for pickup this evening.  Waited 20 minutes beyond the scheduled pickup time and they finally brought our four dinners with two 4-packs of beer. Cold food, cold fries, missing Cole slaw side,, one ketchup for two orders of fries, no utensils and napkins. Disappointed.
__label__1	Not a fan. Sadly, a wonderful oldie gone bad. Save your money and dine elsewhere. I grieve the loss of yet another great NOLA restaurant .  If you are an oyster newby you will probably enjoy it.  If you are a local- run away. Bad service, dirty and average food.
__label__5	Wow! I've just returned from Japan and this place made it feel like I was still there! Great ramen & gyoza.
__label__3	Service was great food not so good! Nothing really had flavor. 1st and last time I go
__label__5	Delicious flavors! This place is always clean and has nice people working behind the counter :)
__label__4	A friend recommended this place and I'm glad we went. Despite going early at lunch it wasn't fast. They seemed to be handling a lot of called in take away orders. I loved my chile rellano plate and horchata. Didn't eat the green sauce they put on the side; it was crazy hot!
__label__5	Great place, will be back for sure, staff is so friendly amd Caiti Escobar does a phenomenal job.........thank you
__label__2	We're here for a birthday party menu items looked good when I looked at the website before I got there but took an extremely long time to get the food I had fish, Walleye, witch was pretty tasty but it was almost cold when I got it and my brother-in-law had to take and send his steak back because it was overcooked and the orange roughy According to my mother-in-law did not taste good at all.
__label__5	Fun party bar! Ladies can dance on the bar with the coyotes! Great drink specials every day!
__label__4	So I decided it was time to give this place another try and I am very glad I did. New menu, improved service.  I will be back.
__label__5	Great happy hour prices for food. Sit at the bar! 4-7pm.  Definitely goi g back. Service wonderful. Comfortable place to be.
__label__5	This Wawa is a life saver. 24 hours plus gas. This is also a place where I have aways received service with a smile. Plus this is the first place where I've seen and participated in pay-it-forward. One act of kindness had a domino effect.
__label__5	"360 burger was so good! Our server was very friendly and attentive! I ordered ""the king"" and it was amazing! My boyfriend ordered the bayou bleu. Never in my life would I think to put shrimp on a burger. So delicious!!"
__label__4	If you are trying to explore foods and places like me, this is one of the places I would go. I like varieties. Been to some all-day breakfast but I find this quite interesting. I had the full Irish breakfast, loved their toasted Irish bread; heavy for just a slice. I like how they cook the potatoes, sausages kind of bland which I really love, alongside, they also have this beans which reminded me of home. Ambiance is like lay back and cozy. It's a nice place to have breakfast here.
__label__1	This location could care less about their guest. When I walked in, there was two servers playing barber shop. The host is walking around talking on the phone. And nobody was at the take out section. I had to walk to the bar to order. Another server is sitting in a booth just talking away. The service here is just altogether awful.
__label__4	Went here after the Clearwater aquarium. Not sure what to expect. Food and service were great.
__label__5	Saw Dr. Kusman for the first time today. He was incredibly knowledgeable and made me feel completely comfortable about my procedure. His staff was super friendly and helpful and was more than willing to accommodate my health needs. I really appreciated how Dr. Kusman spent so much time with me explaining the product and what I can expect. He really went into detail explaining how he works and had a delightful bedside manner. Neda was amazing and went above and beyond to set up my appointment and made sure all my needs were met. Definitely recommend!!!
__label__5	Great Pastries & Drinks. Peaceful Atmosphere. This place is definitely a Hidden Gem. Try it out for yourself and you will enjoy.
__label__5	Great Classic Candy Joint. It's become a familiar family tradition every summer to visit here.
__label__5	After walking around the Quarter all day we built up quite an appetite so we stopped at Coop's and I fell in love!!! I had the pasta (I believe it was the Cajun pasta). Not only did I love it but everyone I came with tried it and loved it too! Our waitress was so friendly and funny and the atmosphere was so relaxing and warm. I'll definitely come back and eat here next time I'm in NOLA!
__label__5	"This by far is the best pizza I have had since moving to Florida 4 years ago.  I've tried many others that are New York style but they don't compare to what I just had.  I ordered a 16"" pepperoni with extra cheese well done and garlic knots with meatballs in them.  It was cooked to perfection and the sauce is unbelievable.  The garlic knots with meatballs were an afterthought but man I'm glad I ordered those.  They were amazing and made want to try more of their extensive menu.  I hope to never move from this area because I just found my pizza spot."
__label__4	"It was dark and cold...the guy singing ""Brother Hash"" was awesome. We arrived earlier in the day and unfortunately he only played until 7pm. The drinks were not to shabby.  All in all we had a great time.

Next time I'm in town I'm definitely going back but I'll dress warmer..."
__label__2	I wish they had everything translated in English. It was really hard trying to figure out what I needed.
__label__2	"Merp!  Was excited to try this place out but was sorely disappointed.  We left hungry our W done burgers were Med/rare and super greasy. The ""candied jalapeño bacon"" they offer on the burger which is why i ordered it was literally just a slice of reg. Bacon and pickled jalapeños on top. The ice machine was out the entire time we were there. Really just not worth the hype and a waste of 47$ for 2 burgers, 1 fry and soft drinks. Also if your a covid conscious person don't go here!"
__label__5	"By far my most favorite knitting store ever!

I love the classes, knit alongs  and just the wonderful camaraderie of knitting enthusiasts!
I took a sock class and learned how to knit fireside socks and they are my go to project for quick gifts, everyone loves them, they are like a hug for your feet!  They knit up very easily using the magic loop technique.

I highly recommend The Tangled Web!"
__label__5	Stopped in yesterday (2-26-19) and was greeted by the young women offering samples (Lindsey). After trying a few samples she recommended the sassy Scotty (her favorite) on toasted wheat. She checked me out with a smile and brought my food quickly to my table. I'll make the drive back here because of her. I wish the Palm Harbor location had an employee like her. Great job Lindsey!
__label__1	This store is the worst. Not only are the employees unenthusiastic and seem tired constantly, they are not useful at all. I came to buy a woman's soccer cleats and they did not have a size 7 (women's AVERAGE size) in any of their cleats. The employees there were joking around with each other and seemed annoyed when I asked for help finding a shoe. I ended up buying a youth boys shoe. Also, it is expensive. I have never had a positive experience at this place, I suggest not going.
__label__1	Called just to make sure they were open at 9:50 on a Friday night... Was told the kitchen closes at 10 even though yelp, their website ect says 11. I hate that considering I came from Philly and just happened to call just before I got there..Will most likely never come back, even though it's pretty good, but no excuse for posting hours and then not sticking to them. In addition when I questioned the girl on the phone she treated me as though I was an idiot....guess next time I'll just go to kennett.
__label__5	My family took me to Bertucci's tonight for my Birthday and what a wonderful experience!!  John was our server and he did an EXCELLENT job of making us feel welcome as valued customers.  He is an asset to the restaurant and we will bring repeat customers, as I am sure all of his customers are.  The food and drinks were delicious as well!  Fantastic service, John and Bertucci's!!
__label__5	Had George (driver) an Ken as tour guide. Great people interesting tour and we enjoyed ourselves so much!!! Highly recommended oak valley and Whitney tour
__label__1	X monday I was so hungry orrder fry and cheeseburger . the fry where limp and cold right thought drive thought window . but I have not eaten all day. but the cheeseburger had so mhch mayo u could not eat without it dripping down your arm gross won,t be back
__label__1	poor customer service.   the cashier who helped me, was soo nice to the lady ahead of me ,who was white,  but when it came to my turn, not one word,   she had to double checked to see that the slippers i bot was on sale.   I am asian american, born and raised in america.   she had to force herself to say have a nice day.   what kind of people do they hire in target stores, anyway.    I 'm sick of being treated like i am a disease.
__label__4	A great place for a Po Boy and beer.  I had the half and half with shrimp and oysters.  Hand battered and very fresh.  Don't blink or you'll miss it.  It's in a neighborhood.  The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful.
__label__3	Think the food is good and always liked what we have ordered. However, we will not go back on the weekends due to wait time and wrong orders brought to table. The employees need to be better trained on working in a fast paced environment and I know they are trying. We always have excuses on being short staffed and cooks are backed up. We have better things to do than taking over 2 hours to complete our meal. Hope things get better soon.
__label__5	"December 27 2011 for lunch and January 10, 2012 for dinner.
Incredibly well trained staff. Beautiful setting. Attentive service, 5 star food. The bar area is nice. The well poured cocktails are expensive but worth it.

Lunch with a hard to impress19 year old. she loved it. Especially sitting next to the waterfall. Dinner with a fellow boomer. He and I loved it.

Try the edamame raviolis. Shockingly good."
__label__5	Awesome vibes at this breakfast spot. We came on a Monday and it was consistently busy so if you are coming on a weekend there could be a wait. Create your own hash ! Yummy! So much food and great tasting. Best part is that the staff is friendly and they were playing Reggae music. Super happy !
__label__3	Quick and tasty Mexican food.   If you want something light, ask for an MJ's special...yum!
__label__4	First of all Food is OK! But I liked their ambiance and the service we got around here. Yes the food is bit pricey, but you have a quite atmosphere and a better service than the bars around here. I would highly recommend to anyone for a weekday or weekend night out.
__label__5	We go here all the time and I constantly tell myself to write a review. Their food is really good, I love their pizza. Their pasta dishes are great, homemade ravioli that is stuffed with tons of cheese. The gelato at the end is a perfect way to finish out your experience here. Wonderful place! See ya next week!
__label__5	"I first became aware of Rau when I would take my foster Greyhounds there to get spade/neutered through Make Peace With Animals. They are nice enough to keep a running tab for these wonderful doggies. 

Now I take my new doggie Iris there and she seems to like it alright. 
I like everyone there. From the front desk people to the drs and nurses. They all seem to care a lot. And isn't that what it is all about?!"
__label__5	Lou did a great job painting my 2000 Monte Carlo. I was very happy with the work he did. I would definitely take my car back to him.
__label__5	I work in the cosmetic industry so having traditional braces wasn't an option. When I went to Dr Kassman's office they were plenty of other options. His staff made me feel welcome. They took the time to explain all of my options to me in detail. Can't say enough good things about them!
__label__2	The restaurant looks good, the food is not bad, I really like the kabobs, but the service was bad enough to me and my family never come back, I have a 3 years old boy,  I asked for a juice and they do not have appropriate cups for kids, they brought a disposable opened cup with no cover, my son unfortunately drop the full cup on the table, the waitresses pretended they didn't see it, We had to finish our dinner on a soaked table, we gave up desert off course, not a good experience!!!
__label__4	Drago is located inside the Hilton with access from the street and the hotel. When we arrived the one hostess asked how many in our party and another seated us without ever speaking a word to us not even to inform us who our server was. The server though nice seemed extremely scattered. Food was okay but the much raved about charbroiled oysters fell flat. It was soggy and the oysters were small. Other than that everything else was good.
__label__3	Archie's is a fun hang out spot, especially for those of us university folk! I do appreciate that they have a great happy hour with their house wines and tap beers being $2.  Couple that with a decent burger available 2-for-1 all day, everyday for students and you've got yourself a great hang out spot to grab a few drinks and a quick meal.
__label__1	Horrible horrible customer service. I walked in and everyone was on their phones and didn't even look up to welcome me. It was my first time there so that was an immediate turn off. The girl who did my nails did a half butt job and I had to ask her to grab my stuff to take over to the nail dryer. Absolutely the worst place and I will never be back.
__label__1	"Did I not tell you this place would be closed in no time????!!! 
ZERO customer service and very unprofessional and most of the time nobody was ever there and terrible waxing services snd did not even stand behind for their crappy services and they tried to tell me that I didn't show up for a redo appointment when they were always canceling on me!"
__label__5	Amazing food, and yummy bottomless drinks! Our fantastic and friendly waitress Morgan gave our brunch that special touch by carpeting to our special requests with no questions asked... Kudos to her for having the while menu memorized too- even the specials!! All in all great little must go to hidden gem in a NO neighborhood! I'm here for another week, and will most def be back!
__label__5	Another great Thanksgiving dinner there tonight. We had reservations at 5,and because the weather was so nice we decided to eat outside.  The service, the staff and the food was great as usual. Beautiful view of the Gulf as well.
__label__4	I crave the oyster soondubu. No kidding!! From the service, to atmosphere, to everything else we've eaten here, a definite must!
__label__5	I'm in Nashville with an afternoon to kill a fair amount, and I head to Mickeys to kill said afternoon more times than I'd like to admit.  Thing is, their happy hour (2 for 1 draft, etc) is SUCH a deal.  Pool table, foos ball, darts, and a great juke box, and its always the same perfect dark shade of 'dive bar' in there with a friendly bartender.  I don't know what you're after, but if the above describes it, I'll probably see you there.
__label__5	Wow. Just... wow. We ordered the garlic shrimp, crab legs, porterhouse steak, seared scallops... everything is delicious and cooked perfectly. Best steak, so tender and flavorful. Great margarita from scratch. Excellent service.
__label__5	"My husband and I absolutely love Irish Pubs!  We were so excited for Langton's to open.  The decor is excellent, food and drinks are great and the servers and bartenders are the best!!  We will be frequenting this pub often!!

Darla & Pete
Carmel, IN"
__label__5	Great pastries and coffee and atmosphere. Wish they would open a branch of this in my neighbohood...I'd be in bakery heaven
__label__3	Ok...after years of watching the battle between Pat's and Geno's on TV, and having my mouth water because I couldn't smell or taste their sandwiches, I've finally decided for myself.  And the winner is... BOTH!  It's just a matter of preference.  Geno's steak are sliced and Pat's are chopped up.  Both are delicious in my humble opinion.  (same review for Pat's as I did for Geno's).  However, if you ask my wife and kids, they say Pat's FO SHO!
__label__4	I have very thick hair and Paulina can tame it. I also have naturally curly hair. I wanted highlights and she gave me exactly what I wanted. Instead of combing my hair with a thin teeth comb she put tons of conditioner and used a wide tooth comb starting at the ends and working her way up to detangle t. I loved this. Every other salon I go to it feels as tho they are yanking my hair out. She also uses heat protectant so I don't loose my curls. I'll post my curls before and it straightened.
__label__1	Unfortunately Michelle, you were informed incorrectly; no one reached out to my husband nor myself!
__label__4	Love the food! Always hot & fresh. Absolutely OBSESSED with the Oreo milkshake. However, this location's drive thru is never fast. You will never be in line for less than 10 minutes
__label__4	"plenty of reviews here, so I'll just offer this suggestion - get the Special Hot Pot, on the back of the menu. When the waiter brings it over, take your time. Start slowly by picking off the top. When the bowl has calmed down a bit, then get your spoon under the perfect crust of rice at the bottom and pull it out. Eat that as a side dish to accompany the tastiness that previously trapped it. Perfect crusty rice is a work of art.

and you'll probably walk out with a shiny new calendar. sweet."
__label__4	This was a very cool bar recommended to me by a barista at Marchant's. Naturally I came on by once I finished my dinner and drink there. This place had a live country band which was very talented and I'm a fan
__label__4	Nice Sushi place. affordable but it will not fill your stomach. You need to order at least 2 items to fill your stomach. They renovated a bit. The food is really good and the presentation is even better. It is very close to my work place and so I stop by every now and then. I would recommend it if you like sushi. Nice patio. Overall a good place to dine.
__label__1	"The is the worst PF I've ever been to. We ordered chicken fried rice that was warm (not hot) and greasy. We also ordered the street noodles that was ok. The Egg drop soup was old and microwave. 

Btw this PF Chang don't use butter lettuce for the lettuce wraps, it makes for eating the lettuce wraps very messy. 

Please don't waste your hard earned money on the lack luster food."
__label__5	LOVED THE HOTEL. LOVED THE PEOPLE!! FRIENDLY AND SO SWEET. We checked in early and they couldn't have been more helpful with our bags and car. We will definitely be back! Thank you everyone for such a wonderful stay!
__label__2	Raman here is sub par , the broth lacks depth and richness .NOT a go to spot if you want a authentic bowl of ramen . If you like trendy decors and hip vibes come here .  But go else where for better ramen .
__label__1	We had the worst experience ever. I would recommend not even wasting time stopping at this place. Many other area restaurants that are so much more accommodating!!
__label__1	(I was originally going to rate higher but I got sick within hours of eating here) Friendly staff. Food was underwhelming. Some of the food was overcooked and some just slightly undercooked. Clam chowder was missing a contrasting flavor, ended up being slightly bland. This place is a huge miss, nothing positive to really say. Came here during lunchtime and they were having a huge employee meeting.
__label__5	It's a bit hidden but is so worth the search. The food is amazing!!! I highly recommend it. My favorites are the California Eggs Benedict and the Coconut French Toast. Yum!!!!
__label__5	Bollmeier Dental is unarguably the best dental clinic I have ever been to... We just moved to the area, and friends recommended them. The clinic is super nice, very clean, and the service was amazing... From the front desk manager (Mikayla) to the dental hygienist (Sheila) to Dr. Anne, my cleaning and checkup were outstanding.  Plus, they have massage chairs (which nearly put me to sleep). You can definitely tell they value their patients, and make a concerted effort to offer excellent care. Glad they were recommended to me
__label__2	"I ordered a Yazoo beer (Tennessee local) and a BBQ sandwich.
I got the beer but the BBQ sandwich never came--apparently because the waitress went on break. I guess she doesn't know how to tell someone that a table is waiting on a dish. I waited 45 minutes for the sandwich that never came so when the bill arrived, the BBQ sandwich was still on there and I had to get it adjusted.

On the bright side, I liked the live music and had to donate $1.
This is the only reason I came to this spot."
__label__1	horrible experience, horrible room. blood on bathroom floor, mold, water temp so hot, couldn't get to mild temp, window shade broken and had white power all over, ruined my clothes, floor filfthy, staff screwed up so bad on reservations. manager won't talk to guests to solve problems. horrible.
__label__1	"Went in to get my dog groomed.  I dropped him off and got a call soon after telling me that my dog is ""aggressive"" and need to he picked up immediately.  My dog is the most friendliest dog ever and has been to many groomers.  I have no idea what the groomer did to my dog, but he is far from aggressive.  I would never recommend anyone to bring their pets here.  I will gladly stick to Petco."
__label__2	"First the good: The service was very fast and friendly.  All the staff seems to care about your experience, more so then other places in ctown.
 
Now, as far as food goes it was average at best.  I've ordered Bibimbap which was very dry.  Half way through I couldn't even eat it anymore.  The seafood pancake was okay.  Nothing special about it.  My friends ordered various other dishes which also seemed average at best."
__label__5	Great shirts and other souvenirs. If you need something for the beach, this a good spot to get what you need.
__label__5	Awesome place and the best music.  Eat next door if possible great little Italian place.
__label__2	I got a fried Crawfish Poboy last night - it only came with the bun and Fried Crawfish, no lettuces or anything else... Didn't look like the other photos on here.
__label__3	Good chicken nuggets if you don't live close to a chick fil a I guess....I wasn't impressed and never returned after spending $30-$40 on chicken for 2 adults and a child.
__label__1	I ordered the prime rib and it seemed like i got  22 oz of pot roast.    The meat was dry and it had no characteristics of prime rib.    I wouldn't recommend any one to order the prime rib and also they forgot my rolls and put the creamy horseradish sauce i had ordered for my prime rib and put it as the dressing for my caesers salad.    Such a waste of 30 bucks for a national chain.    Im going local next time.
__label__2	"It's Starbucks so the coffee is what you would expect but,  seriously the agitation and craziness that ensues from the parking games played in that lot has made me leave several times. Then I park in the big lot and walk over to hothouse... 

The worst part is it's really the only Starbucks that serves Bryn Mawr, Haverford and Villanova.... tired college students + mainline clients = disaster"
__label__5	Great food and great service. Was pleased with the size of my pastrami sandwich which comes with fries. The place was full, but we were served fast. Check out this place and enjoy your meal!
__label__5	Fantastic local pizzeria!  Great flavors and quality.  Service was great, would highly recommend!
__label__2	If you LiKe DrinKing tHis is Your pLaCE the FOOD SUCKS, I ordered a PoRk TosTaDa,awful.  It had black beans on bottom of plate the tostada was SoGgy . It should of been call UpsiDe DowN SoggY TosTaDA. A tostada is suppose to be CrisPy. OveRaLL fooD wAs Bad. And of Course tHe tAblE wAs sticky  aS if It was Dirty , it was cleaned again , it was JuSt oLd. Enough said.
__label__5	My new favorite music venue in NOLA, not as high energy or steeped in tradition as most but focused on the music in a relaxed, comfortable, non-smoking setting.  The covers seem reasonable (I gladly paid $8 to see Jon Cleary), drink prices are decent, and you can get Taceaux Loceaux in-house.  Will certainly be back, definitely check out Jon Cleary on Mondays if you have a chance - good stuff.
__label__1	Order was an hour late. I ordered a side of chips and it's a bunch of crumbs that someone threw in the bottom of the bag. Workers are rude. It's a shame because with a little extra care and consideration for customers this place would actually be good.
__label__4	"I love this place - now as to why they aren't open at night (when I really want eat here and/or their profit margin would be incredible) BLOWS MY MIND!!!!  I know over a hundred dogs a year would be personally sold to yours truly...I stare at this empty dog truck often and ""dream of weenies"" on the reg."
__label__4	"Simple little place with a small menu.  Cash only.  

I tried the Bulgoki Beef which came with rice and bean sprouts.  Delicious and only $5.50.   

Simple, inexpensive, quick.  Will definitely be back."
__label__4	Great bbq. I love their mac and cheese,  as well as their other sides. The brisket is extremely tender,  and so is the pork. You also get free ice cream so that never hurts, lol.
__label__4	"Came to Nashville to ring in the New Year and stopped here to enjoy some Maryland Crab Dip and the Black and Bleu burger on a brioche bun. Both tasty treats and the service was excellent. 
Would visit again!"
__label__4	Best ramen in the area. I'm used to the quality of ramen in OC and LA and this is the closest thing to that in Goleta/SB in my opinion. Yummy salad and appetizers too!
__label__5	Love Ajia! She's smart, funny and beautiful and she does fantastic hair. A whole lot of gorgeous hair for not a lot of $$.
__label__5	How have I not written a review of Guero yet?!  I'll keep this short: The best sonoran dogs.  Order at the counter and they call your number. Tons of toppings, freshly made and kept clean.  Yum!
__label__5	We went in just browsing prior to our wedding and this was the first of many stops.  After the exceptional customer service provided by ALL of the staff (Lana, the manager, a greeter at the door) we ended up making all of our purchases with Jared of Reno.  What a wonderful experience, they stayed within our budget, didn't pressure us at all and really gave a wonderful impression over all.
__label__2	I don't know what to make of this place. It's like it's bipolar. Sometimes it's amazing, sometimes it's god awful. I don't know what's going on in the kitchen, but this place has huge potential being knocked down by inconsistent quality and too many things on the menu that are mediocre.
__label__5	Amazingly moist and flavorful cupcakes made with high-quality ingredients. Inventive, unique flavors like cocoa mole, mojito, almond pistachio rose....  Delightful (and super cute, too!). And, believe it or not, almost every Cup Quequito is 100% vegan. The lemon icing in particular is to die. Treat yourself to something special!
__label__5	I had the grilled reddish and was pleasantly happy with my choice! The creamy sauce they added wasn't too much but just enough to add a tad more flavor to the fish and bed of rice. i wanted some more veggies so I asked for grilled vegetables. If/when I'm back in NOLA, I'm coming back for this dish!
__label__5	Great place to grab breakfast, always full of people and very fun environment. Big portions too.
__label__2	The staff was great - very friendly and fast! The food...not so much. I ordered a chicken chimichanga and the chicken had zero flavor. I tried adding salsa and more queso but it wasn't good...at all. The rice tasted very bland, as well. My husband got a beef chimichanga and had the same experience - super bland. He didn't want to finish it. Very disappointed.
__label__1	Ordered takeout and asked for ranch on the side for my fries and onion rings. They told me they were unable to do that and my food was completely cold and soggy. Will never come here again. Would never suggest it to anyone.
__label__3	"It's not perfect, but it's a dive bar with cheap drinks and music. There was some live music the night I was there. The service was good and the drinks I ordered were decent. I live in the area and would probably go here again. It could use some more seating.

I look forward to them adding food to the menu."
__label__3	Pretty tasty, but you have to go early on in the day or they are pretty wiped out. Like that they have Paleo and Gluten Free options as well.
__label__5	Great food! Great price! We loved everything that we ordered! Waitress was attentive and everything was correct. Will definitely be stopping by more often!
__label__5	"Best hazelnut latte I've ever had.

Do the double shot.  You won't regret it.

Strong, delicious, not-bitter coffee.  A-freakin-mazing!"
__label__1	"7:45 PM, Tuesday night. Roughly 20 patrons in the bar area, and 4 people working. One male, three female. They all walk by us multiple times, never making eye contact. No greetings, no ""Hey we will be right with you.""  Nada. After about 10 minutes of being ignored, we just got up and left. I doubt they even noticed. And even though I just moved a few streets away, it is uncertain whether we will return."
__label__4	Got Kung Pao Chicken, Egg Rolls & Pork Fried Rice for takeout Sat. Night and it was fresh and delicious as always!
__label__2	"Epic Fail. The beef was not dipped.

Maybe they are accomodating a Florida clientele, but an Italian Beef should be dipped to the specification of the diner. Do not put a Chicago institution in another State and take away the Chicago.

Sorry, not dipping the beef is a cardinal sin.

Do NOT get off Interstate 75 to make a special trip here.

Chicagoans are UNIMPRESSED."
__label__2	No reservation but got an inside table. Very very slow service. Waitress was embarrassed it took so long.  Made excuses several times and owner stop by but didn't apologize. Sadly a nice place but not the most caring management. Food was a little overpriced for what we had.
__label__5	"Excellent service. Fantastic ice cream. Seriously impressed.

There's also a nice covered area outside that has three full sized tables, two baby tables, and two benches.

Very affordable prices. Best salted caramel pretzel I've ever had. Would highly recommend."
__label__5	Great place for healthy and natural food. Live the ambience.  Parking can be an issue , hope you fix it. Loved it!!
__label__1	Somehow my review disappeared from Yelp after a few days.  Its now been well over a month, and still no response from management about the problems we experienced.  So disappointing that they don't seem to care when there's a legitimate issue raised by a customer. Oh well, I'll just take my business somewhere that does care (and doesn't eat from the food as my meal is being prepared.
__label__3	"Came for lunch and was a little disappointed. Ordered our food. Went to fill our drinks only to be told the machine isn't working. Received our order only to have our order of fries ""not rung up"".  So $13.00 for a kids cheeseburger, kids fries, single burger."
__label__4	My first time here. My friend and I did some shopping on Memorial Day and were walking past and decided to stop in. We grabbed a couple seats at the bar and were prompty greeted. We ordered a bottle of rose and a pizza. The rose retails for around $15 and they charged over $40. Oh well, it was good. The pizza on the other hand was terrific. Looking at the dishes the other dinners were enjoying, I'd say they are at the top of their game. We will definitely stop back the next we are in the neighborhood.
__label__5	This is the swankiest place I think in all of Philadelphia.  This hotel is seriously decadent.  It's got a HUGE parlor downstairs with lots of nice furniture, a Steinway, and a garden with a fountain out back.  The staff is impeccably helpful and polite.  The rooms are sumptuous and pricey.  They also rent out space for weddings and stuff.  I certainly can't afford this place, but if you have the money and are from out of town, definitely stay here.
__label__1	Don't come here hungry.... bc the portions are so small and the menu doesn't describe it to be that small. I order the five apps to start than tried entree which had ten shrimp. Everything was so salty I never complain but I did bring up to manager who didn't try to save anything about my experience. I am from Nola visiting but this is the worse restaurant I have been to and will not be back.
__label__4	Good fast food burgers and fries. Cheese curds are not the best but they are good when you are craving them. Love their fries, crinkle cut and very crispy. They also have a good fish sandwich.
__label__2	"went for dinner with a friend last night,  i ordered zucchini  sticks and milano salad. 

the zucchini sticks were cut so thin all you tasted was breading.
i had always loved their milano salad but not last night, it was simply oiled lettuce

what happened????"
__label__5	One of the best hookah lounges I've ever been to. They have a wide assortment of brands of flavor including fumari, starbuzz, KM, and Pure. Also have Kaloud Lotuses and Ice hoses. They give you tongs so you can flip coals yourself for heat management. And they have outlets in each seating lounge so you can charge your phones. The service was really quick and they have very friendly staff. All around fantastic experience
__label__3	"My wife and I come here off and on when we getting need a quick pizza meal that's cheap.  Lately, I'll have to say the quality is not as good as it's been in the past.  The pizza has remained pretty good but the salad bar and ""pasta bar"" have gone down hill.  The pasta bar recently was pasta and sauce pre-mixed and sitting there getting clumpy and overcooked.  Previously they would supply two pastas and two sauces to choose from.  The salad bar has fewer selections and watery bowl of lettuce."
__label__5	Service was friendly, happy and personable. Relaxed casual atmosphere and great music... Food was very good, I had the fish tacos (twice in one trip) they were delicious. Plantains were good. I wish they were a little thinner but I can't complain. Watermelon juice (with a double shot of Tito's vodka of course) was what definitely drew me back.
__label__5	"Wanted to go to Cochan but stumbled on Butcher and  came back the next day for lunch.  Although it was a wait, the food was unbelievable and the wait staff extremely helpful.
We tried the  Muffaletta, cubano and brussel sprouts and couldn't have been happier.  Everything was delicious and the proportions huge!  We plan to go back for sure.  The guests in front of us had returned there everyday of their trip.  Who could blame them!"
__label__5	Even the cauliflower was great. Of course the garlic knots. We didn't even have room for the pizza
__label__5	I love this place! The food is always fresh and very tasty. There is always a short wait to get a table, but any good restaurant will.
__label__2	"Beer is subpar. The food is not good. The chicken sandwich I got was slightly worse then something I'd get from Culver's or Wendy's. My wife's burger was not good either. She ate half of it and had enough. 

This place needs a ton of work. Would not recommend at all."
__label__4	This is a new type of food to me, Troyes their desserts and food! They were okay, not very surprising, but good to try something new
__label__5	Very friendly place and food is delicious I had the Flautas plate my husband had the fajitas beef n chicken very large portion of food very good.  Will will be coming back next time we visit Reno.
__label__1	God I hate having to go to the mall.  Any mall.  Alas, I needed new jeans and this place was close.
__label__3	"I stopped by the other day for a beer and an appetizer. The nachos were just average. I tried a couple of different brews which were interesting. 

Although this place is much closer to me than the Tap Room location, I prefer the intimacy of the Tap Room. Bottleworks is a bit corporate feeling to me. Just my preference."
__label__2	This place used to have great Lemon Poppy seed old fashioned donuts.  But they switched from a lemon batter to a crappy flavored glaze.   Their chocolate icing has very little coco in it even compared to grocery store donuts.   At this point local grocery store donuts are tastier and cheaper and I will stop going to Rounds for donuts.   Their bagel sandwiches are good but about $2 bucks higher than Einstein's .
__label__5	Such a great place to go and indulge in some great conversation. So exclusive, and such a quaint spot to get cozy. Their menu items are so different than anything you've tasted before, one of my recent favorites was duck wings and it was delicious. Their drinks are incredibly creative and very tasty to make your way through the options
__label__3	food was amazing, but they were out of red beans and rice. The staff was nice and fun, a bit of wait but the rabbit sausage jambalaya was worth it!
__label__5	My husband and I were just in Nashville about a week ago. We planned to take the Nelson's Green Brier Tour but they sell out very quickly. We still went in for a visit and did a tasting. The staff was very nice and the location is large and accommodating for big groups of people. Our tasting leader was Austin. He was very knowledgeable and added in some witty jokes to keep the mood light and fun.
__label__5	went to Blue Oak on 4th of July and the line was out the door and down the street. we entered through the side door and sat at the bar. We had 2-meat plate with ribs and chicken which was excellent and our sides were slaw and the beans. Sides were ok, but didn't have the WOW factor that meat did. Caitlin the bartender is out of this work. it was very busy and she remained calm and efficient and handled all requests. if you sit at the bar, she can place your food order so no standing on  line.
__label__1	"Managers here are absolutely stupid. They are having radiology technicians also do the lab work. How do I know this? Well because multiple employees apologized for the 2 hour wait I had to endure because ""we don't have lab, we only have a radiology tech do multiple jobs here because management wanted to save money."" So hey, thanks stupid managers in this center! Way to think about how patients are cared for!"
__label__4	"One of my favorite sushi place in Philly. If you're looking for affordable BYOB, this is the place to go.

For the roll, we always ordered the spicy yellowtail and scallop. From the kitchen, the cod dish is a must try.

The best part is that this place is BYOB, which means you can enjoy your sushi, have a couple drinks and it won't break the bank."
__label__5	"Their Captain Crunch roll is always my go to. Lovely environment.. for lunch especially. Great customer service. I always feel that the staff is attentive and ready if I have a request. 

I've also ordered take out before and it was delicious!!"
__label__5	These guys are the best. Diligent and friendly, they took great care in fixing my grandfather's watch.
__label__4	Great tasting food and great price, just wish the cashier would wash her hands between handling money and touching food containers and cups etc. She has no regard for cross contamination
__label__5	"I love this spot.  Everyone is friendly and helpful and the baked goods are to die for.   I can't wait for the next big snow storm so I can sit in this cozy cafe and enjoy the delicious sweets while peering out the window. 

Plenty of off street parking in front of the store and on the side streets."
__label__4	Their pan seared scallops are fantastic! You should try them. The customer service depends on a person who is serving you,
__label__5	We had a fabulous dining experience here!  To start the staff was so accommodating with our party of 16. The wait staff was friendly, helpful and a lot of fun. The food was perfectly prepared and very interesting!  We loved our experience here! The wine list has plenty of options but we took the servers recommendation and her has excellent taste!
__label__3	"Seeing the 4.5 stars I expected a lot more then we got. 

The diner is small and it smelled like an old houses basement. Very musty. The fly that buzzed around the small diner was annoying too. 

The eggplant parm was so-so as was the eggs Benedict. Nothing earth shattering. Food was reasonably priced. We probably just ordered the wrong thing."
__label__5	Their Sunday brunch is delicious. Highly recommend the avocado toast and a bloody mary! The service is quick and everyone is so polite. It's small but very cozy. I would recommend making a reservation.
__label__3	Great service unfortunately the food was not great the meat taste cheap we only ate 3 tacos out of 5 and we were still hungry , the chilaquiles were good the price is cheap but I will rather pay more if the door was better.
__label__1	"Awful Service center here.  We unfortunately bought the lifetime oil change plan on our new vehicle from here and even with an appointment an oil change sometimes takes 2+ hours.  This is something that should take 15-30 minutes at most.  I get the feeling that ""lifetime oil change"" to this service department means  ""put this customer as last priority""."
__label__5	"Let me preface this by saying I am NOT a Starbucks gal. I'm straight up picky with coffee because my husband makes the greatest cup ever. 

The vibe and decor of this spot is AWESOME and I'm totally hearing back to buy myself a cool mug to take home. 

Now the coffee..... it is SO. GOOD. I had two different iced lattes in as many days and they were both perfect. Not overly sweetened, beautiful balance of taste. Nice baristas. This is a great spot!"
__label__4	Very fun, laid back atmosphere... Great for watching games... At night it turns into a poppin' bar with a DJ.. Always a good time here... Awesome selection of beer on tap and extensive menu for a sports bar. Good stuff...only reason I didn't give 5 stars is sometimes too loud to have a conversation without yelling but hey I guess that's what you get at a bar.. Also self-sitting no matter what time you go but than be a good or bad thing depending but otherwise this is an awesome place!
__label__1	They will screw you over. They tried to charge over double for my rental. They tried to charge me an extra day for ONE hour. They did get me for an upgrade I did not request. They act like that's the car you're receiving but it's a sneaky upgrade they'll charge whatever. I'm not going back. I recommend no one else should either. Smug and slow service, will try to charge you double.
__label__5	The butterscotch moonshine is to die for.  I got the Peach which wad good; however, the wife had the butterscotch and it was awesome.
__label__1	"Used to be regulars here. On a Sunday night at 7:30, a hostess who was visibly annoyed to see us turned us away at the door with a short ""we're closed."" Walked away with no explanation. Over half the tables were filled inside..."
__label__1	Went here again and everything was even worse. Worse service, somehow worse food (it's possible, apparently), and worse clientele (though the single star isn't for that, to be fair). This place should be in a strip mall in Cherry Hill.
__label__4	Very cool divey joint.  Can see why it's a local fave.  Everyone is really nice.  Greg was the bartender.  Native to New Orleans and full of wonderful stories.  Pours a nice stiff drink.  The famous Bloody Mary was nice and spicy with pickled green beans and olives.  Everyone in the bar was friendly and struck up conversation.  We even ordered take out and had it delivered at the bar.  Fun times.
__label__5	Shooters world is my go to shooting range and gun store I love this place to death they have the best prices for guns ammunition and accessories and if you speak with CJ he will always give you the best deal he can I have got it on multiple occasions and I can't tell you the great customer service this guy offers I know it sounds like I'm blowing smoke up your butt but im not this guy is awesome there are a few other people in there that our great customer service and sales associates but I feel that CJ is a step up above the rest he knows his stuff
__label__5	A hidden gem!  Fantastic beers and food served on an outdoor patio that is beautifully landscaped so you don't even know you're in the city!
__label__5	I love this place! I have ordered delivery lunch to my work (I'm a teacher) at least 3 times. I am hooked on their bowls... the Mexican and the Indian are super good! It's affordable and a ton of food! Don't hesitate! Go! Make that easy online order right here on Yelp!
__label__3	Stopped in for a berverage in lieu of paying $3 at the hotel vending machine. I found the mart to be well stocked and reasonably priced. It is well lit and open 24 hours.
__label__5	About the best place in Meridian to take a client or meet some for lunch.  Nothing is bad on their menu, nothing.  I return at least once every other week.
__label__3	It's a decent place to hit when your in a pinch for a six pack , but be prepared to pay up for it
__label__5	The best dry cleaner! Very Friendly.....Judy is there greatest!
__label__1	Horrible place to go very slow and terrible quality! This Sonic is an absolute disgrace to Land O Lakes/Lutz area. We literally ordered 4 mini sonic blasts and it took 25 min to get the items.  Our blasts barely had any candy inside it at all and was very bland. I would rather eat dog crap than eat at this place! Absolute disgrace!!!
__label__5	really good service, really good food and service was perfect. I had no issues with my food or wait time. Server was willing to help me pick what would be best
__label__3	After reading the other reviews we decided to give this deli a try.  My wife ordered the meatball sub and I had the pastrami sandwich on rye.  With drinks and 1 bag of chips the cost came to $19.  I felt this place is overrated by others.  My sandwich was a bit fatty and quite small.  My wife's was not very flavorful.  The atmosphere was nothing to enjoy.  It was noisy and we were the only ones there.  (Music was loud and annoying.)
__label__3	Just be warned if you are under the age of 18 during the weekdays after a certain time, You cannot access the arcade.
__label__4	Came here on the friday night seafood and steak buffet. Overall food quality was good. All the seafood was good and cooked correctly. They had so much variety that it was good. Their oysters are good and fresh. They kept the station stocked.
__label__5	I placed an order from Los Angeles California a little iffy since it's not a known store in Los Angeles and what would you know within 3 day the order was in my front steps wow! Amazing I was definitely keep shopping from you guys!!!
__label__3	"The item here is the mac n' cheese. It's really a cross between mac n cheese and hamburger helper with that being said it is delicious. The jalapeno cheddar cornbread is tasty and it's a nice portion. I recommend having it with the honey butter that they have. 
Super cool after the party spot."
__label__2	We love Steak n Shake, but this location is awful.  The first booth they tried to seat us in today had so much grease on the floor, I slipped in it.  The next booth worked, but the floors are absolutely filthy in this location.  Service tends to be slow.  I know it's a price freeze, but I guess to make sure they didn't lose money, the burgers are now much smaller, and the fries are much smaller orders as well.  What a disappointment.
__label__1	This place is awful. I have food poisoning I am totally disappointed with this place. I thought it was better than that but I've been throwing up all night and I'm never going back again don't stop here unless you like throwing up 7 times in 20 minutes. I prefer rain sushi which is in Tyrone
__label__5	Been coming here since I was a child and love it very much there's different stores to either eat or purchase items at and such a good environment
__label__1	I'm giving this place one star for cleanliness and fast refills on our waters.  Ordered the ybor cuban sandwich and it had to be the worst Cuban sandwich i've ever had. It was made from cold cut deli meats, and was not good. Also ordered the turkey club which was fresh with juicy tomatoes but asked for wheat bread but got it on white bread. The only thing this place has going for it is that it's in the airport. The staff was friendly but I've had better food at my high school cafeteria.
__label__3	"My significant other and I went to eat dinner here. The food was delicious and so were the drinks.

Our waitress Layla though for reason only talked to my significant other and overtly flirted through out the entire dinner. She never looked my way and directed all interaction at him. It was odd to say the least."
__label__3	Finally!  Free wi-fi!!!  They need more seats, though. The ladies' restroom is disgusting.
__label__1	Very long waiting and food is super slow. Very disappointed as our first meal in Tucson! Won't recommend it.
__label__4	On a best friend's weekend and we popped in for breakfast/brunch.  We decided just to grab some open spots at the bar (they serve the full menu).  The bartendress was super nice and very friendly and prompt with service.  We both ordered mimosas which were created from bubbly they have on tap!  Totally reccomend the french toast, delicious and not overwhelming.  Really enjoyed the people and food.  Oh and they have all these beautiful chandliers (also for sale) but make for pretty things to look at.
__label__5	I love this place. The bowls are delicious, fresh and the owners are such friendly people.
__label__5	Delicious place in NOLA! The cheese grits are my fav!! The southern breakfast was delicious
__label__5	These guys are wonderful and the only dry cleaners I will use in Philadelphia. I dropped off two suits, one with a severely stained silk shirt that I thought was finished. The suits were cleaned beautifully, on time, and to my surprise, they had gotten the stain completely out of my expensive shirt. They also do tailoring (just fyi) and did a beautiful job on that too (I had my suit pants made smaller and they now fit perfectly). I bring all my dry cleaning to them, and would trust them with my most expensive clothes.
__label__5	"Jeni's is incredible. I've said it before I'll say it again, I don't even love ice cream and I loooove Jeni's. 

My first time at this location. But not my first jeni's visit. 

As always great flavor choices, great taste and texture. Such quality staff! 

Keep up the awesomeness!"
__label__1	"Went in on a Tuesday night found a piece of hair in my buffalo fries waiter took it back but returned with ""new"" buffalo fries in like 2 mins. I'm assuming they just put more French fries in the same basket. Had to go up to the counter to get napkins and to also get our check. Poor service and very disappointing. Server checked on us maybe twice."
__label__5	This place is the best! My stylist was Emily, and she was so kind and did such an amazing job. I have really thick, long hair and she took her time and made sure that everything looked great. This is by far the best salon in Tucson, and I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone.
__label__5	I had a very pleasant experience with this company from the moment I called them to schedule a consultation. They were thorough and reliable, made sure I understood every board of the project and were aviailable and knowledgeable whenever I had questions. The workers that cake to do the work over the span of two days were friendly and thorough and even made sure to sweep up after themselves. I would definitely recommend Allied for your home's needs.
__label__5	"Tonight was our first time.  What a great place!  We were wondering why it was always crowded, and now we know.

First off, we were greeted at the door by two friendly employees.

We were seated and quickly greeted by our server, who was friendly and helpful.  

The food was so fresh and amazing!  While we were dining, Jeremy came up and he was great!  He was genuinely interested in our dining experience.

We will be back!!!"
__label__1	The new owners won't answer my calls or emails about money that is owed on our deposit. Come on guys I was rooting for you. We were all rooting for you.
__label__4	"The past few times I've been here the quality of the food has changed a little bit....I've raved so much about this place to friends and family that it's quite a bit embarrassing when they come to town. The pork is bland and the egg cake is dry and old. Both times, quiet a bit disappointing. It's very difficult to find a 5 star amazing Vietnamese restaurant in the area. I will come back and try again. Perhaps I visited them on their ""off"" days. If anything changes I will update again!"
__label__5	"Try this restaurant. Everything is awesome! Chips and salsa to start. Margas. Enchiladas. Cheese quesadilla. Carne Secca (spelling?) get anything and everything with this!!!

I've never gone to a brand new restaurant for lunch and waited an hour. Especially after arriving at 11:20am! It was worth it!!!!! We have been coming to Tucson for 10 years and never knew about this gem. Highly recommend. You will have to wait but it's worth it!!"
__label__5	Always a hit. Food is fresh and delicious every time. Vegetarian friendly. Beautiful ambiance and decor. Lovely for a date night or bringing out of state visitors to showcase beautiful midtown reno!
__label__1	"We moved in in July and are already looking to move when our lease is up. When we first moved in the apartment didn't even look like someone cleaned it. There was mold in the bath tub, dog food from the previous tenant, stains on the cabinets, and etc. 
The undercover parking is across the apartment complex and no one seems to know how to fix anything or have answers. 
I would just say be careful in signing the lease. They show you a model that doesn't look like what your getting. Look at the actual apartment that you are leasing. The only positive is it's quiet."
__label__5	Great place for good food. The staff goes out of their way to make everyone feel like part of the family
__label__1	Well, despite their warning that operations may be affected during the COVID-19 pandemic, I ordered on the phone. It took an hour to get the food. Never again.
__label__3	The scoop of ice cream I had was good, but it wasn't special enough to cost over $5.  I stopped in on a beautiful, warm Friday afternoon and the place was deserted - I almost walked away because I thought it was closed.  It also looked like it could use some cleaning.  As I stated, the ice cream was good, but not that good.
__label__4	The staff was extremely nice, the service superb and fast!  Was visiting and got a bit sick of all the fried foods.  I'm Vietnamese so pho is always a staple and nice to have as an option when you're dehydrated from non stop adult beverages!  Went here with the husband and friend.  The pho was good and I also enjoyed the Vietnamese coffee. The atmosphere is super cute.
__label__3	The food was good but the servers were less than attentive. Our server was so busy hanging on another customer that she didn't realize until our request for our tan that we had never received our appetizer. There was no point on telling her when she quickly set our main dishes down on the table so we chose not to say anything until were ready to leave. Was only fun because of the person I was with...
__label__2	For a high end steak restaurant,  the service was poor and our steak was overcooked.  We had dinner reservations for 4 at 8:30 pm on a Saturday and got seated at 8:50 pm.  Then,  the wait was so long at our table,  that we didn't get served our entrees until 10:30 pm.  For this level steak house,  there are so many other better options in the city.  I would recommend another choice.
__label__5	This place is the best. My dog has extreme separation anxiety but she is always running into day care and is happy upon pickup. They also do a great job of doing fun events/posting photos which the people love. Also obsessed with the halloween costume contest and photos with santa!
__label__4	Fabulous breakfast!  Fresh, cooked to perfection and service was exceptional!  Chevon is one of the best servers I've encountered in quite some time, and I travel a lot!
__label__5	Wow. Bit into my falafel pita and it's super yum!! Owner is very nice, they have a great variety of foods and beverages (international too!), prices are very reasonable. This is a fantastic find.
__label__2	"Ate here a few weeks ago and only one employee was wearing a mask and he worked in the kitchen. Additionally, the manager even came up to our table with no mask. 

Decided to give it another try since the mask mandate came out and again employees were not wearing masks. A few that did have masks had them pulled below their chin.

The description also says they wear gloves, which also definitely was not happening."
__label__1	The building was beautiful and attracted us there. It turned out to be all facade and no substance. The food was second rate at best. And very expensive. We will not return.
__label__1	This place used to be my go to breakfast place but today visit was so disappointing. Coffee was so watered down, potatoes that came with every dish were dried up/burnt, a piece of hair found on the bottom of another plate , they got my son's Wilbur Skillet order wrong 3 times!!! He ended up getting his order when all of us were finishing up our meals. The manager took it off the bill but the fact that the every plate had something wrong was very disappointing. I won't be coming back.
__label__4	So slow.... If you are in a hurry I recommend going somewhere else. I thought because I was the only person in the lobby and the fact that 6+ employees were there it would be quicker today. But if you have time to wait it is worth it.
__label__4	I had Sunday brunch which consists of a buffet. As far as buffets go it was pretty good, there was lots of options and you can grab as many plates as you like. The service was also excellent as they were attentive and made sure your needs were taken care of.
__label__5	Love the new venue!! Everybody was super friendly and professional. Definitely coming back for more awesome shows!!
__label__1	Do not get adt unless you are willing to enter a long contract and even if there's a once In a 100 year pandemic and you've been a customer for 12 years you still have to pay a 75 percent cancellation fee to cancel. ADT is similar to the thieves they protect you against, they just use small writing in contracts instead of crowbars .
__label__5	Most of the menu items are authentic renderings of classic dishes and a few are innovative interpretations. But all of them are expertly prepared.  Very friendly and accommodating staff too.
__label__3	I went to the union for the time and am sad to say I was a bit disappointed with the food. I had the Shrimp Oscar flatbread which was ok it was quite salty. I may return and try something else just because of the great things I heard about them before but not soon. The staff and service was great and friendly and the space itself is very nice
__label__4	The food was very good and the staff was friendly enough.  We had a seared tuna wrap and the ginger sauce made it over the top.  I wish the menu was easier to read, they have it on the glass in front of you and it's hard to make out the words on clear glass.  I prefer my fries a little crispier but the taste was good and the sauces they gave us were great with the fries.  We will be back anytime we are in Santa Barbara.
__label__5	"This is actually my new favorite of all the Arni's I've been to. The last few times I've gone to the old original Arni's in Lafayette, they're just not the same. The pizza doesn't come out as good or look as appetizing.

The pizza at this Arni's was phenomenal and just like I remembered Arni's should be. The joint actually looked a little classy and the service was decent. And can I say anything more about the wonderful greasiness that is an Arni's pepperoni pizza??"
__label__4	This place was so darling! Really good food too! Garlic bread was... Amazing, had good soup, fajitas, and French onion soup as well. I probably won't be back because it was just by accident I was in Pennsylvania???! But you should try it!!
__label__5	This place is absolutely AMAZING. I was craving pizza, but I didn't want the reg (Pizza Hut, Papa Johns, etc). Luckily I found this place on maps and I'm in loooovvvve. It's cheap ($5 for a personal pizza), the staff is SUPER nice, and it was done quickly.  I would definitely recommend this place for anyone wanting awesome pizza quickly.  It's also family owned so that's always a plus
__label__5	Girls night dinner. Our server, Gabriel, was fabulous. He was attentive but never interrupted our catch up time.  Started with lovely local cheeses. Various starters were delicious with the  squash being a standout. The entrees were all wonderful with the beef cheeks and grouper being standouts. We will definitely all be back. I want to try the chicken next time!
__label__3	The food is not as fresh as it used to be. Seems like the quality is going down. Thr sushi choices are very limited.
__label__4	I love this place.  The margaritas are good, particularly if you order top shelf, and the cheese dip is way above average.  The patio and the service really set this place a notch above the competition.  The service is prompt, they actually remember and greet even semi-regulars warmly, and they are always accommodating and attentive.  We recently visited here with a group of seven girls and everyone left more than happy.  They deserve tons of credit for a consistently good experience.
__label__4	I've eaten here a couple of times. It's definitely gotten better. I had the soft shell crab special and it was amazing. I hope when I go back it will be just as good... Maybe even better.
__label__5	Their food is amazing. Wonderful service and extremely quick time between ordering and receiving your food. My entire team at work orders here constantly. This is the best BBQ in the tristate area!
__label__1	"This one star goes to the pictures of the Huevos Rancheros I have seen. A plain omelette with canned enchilada sauce is not ""Huevos Rancheros."""
__label__2	"2.5 Stars

Don't get me wrong, the BBQ was great, but the cleanliness of this location was unappetizing.  I have had catered Whitt's barbecue at various events at school, and it was great, but I'm not sure if I'd want to eat in here again."
__label__1	A year later and the drive thru is still ridiculously slow. Why can't they fix this? It's not fast food. It's so slow.  Really?
__label__4	"I love Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch, I don't know why I didn't write a review for this place when I was here for graduate school. I always get the 1/4 chicken plate with extra chips which go very well with the delicious salsa available at the Salsa bar. The meat is just smokey enough and very tasty. Simple restaurant where you pay at the register and they bring you the food. Wet naps are available to clean up but sometimes they are dried out.

The only real negative that I found is that the chips are not my favorite. A bit dry in my opinion."
__label__1	"Employees are disrespectful and act like they aren't listening and take forever to respond. Asked how many ounces the medium was compared to how many ounces the large was and someone named Barbra yelled back ""the large is bigger than the medium"" in a condescending tone. Repeated the question multiple times and every time it was ignored or answered rudely. Drove away."
__label__4	Pubhouse burger is a glorious concoction of A1 flavored beef, bacon, fried, onions. Full of fabulous flavors that are only enhanced by the  beer selection that is made to satisfy the palate of even the most sophisticated beer drinking burger eating connoisseurs.
__label__4	The best blueberry scones in the entire world! The muffins are awesome. Excellent breakfast but can be a little pricey depending on what you're used to....just go check it out. YUM!
__label__2	A relative referred me to this place. I will not go back. The food isn't good or the drinks. Staff was okay. I will not go back and you pay Valet parking. This is not a place for me. I went here on my birthday
__label__5	Would literally move to Nashville for their iced dirty chai with oat milk (also got the breakfast burrito which was pretty good too)
__label__2	Arguably the worst service I've ever had. The waitress couldn't have been more rude if she'd tried and left my group feeling uncomfortable. The food was good but sadly not good enough to make up for the awful service
__label__1	The staff moves extremely slow. There's no way I should be in here for 10 minutes almost late for work. They need to do better.
__label__4	Smokey and dusty were great crew.  Smokey took the time to help my son catch more fish.   The half day trip is well worth the money.
__label__3	"This place is one the many pretty good thai spots in St. Louis. I would leave it at pretty good. Service and food are fine. Price is ok. 

If you are downtown and want to stay downtown this is a good option. lots of close meter parking, but i would say head to Grand if you are looking for the next level."
__label__5	Boutique MMM is always my first stop when I visit Franklin TN. The shoe boutique is exactly what a shoe store should be! The owner is so knowledgeable and has filled the store with so many brands and styles that are exceptional in style and quality!
__label__5	White chicken (medium heat), mac n cheese and lemonade was amazing! Line wrapped around the place but was worth the wait (moved at a decent rate). The only thing I didn't like were the greens yuk. Would totally recommend this place to anyone:)
__label__2	I used to love La Parilla until I realized the food sucks, the service can't keep up the with crowd and I'm tired of wasting my money. Harsh? Yes. I have been eating here for years and once they started to get busier everything went down hill. No me gusta. It's just not worth it, even for that big melted cheese appetizer. Too many bad experiences, not gonna waste my time man.  Go eat in South Tucson instead.
__label__4	You can really taste the corn syrup in the sprite. Not that much of a variety when it comes to desert. It took about 15 minutes for food to get here, popcorn shrimp is good. Fries are alright and the bake potato was ok.
__label__4	Been on the hunt for a great breakfast sandwich but these were overpriced and underwhelming. Ordered the bacon egg and cheese sandwich and was really disappointed. I'd honestly rather order this sandwich from Dunkin. Really wanted to like this place. Coffee is good and the vibes are nice.
__label__1	"The only thing I like about this place, and I have eaten there three times, is the pizza. It reminds me of the pizza in my country of origin, Argentina. 
The cocktails are below average mixology-wise, the staff on the pizza side are generally professional, but the staff at the alcohol bar are incredibly ride and got worse each time I returned. I won't bother anymore."
__label__2	On the positive side, Coronet's food is tasty, and the staff is friendly. On the downside, their prices are fairly high when compared to other similar places... and the portions are small for a pasta restaurant.
__label__5	Best blta sandwich I have ever had the bacon here is amazing. Wait staff was super nice and food was out quick
__label__5	"I loved this little hidden place. When we pulled in we thought it was actually closed. 10am on a Sunday and we were some of the only people there! 
Being able to watch them make the pastries and bread was an amazement for our 3 year old.

The breakfast was DELICIOUS! So much so that as I write this I think I may want to swing by this place again!"
__label__3	It is too busy at this location, especially around rush hour. 309 in general is busier around colmar and lansdale. I usually stop in at a Wawa further down the road. The other wawa in hatfield is always so quick to make my coffee. This Colmar wawa usually is not.
__label__5	I had the Bun with shrimp, crab and snail and the shrimp egg rolls. Sublime flavors, fresh and local food sources. Perfect meal.
__label__5	The new kid on the block in Downtown Saint Pete. Offers continually rotating craft beer menu for bottles and draft as well as specialty craft cocktails (I prefer the Hopped Sazerac). They have great nightly specials, and true to the name offer yards of ale! They tore down part of the old building when they took over and created a unique outside patio that has a Chicago-feel to it. Definitely a lot to do with frequent local bands, dj's, Thursday Trivia night, corn-hole, giant jenga and really just a great/fun environment. Definitely worth checking it out!
__label__5	Amazing results. If you ever run into any issues give Jeff a call and he will resolve any issue.
__label__2	Meh. Everything was ok. Nothing g exciting here. Too many good places to eat in tampa to make a second trip.
__label__5	Great price, good food, really good service. Was just surprised that we were allowed to serve ourselves from the food bars and no one was required to wear masks while serving their own food. It didn't bother me at all but with the current mandates from our Nazi mayor, most food bar style places are having employees serve the food to you at the bar. It's nice to see a place standing up to the worthless mayor of Nashville.
__label__2	"Set in an old mansion which is cool but it looked tired to me. Also was very loud. Very limited menu and on the expensive side. The jerk fish came as two very small medallions on top of zucchini noddles. The portion was so small. I am a 5'2"" small lady and I left hungry and the entree was $27. Two drinks and one entree was $55. Won't be back. There are too many better places for that price."
__label__5	Off the chain rack! This place was yummy and legit. Nice inside too..its a little duck off spot to just relax for a little bit.
__label__3	"Came here super late one night after going out and having fun. This place is open 24 hours and going in so late with a large group, it's prettty much like any other diner around. The food is exactly what you would expect from a diner. It's a little old inside but I don't expect a diner to be new and very well kept anyways. 

Service is what it's expected. Nothing spectacular. Food was ok, not great or anything either. I would probably prefer another chain restaurant diner before I come back here though."
__label__5	This place was absolutely amazing. We were visiting from Sarasota Florida and we so excited when we stumbled upon this place. The food is great. The guacamole was fantastic. The tacos were delicious and the margaritas were unbelievable. We will be back.
__label__4	I have to admit I only go for pizza. But it is the best pizza around. Have only eaten in restaurant 2 times, meals good both times. A little dark and dated inside. But again pizza great.
__label__3	Everything is passable here but avoid the drinks. Which taste like powder and artificial food coloring. As the other reviewers mentioned their food really lack flavor.  The prices here are fair and portion size is decent.
__label__5	This little local hole in the wall has amazing food, amazing service and a friendly atmosphere. The 3 meat combo is the best deal, you can try a little of everything. The mac and cheese was to die for. The chicken was one of the best thing we have had yet in New Orleans! IF you are craving BBQ in NOLA, the Joint is the place to go!
__label__3	Cool spot.  Good beer selection and also nice gin selection.  Excellent bar food. Wings highly recommended very filling
__label__5	I am so glad we stumbled upon this lovely gem in such a lovely neighborhood.  From the moment they sat us down in front of the window I knew it would be great.  Our appetizers were so good. Bruschetta with roasted red peppers, olives and the most succulent burrata was excellent as was the goat cheese and beet salad.  Entrees followed and were just the right size.  One with wild boar and one with grilled octopus (my all time favorite).  We will be back -- very nice evening.
__label__5	"This place was stellar. We stopped here on our way out of town with my family and they had a DJ spinning records in the corner and they were REALLY good. I wish I got their name.

Anyway, the low point of the meal was the fired deviled eggs where were bland. I have a very high bar for them, but sheesh. 

Beyond that the food was great, the atmosphere was vibrant, the staff was attentive, and the coffee was solid. 

Do yourself a favor and get the truffle fries."
__label__5	"I just had the most marvelous experience one could possibly imagine-- at Guldner's Collision Service. I had ripped my Front bumper while driving in the Catskills. I initially feared that a replacement would be quite expensive based on previous experience. 
Hank and Don couldn't have been more courteous, friendly or helpful even if they had tried. Within less than 1/2 hour my bumper was reattached, touched up and ready to go. 
 When  it comes to Guldner's body shop  I can't praise their skill  and honest, personalized service too highly."
__label__3	"Breakfast here is a bad idea.

The burrito was tiny for the price. Had a nasty oniony chili sauce....ecch!

The coffee tasted like it was brewed from the underwear of a bum. Orange juice was not an option for my ""meal deal""

I refuse to ever go there for breakfast again

Giving 3 stars because I like their lunch menu."
__label__5	This restaurant was one of the best meals I've had out ever. We've been to this sister restaurant antica before and had been very impressed - but this place was even better!! Love that it's byob and the menu makes it very hard to choose an entree. We started with clam chowder and it was the best I've ever had (and I've tried many!) Service is outstanding and everyone is friendly. The flavors are true Italian flavors and you can tell they really value their establishment and the food they serve. Go! You won't be disappointed!
__label__5	I will give this place 5 stars because they are the only Sambo's still open. Actually this is the origional Sambos's. Cudos to them for not buckling under to the establishment. Lived in this town for two years and always stopped here for breakfast.
__label__4	This is a wonderful little gem! I had the lobster ravioli, which was pretty good. However, I felt the breading overpowered the lobster flavor a bit. Still decent though! My husband got the filet and it was fabulous. We also really liked the bruschetta appetizer! We really enjoyed it and will definitely be returning. I'll be getting something different next time though :)
__label__5	Nasty princess is a must!!! Visiting from Cali first time in Nashville and the wife found this gem. Now one thing is for sure its not a hidden gem because this joint was jumpin. The biscuit and hot chicken smothered in gravy is what dreams are made of the homemade sausage was delicious . Ignore the excessive pepper that's my jam. We will definitely make this a stop if we ever go back to Nashville.
__label__2	The service was slow and the food is average. They don't have much of a beer selection so I just had water.   My kids wanted a milk shake but they only had two of the multiple flavors listed on the menu and several sliders we unavailable.  We spent over $60 and didn't get what we were hoping for at this new restaurant.
__label__3	I've gotten two tattoos at Shambhala and while they do fairly decent work (neither of my tattoos were complicated) and their shop is clean, it's really nothing special. Overall it's rather dingy and the shop is very open so there isn't any privacy between the tattoo stations. If you're looking to drop some big money on tattoo I would probably look elsewhere.
__label__1	I ordered my glasses on 12/12/16. Still waiting for them and the amount of excuses and finger pointing on who's fault it is, is quite astonishing. What do they do for me? Nothing! They say they cannot do anything to compensate me for my time and headaches waiting for my glasses.
__label__1	Sat at the bar. Took forever to be acknowledged. Took forever to get drinks. Bar was filthy and the managers were standing around talking. Horrible experience. I'll definitely drive extra to go to East Norriton
__label__5	Marvelous!  We were rescued from the mediocre by this excellent small, intimate wonderful restaurant.  While in town for a convention at one of the large hotels we finally escaped to this bistro.  What a wonderful experience, with competent thoughtful service and excellent food.  Bison!  Halibut!  Both properly prepared and presented.  If you must be in Reno .... attend this establishment!
__label__5	We've been going there for 15 years.  Absolute favorite place to eat at.  The margaritas are full of tequila!!
__label__5	It was delicious. I tried lover and hello kitty roll. Manager Allison was very kind and answered all my questions. Staff is very friendly
__label__1	i would have given 2 stars, but service was so crappy i'm taking off a star. our waitress was nice, but was very slow. we tried to flag down another waitress and she was clearly ignoring us. we ordered sushi and it was brought out without any chopsticks or soy sauce. my friends ordered hot drinks and it did not come out hot. i miss sushi, but will have to wait till i'm in ATL to satisfy this craving.
__label__5	If you love oysters you have to come here for their happy hour. Great oysters, great prices. Drink specials too. The frozen mojito was delicious. And strong! The bar area is quite large but I would get there a little before happy hour starts to secure a seat. I appreciate that they had a lot of gluten free options. This was another reason I choose to eat here. I wanted to go back a second night while visiting New Orleans but my husband and I thought we should try new places.
__label__3	A spikey experience.  Rooms and infrastructure are well kept and have a funky decor.  Good location.  Service is a bit indifferent, especially the lobby staff and bar.  With all the hotels in the area, I am not sure I would pick this one again, but not a terrible choice.
__label__5	This is hands down the most authentic, delicious Thai in Nashville. Better even than Esane. It's cheap, wonderfully spiced, complex. Just so so tasty. Highly recommend any of the curries. They also have brown rice as an optional side - a rarity in Nashville.
__label__4	Got the fish tacos, I was a fan. Very juicy so make sure not to spill on yourself and use lots of napkins! Service was great, good price and we didn't wait long at all. I've heard great things about their breakfast, so I will most definitely be back.
__label__5	Best pizza in the area!!! Their house salad is addicting and the meatball parm sandwich on pizza dough is heavenly!!! I'm leaving the area soon and this is one of the two places I'll miss the most.
__label__1	"So, a traditional Cuban is made with ham, roasted pork, Swiss cheese, pickles, mustard, and sometimes salami on Cuban bread.  Well, there was no roasted pork to be found, it was made with lettuce, a slice of ham, cheddar cheese, tomato and lots of mayo.  I asked for it pressed - it was about 4  1/2"" thick............will never go back again."
__label__4	Awesome food at great prices!   The place may not look like much but that is part of the low overhead and low prices.   They also have great sandwiches as well as the famous empanadas .
__label__4	I ordered pizza and anchovies as a side - when they came, I asked if the anchovies were included, and the delivery guy said they were - but when opening the box, the anchovies were missing! I called to complain, and they actually sent a driver to refund the anchovies plus the delivery fee. The pizza was fine - management and customer service were excellent!
__label__4	"We are so glad we found this place. It's a very small oasis from the downtown casinos. 

Liked
- clean restaurant
- attentive service (water glasses filled frequently)
- popcorn chicken bento
- beef noodle soup (did not skimp on the stewed beef)
- fried calamari 
- 'stinky' tofu
- appropriate spiciness and seasoning
- parking although limited spaces

They ran out of the stewed pork which I was craving. Oh well. 

Overall, good food, good service and authentic! Glad Reno has one of these restaurants."
__label__4	The ghost tour was great! Andy was very entertaining and full of information. The tour is 2 hours long so make sure you have comfortable q shoes and you even get to go inside one of the buildings. That stop is also a drink and bathroom break. I would go on a tour with Andy any time.
__label__5	Everything we have had tastes wonderful here. The service is great and the ambience is elegant yet casual. We can't wait to dine on the outdoor patio. A bit pricier than other Mexican restaurants but worth it.
__label__4	This location is much better than the downtown location for some reason. I usually stick to the California burrito, because it's tasty and always hits the spot. The price is fair, at around $8 it's a decent sized burrito. And of course they're open 24 hours, which is always clutch, especially on Friday and Saturday nights.
__label__5	The bartender is super nice here. Very patient with our orders and specifications. Once a homeless lady came up with a few spare change and he made her a drink anyways. Would come again and again here.
__label__5	Best ice cream ever.  It's the process they use, whatever it is it rocks!  Tastes real and not overly buttery.  I got the ice cream sandwich Axxess deal and was very happy.  I like this modern location better than the Mission one, just purely for aesthetic reasons.
__label__1	We ordered take out & we were thoroughly disappointed with not only the quantity based on the cost, but the lack of taste in the food we ordered. Very poor compared to other restaurants that offer much better food at more reasonable prices. There must be a reason no one was in the restaurant. Never again.
__label__5	Kat Smo is the best. I moved here from Arizona about five months ago, so as any female I was hesitant to try something new or someone new because finding a great hairdresser is beyond hard to find, so I kept putting it off over and over again until I just couldn't anymore. Finally I met Kat, I came in super nervous, she was so nice and easy going that it put me and my anxiety at ease. I always thought I could never replace the salon I left in Arizona and now I will never allow another person to even touch my hair again.
__label__5	I'm glad this location is now open but it's super busy.  I was seated after 25 mins. in a back room.  The room has 2 televisions  & seafood decorations.  Promptly served by the waiter, David.  Ordered steamed Oysters with garlic butter seasoning which was good.  I ordered the 1/2 pound of shrimp & 1/2 pound of snow crabs.  It comes with one potato & one piece of corn on a cob. I got the  mild garlic butter seasoning.   Everything was delicious!!
__label__4	It's your typical Pizzeria Uno. I do like that they offer a create your own pizza for the kids.
__label__1	Never go there. The sales reps are liars and fool customers with false rate plans. Would never go there again. Worst service ever!
__label__4	I really like this place for lunch. The ramen was very good. I had the chef's special. Maybe a tad salty, but all the ingredients were delicious. Service was fast and courteous. The tables were set and clean.
__label__4	Good place for party supplies. Large clean store, with a generous selection of goods. Aisles a bit narrow, otherwise a good choice. Staff very helpful. Lots of costumes for Halloween .
__label__3	Tourist trap. You can find much better food in the French Quarters rather than waiting in line.
__label__3	This is loud place. Service was great. Ordered the bbq ribs. The ribs taste like lighter fluid. Food came out fast. Great beer selection. I would go back for the beer not the food.
__label__5	One of my favorite places to eat.  My favorites are the catfish, whitefish, tenderloin, and the chicken wings.  Service is always good because the servers have worked their forever.  Prices can't be beat.  I'm happy the owner has made sure there is an affordable place to eat in downtown Zionsville.
__label__3	"There are so many better Mexican places in Philly, especially that area near the Italian market, but I suppose it's better than nothing for the 'burbs. Still, the food was poorly seasoned and slightly over salted, and at best Tacos were kind of sad really, especially the flavorless mushroom one. Draught beers and ""bottle bar"" were fine, but staff was poorly informed."
__label__5	Great fish n chips! Cool place in the up and coming ate of The Gulch. The drinks and cocktails are authentic and the service is super friendly. The dark wood paneling will make you feel like you're truly across the pond in s pub. Oh, and don't forget the darts in the back!
__label__5	Food amazing, fresh, creative.  Service amazing.  Parking convenient too.  Do yourself a favor and skip the chains-come here for breakfast and leave happy and full!  So glad we found it!
__label__3	I made a reservation for 8 and we all ordered popular dishes such as the chile rellano, crab cakes, chilaques, etc. In our opinion, we felt that the food was pretty salty across the board! If you aren't big on salty food, i wouldn't recommend this place. Other than the food, the aesthetic was nice and the waiting staff was pretty good.
__label__2	They do not have the Ocean Spray sparkling cranberry juice that every Rite Aid on the east coast has.  Booooo!  And there were a bunch of loud Indians arguing there.
__label__2	This place is a nice location...however the night crew is horrible. No Brown rice. 20 min wait on brown rice. Person on front line had no idea how long it would be. Had to ask and seemed annoyed. No Sweet tea. Still had to be brewed.
__label__1	Terrible place. The staff is very disrespectful if you don't look like you belong in Tampa or make a certain amount of money. If I could give it 0 stars I would. There are a lot of better places to go then this place.
__label__4	Swim Mor built our pool and has some seasonal maintenance for us . The pool turned out beautiful and we find them to be reliable and consistent.
__label__2	Sat at bar. Rude  of no help bartender with red hair offered 0 help with flights.  Was rude to us.  Beers ok but she ruined our whole brewery experience. We left very disgusted.
__label__5	I brought a couple dozen Beverly cookies to a party last weekend and cut them into quarters. People were actually OMGing out loud. They're that good. Leave the cookies and cakes at the super market, and make the stop at Beverly's for the good stuff!
__label__2	"Sorry.   I don't get it.     $20 for a sandwich, side, and fountain drink?    Really?    

Easily the most overhyped, overrated, and overpriced  eatery in the city.    It's just cold cuts, people.   Get a grip.    Goose the Market has good sandwiches too and you don't have to take out a second loan on your home to buy one."
__label__3	Good food. Menu was too busy and they did not carry rolls that are common. Nice atmosphere. Service was ok.
__label__5	I highly recommend Dian Xin! We had a great time. It's very affordable so we were able to try several different dim sum plates. Everything we tried was good. The service was also very fast. I would definitely return. Soup dumplings were great!
__label__1	"Went in hopeful, as the last restaurant in this location was awful. 
Unfortunately, it still is!
If you like FRESH food - not here.
Frozen veggies. 
Frozen fish
Tough beef
Our one and only visit
Food was so mediocre, McDonald's would be an improvement."
__label__1	Not open 24!  Spend my break going to a business , just close !!!! If you are not available 24/7
__label__2	We went here based on awards and reviews.  Gumbo was good.  But the steak was so salty it was inedible.   Guess it was my bad for ordering steak at a seafood place.  Wife enjoyed her salmon.
__label__1	They got caught short cutting safety recalls by the Toyota rep and had to call back 100 sienna vans to redo them
__label__5	There's a reason why this place is packed every day for the past 30 years. Good food and everyone knows your name. The place where New Yorkers go to get that authentic neighborhood pizzeria experience. The food is always fresh. As you stand waiting at the counter, you wish every order that comes up was yours.
__label__5	Grilled chicken nuggets! Dip them in the Polynesian and Spicy Buffalo sauce. Mmmm  They are nothing like typical fast food nuggets. Real chicken breast chopped up into smaller but sized pieces, and grilled. A bit on the small size, so you might want to go with a 12 piece of mega-hungry.
__label__5	I've grown up coming here and I love this place. It's a mini grocery store and takeout restaurant all in one. They have the best breakfast Cuban I've ever had. Most flavorful home fries I've had.  I would also definitely recommend they're normal Cuban. They have a wide variety of chips, juices, and sodas. I love there cafe con leche. Overall Just a great place to go. Very convenient too. The owner is very nice and gets to know a lot of his customers personally. It's a south tampa staple
__label__1	"We just attended an event at Ft. De Soto which had hired Sunstar paramedics. A member of my party was badly bitten by fire ants, but the ""paramedics"" told him that they had nothing to help him. No cortisone? No benadryl? No calamine? What kind of ""first aid"" DO they have? Fire ants are everywhere in Florida."
__label__3	I would never order here again.  All my co-workers do but everytime I have for some reason it is my order that is wrong and you could never tell them something is missing because it is an arguement.  The food is not bad, but I found not worth someone yelling at me that it was in the bag.  Now I found much better food in the Fairmount area.  Thanks to bad customer service.
__label__1	Wait more than 25 minutes for the foods coming up after order. Don't come here when you are hungry, especially on holidays.
__label__5	Great cupcakes! Loved the icing and the cake. We also really enjoyed the cookie sandwich!
__label__5	Absolute best FroYo I have ever had. Hands down. I can even describe how perfectly tart yet sweet the taste was. It's an Italian recipe that started in 93 - I have never seen another location and hope they get one in DC! Otherwise, standard toppings to add but the liquid toppings (caramel, chocolate etc) seem to be their unique trait and very popular! Must try if you love froyo!
__label__1	Very poor lighting throughout restaurant. Expensive low quality food served cold, without a smile.
__label__5	Tasty pizza, cold beer and a nice, dog friendly patio. The slices come a bit faster than the full pies, but that is to be expected. Everything was really good and seemed fresh. Decent beer selection as well, and not so loud that you couldn't have a conversation.
__label__5	"I love this Getgo location! It's always kept very clean and tidy. The best part is their made to order espresso bar. 

They have a variety of selections the same as any coffee shop would including frozen and specialty drinks. The market also has food options available."
__label__5	Loved this place, not only was the food amazing but it was ready super fast and the costomer service was excellent.  My kids even loved it!  We will defienitly be coming back!
__label__1	Do not recommend  this vet mrs dose has very bad bedside manner, rude, took my cat here and could not go back in visit because of pandemic when i got my cat home she was limping, when you ask questions  about diagnosis  shes defensive  and makes you feel degraded that you asked.
__label__4	This is the first Hudson's I'd been to. I went this summer when I was in the university area killing time before a park and ride. I've only been to this one and the one downtown and I kind of prefer this one. It's smaller, more intimate, the atmosphere is more social. The food and such are about the same. I like the photos on the wall of way past grads of the U of A. It's neat to see familiar historical names and photos.
__label__4	This is an awesome fried chicken joint. The chicken was juicy on the inside, and not too greasy on the outside. Perfect on a Friday afternoon with a cold beer . I got here 4:45 PM, and there was absolutely no wait ;)
__label__4	Had a shrimp poboy, boiled crawfish, boiled shrimp and corn. The poboy was very good and huge. Probably the best weve had so far. The rest was okay. We had to take a cab to get there and had a hard time getting a cab to take us back. So, if you really want to go there, you should be driving or have a good way to get back. Doesn't look like the safest area to get stuck in. Prices were really low.
__label__5	Meun Fan is one of my favorite Thai restaurants in Santa Barbara! It's great quality, authentic and not too expensive. Get the pad see ew or pad Thai; also love the eggplant dish. Service was okay
__label__1	I went here for lunch and was very disappointed. I got the lunch special one and it came w what was supposedly an egg roll which I wouldn't even try. It smelled like vinegar wrapped in a shell. Then the chicken was just okay. The fried rice it came w was something I've never seen before. No veggies in it. The service was poor and the water tastes better from my sink at home. Won't be coming back.
__label__4	"Really excellent neigborhood spot with amazing, friendly staff and a good selection of rolls. The one thing I wish they had is more variety in starters. The past few times I've gone, I've asked for recommendations on rolls and their suggestions have been excellent! Sunburn and volcano rolls are my favorite. This is a great place to try out new rolls too, as the prices are extremely reasonable. 

I always thought that the coffee/sushi bar combo was odd, but in fact I am happy to end my meal with a great cup of coffee."
__label__4	Good clean atmosphere, friendly staff and good prices. Been here dozens of times with my family and haven't had a bad meal. Will say the deep fried rolls aren't for me, but had to give them a try. Gives me my sushi fix when we can't make it downtown.  Good quality fish, you gotta try to volcano roll.
__label__5	Went there today for the first time and will definitely return. I went with my mom and we ordered the KoKo and Big Jim. The biscuits were fresh, chicken was tender and not greasy, and the sides were perfection (we got French fries and Mac n cheese). The staff was extremely polite and attentive. Food came out in an efficient amount of time. The diner was clean and welcoming. It was an overall great experience
__label__5	Tiki Tolteca is definitely a shining star in a city that has bars in abundance. The service is quite personal and the drinks are impeccable. Start with a Hemingway Daiquiri while you look over the menu. Order a drink. And then order another Hemingway. Trader Dick definitely knows what he is doing.
__label__5	We went for the lunch buffet. The cuisine is definitely Pakistani/Afghan. The sindhi chicken biryani was perfect. The chicken haleem was delicious and stellar (wish they had the authentic side additions)! The buttered naan was soft yet had a slight authentic crunch on the outside - just right! The pulao was okay - not the best i've had, but still acceptable. There is plenty of room for seating and the atmosphere is relaxed. The eggplant curry was legitimately probably the best eggplant curry I've ever had. We will be back for more!
__label__4	As far as vegan meals go this place was above average. I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the energy put into creating the upscale environment and food. The people eating there were pretty stuffy but that is what you get when you pay a higher price for meals like this these days. I was surprised bye the wait staff (hipsters). But overall I got the Vegetable meal...It was delicious. Vegan Dessert was ok. The ginger tonic was amazing. My mother who was with me also really enjoyed the Tuna.
__label__5	Loved this place!! We came for dinner and had an incredible experience. The waiters were so nice and friendly and attentive (SHOUT OUT TO JUSTIN, YOU'RE AWESOME!!!) and the food was exactly what we were looking for after a night out. I got the filet mignon pho, and the broth was delicious and light. I also got the pork banh mi, which was refreshing and full of flavor. The portions are very large, so come hungry!
__label__5	This place is a fantastic find for anyone who wants a delightful veggie meal at cheap prices! I was blown away. Will definitely return!!! So happy it's in my neighborhood!!!!!
__label__5	"Great doughnuts in the heart of University City. 
Made to order deliciousness. You won't be disappointed."
__label__3	A nice atmosphere and a friendly greeting.  We sat outside and there was a singer nice touch.  Friendly waiter but flighty no drink refills.  $11 rib special came with beans and potato salad.  Tasted good but 3 skinny ribs.  Didn't feel it was worth the money.  Had been a few a months ago and was disappointed in the burger which is supposed to be a specialty.  Would love to give a non chain a chance but after twice my meals were just average.
__label__5	The best ghost tour in NOLA! We tookt the 5-1 and it was the highlight of our trip
__label__5	Had one of the best cheesteaks from this place. Seasoned well and very filling; definitely going back when in town!
__label__2	Just wasn't comfortable with this one.  My main issue with the place was that the crates and play areas were in the same room so there was always a lot of noise.  Also they were wire crates and not truly divided pins.  Although the smaller crates had some sort of divider I was worried that they were to close together.  Also the dogs in the play area were not constantly supervised.  Things can happen so quickly even with normally good dogs that I always want mine supervised.  While the owner has good intentions and clearly likes dogs I couldn't leave mine here comfortably.
__label__5	Ken made this ring you see here. I came in originally to have another ring sized, and he was the only person in town that was able to do it over night. Then I walked into the shop and saw this beauty. I originally thought that it would be just completely out of my price range, WRONG. He made the band silver for me and brought the ring up 2 sizes over night and the total cost was $540. I couldn't believe it. I couldn't recommend this place enough!
__label__5	OMG!! I dont even really care for see food but hot damn this place is awesome!!!! Delicous food fish po boy melted in my mouth char broiled oysters were on point!!!
__label__5	Great food, great ambiance.  Came here for lunch with clients.  Everything we had was wonderful - Pad Thai, Salads.  Service outstanding.  A class act.
__label__5	This was the best pizza I have had in awhile. We had the margarita pizza with Shrimp and it was so amazing. The shrimp were perfectly cooked and the dough was great. It had a sweetness to it that I loved. If you are in the Garden District definitely stop in for a quick delicious bite.
__label__5	Ever since I came here, I fell in love with oysters. Great find. Come early, lines are out the door to get a table. Can't wait to go back to New Orleans to have more!!
__label__4	Excellent food but not very good service. Very slow and not attentive. Reasonable price. Didn't take reservations for a large party but the wait isn't long.
__label__1	Ghetto and expensive but I don't mind purchasing seafood from here. I don't like the crab legs because it isn't snow crabs
__label__3	Food is terrible ,the place is cute but the food is horrible my third time there and the food is nasty !!
__label__5	"The experience we had at this restaurant was extraordinary. I am so glad we chose this for my brothers graduation. The food was delicious, the service was on points and Chef Zak was there every step to guide us and accommodate us at the table side. 
I was in love with chef Gordon Ramsay, but this was a thousand times much better. Highly highly recommend it! Gorgeous, beautiful, delicious and Chef Zak himself was so humbling and honest, a treasure that makes this restaurant - shine!"
__label__5	Walked in not knowing what to expect.  Friendly gentleman at the service counter handed us a menu. Looked it over and found something that sounded good.  This place is clean, very friendly, the mild salsa had one of the best flavors I've ever had.  The green Chile chicken tamale was excellent, the Chile relleno tamale was excellent.  Our taste buds are delighted!  Customer service is great, we were even surprised with a chocolate tamale   We will definitely be back.
__label__3	"The service wasn't spectacular and there weren't very many customers in there.
The food is pretty pricey for what you get... The gyros were good, but I've had bigger and better ones for less in Indianapolis."
__label__4	"As a teenager in the late 1980's, I used to work for Dave, the owner, and helped manage the store.

I am glad that the business finally moved to a bigger space as his inventory used to bust at the seems, b/c of the previous, tiny location.

My 20 yr old daughter and I are planning to visit the new location today for the 1st time!

I know it will be a great experience for her since she's a fan of comics and shops at a store downtown."
__label__1	This place sucks ass I do not recommend I would give it half a star doesn't even deserve a full one
__label__4	Food was good.  pork belly sandwich was excellent although kind of small. muffaleta was a pretty sizable portion, and it was good, but kind of salty.  brussel sprouts were good.
__label__5	Pricey but worth every penny. Great selection of imported Italian (real Italian) goods. Great meat section too. I would shop at Mazzaro's everyday if I lived closer.
__label__1	"We didn't get the chance to eat here. We really wanted to bring our family to celebrate our daughter. Called 12-14 times in 1 day to make reservations for a Party of 14 and NEVER got an answer. It's a shame to attempt to spend that amount of money at an establishment and get an automated system, go through all of the ""options"" and never get to a person. I also emailed for the reservations, which said to call if I needed an answer sooner than the 48 hour response that it would take."
__label__2	There were no towels in the room . There was hair in my bathtub. The sheets were dirty and stained. My room smelt like an old lady died. There was a bug in the bed . And a large hair on a towel. However , the bagels were good.
__label__5	This is my second time here at Willie Mae's and the food is wonderful. It really lived up to its reputation as having the Best Fried Chicken. It has a homey feel to the restaurant which I love! Small, quaint, and decorative! I will always remember this place when I come to New Orleans.
__label__3	Very good breakfast, at a reasonable price. Very friendly staff, but parking can be a challenge.
__label__1	I really have no idea how you can screw up Bar Food, but this place has figured it out. It is a Hot Mess. Worst wings in Tampa, always over fried, chewy, with a low meat quality: That is if you even get any meat at all. We have given this place 3 tries before writing a review and that is simply because the kitchen is open late night when everyone else is closed. Frankly, my boyfriend and I would go to bed hungry every time if given the option- Even if the food was free. Yea, it's that bad.
__label__1	Bad service, the manager and staff where rude and uncooperative. There's better hotels for the same price.
__label__4	"I have been to Mangia several times now and I am never disappointed with the food. Their pizza is excellent and make sure you ask for crispy bottom..you will love it.

The restaurant is nicely decorated. Since this is a standard strip mall unit, space is a bit limited, however they have managed to squeeze in a few tables. If you are looking for a romantic ambiance, this is not the place for you. However, if you want to enjoy some good food at reasonable cost, then this is the place!!"
__label__5	I love grain and berry and am so happy they have a south tampa location! My only problem with grain and berry is that I want everything on the menu! In my opinion, they have the best açaí bowl in all of Tampa! Their bowls are always ice cold and toppings are always fresh. They also have my favorite avocado toast: the caprese.
__label__5	One of the best meals I have had in my life. Definitely in New Orleans. Everything was so thoughtfully and artfully prepared. It was a great experience.
__label__5	I got a airbrush tan here for my bachelorette party and it turned out amazing. I had only ever gotten spray tans in booths before and this airbrush was so much better. My tan looked so natural and faded so naturally too. I got the express tan so I could shower sooner and it was definitely worth the extra money. Thank you Sugared + Bronzed for giving me the perfect glow for my bachelorette weekend!
__label__4	Great burger (tiny bit too salty), had the Goodland but made it veggie - add avocado and arugula. Not my favorite price. Two burgers with a couple of extras, two beers, fries, tax + tip and we were at $50. The atmosphere is just okay, maybe it's the lighting? Maybe try eating outside or just taking it to-go. Will definitely be back, because it's that good. Will try the SB location next time.
__label__5	"I am constantly on the hunt for the best burger in the city. While I have had a lot of really great ones, I haven't found my favorite yet. Until now...

We got carry out and I can say that this place did not disappoint. YES to their burgers. You must try them and YES to their shakes! Their butterscotch shake is so delicious. Love this spot in Irvington!"
__label__5	I grew up on the border in San Diego, California so my standards are high and I had pretty much given up on finding places that satisfy my cravings in the Philadelphia area unless I travel out to Norristown or one spot in South Philly. I am so excited to have truly authentic Mexican food in my West Philly neighborhood at last! We went opening week so it was still very busy, but the wait time was reasonable and the food was amazing. Plus on the house handmade tortilla chips made my heart and tastebuds so happy!  This will definitely be one of my new favorite places to visit!
__label__2	"Server...awesome!  Food...not so much!  

I was so looking forward to eating here but once I stepped through the door I was not impressed.  I expected so much more from the reviews I read.

Stuffed meatballs were not stuffed.  Sweet chili garlic wings had no garlic flavor.  And the bacon in the French onion soup which is one of my husband's favorite dishes fell flat.

If you want to place to get a good drink and mediocre food be my guest."
__label__5	GO HERE. Cozy, laid back, awesome music, and the owner is fantastic. This is a great getaway from the whiny, typical Nashvegas country croons. Never had a bad experience here. Hidden down Printer's Alley. Try to come when Jackie sings. She is PHENOMENAL. Phil is a great owner, as well as the nicest person you will ever meet. Stephanie is genuine, funny and in amazing shape. Okay, back to the bar. It is a great place to meet people, and you would be surprised how many big wigs come here....
__label__4	Deliciousness was had at Barrio yesterday. I had whiteout burger which came sandwiched between torta bread (my favorite) with seasoned fries. Also tried the tequila cilantro wings. I personally found the wings to be the best part of the meal. The only negative thing about the experience was the waitress. She acted like she 1) didn't want to be there and 2) didn't have the time to really help us. I would return, I just hope I'm not seated in her area again.
__label__5	I love nail pros. They always do their best to get me in even when I don't make an appointment. I tried the almond shape the last time I went there. They have an extensive shade range of dip powders, gel and regular nail polish.
__label__5	This place chill. The food was good and the service was amazing! Our server Hailey was fantastic, on point and quick. If you go here to eat ask for her!
__label__5	Great food... The beef on weck is incredible. They make really good pizzas too. Sometimes it gets really crowded but service is good.. I eat here at least once a week with my family and always a good dining experience.
__label__5	I recently stopped into SEE after I saw the amazing glasses my co-worker had found there. I was not prepared for the never ending wonderful, funky, fearless styles that they had. I wound up getting two pair. After visiting most of the big chain opticals and a boutique or two, I found the prices to be very reasonable and the styles unbeatable. Check them out if you want to get the most style for your money! Ask for John, he is not only knowledgeable but cute and a lot of fun.
__label__1	"First time customer at cherry hill location. Ordered wine, burger and coleslaw. Burger was good, but was disgusted by black hair in my coleslaw. 
They took $3.00 charge off my bill, the price of the coleslaw. No apology or attempt by management or server to address the issue or approach me or compensate me in any way. 
Will not  go back or recommend this restaurant."
__label__5	My co-workers and I eat here most Fridays. They have the best BBQ in Indy. And the staff is super friendly. You won't be disappointed.
__label__4	Great spot close to the beach, the fish taco fried was phenomenal, burrito was ok but not great. Their bowls looked amazing will be adding this into my beach front rotation. For lunch and dinner!
__label__5	"Food was great and staff was very friendly!
We were here as a spur of the moment thing and we were pleased surprised."
__label__5	Richie probably hears it all the time, but seriously... what a sweetheart and a truly caring, wonderful soul. Thanks for the treatment, I feel like a kid again! Now... can you make my gray hair go away for good?
__label__3	I went during lunch time on a Sunday. It was not busy at all so the service was really fast. They have a really good lunch menu. The portions are reasonable and the food is ok. My Pad thai needed more flavor, it was bland. If you are looking for great authentic Thai food this is not the place but I will said is a good lunch place.
__label__4	The service was good, being able to have a 750 degree stone in front of you to cook your steak to your liking piece by piece was a great experience!
__label__5	For the price you pay the amount of food you receive is insane. The food is also really delicious and I plan on going back staff members are friendly aswell
__label__5	Most amazing food we had on vacation. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, there was a long wait, but it was well worth it!
__label__1	"Wine is $9 a glass - not very good choices -- for a 4oz portion. When asked why the wine glass wasn't filled, a very ignorant ""manager"" came out and said they only give a 4 oz portion and if I didn't want it, he'd take it back. I told him to take it back and we went across to the street to Havana's. MUCH BETTER!!!!"
__label__5	"Best ever!!! I have been getting take out here since the 90's and always been perfect.  In a city where new restaurants pop up every week, it is good to know you can trust Alyan's to impress!  Last monday I had a date with the toughest food critic; My Mother. The lentil soup full of little bits of flavor, Hoummos, Spinach and mushroom pie was better than home made so said me mom. 
Thank you, Alyan's"
__label__4	I have to say the food is pretty good. Pizza always fresh and wings are ways great but the speed os very slow. They will tell you 15 minutes and then you are really waiting about 45 min on a weekday with no one in there. Also the owners girlfriend wife or whatever works there and is very rude. She often is yelling at her toddler kids and very poor attitude. Other than that great food so thats why we keep going back.
__label__1	DO NOT RENT FROM JG. They treated us like children and would email me back when I specifically asked to call me back. Nothing was fixed in a reasonable time and majority of people were just all around disrespectful. I have not one positive comment to make about JG. Save yourself the time and stress
__label__2	I am Mexican so was not a big fan of Spanish food when I first moved to the Tampa area.  After a while, I learned to appreciate Spanish food.  Heard so much about the Columbia Restaurant and due to company functions and organizations that I belonged to, was introduced to the Columbia Restaurant.  Have experienced their food several times and still wonder what is the big deal about this place.
__label__4	"Menu choices for a new comer here. Try chili dumplings and ginger scallion chicken stir fry, both great choices! 
Service was efficient, very friendly people."
__label__1	Had an appt for hitch install. Called the day before to verify. Spoke with call center cause no one answers their phone. Call center said hitch was available. Showed up for appt and hitch was not available.  And that I only scheduled for light kit. Also saying hitch will not fit car even though their website says it will.   Don't come here. Terrible service. No one has a clue what's going on.
__label__4	I love this neighborhood greasy spoon! They have the best fried onion rings.
__label__4	The food and drinks were good. We arrived about 15 minutes early and they were able to seat us right away. After that the service started going down hill. It took us a while to get just water. After we ordered our dinner the time periods between the waitresses visits became longer and longer. By the end of our meal we hadn't seen her in so long that we had to ask one of the food runners walking by to try and find her. He enlisted the help of a hostess who said she couldn't find her either so she printed the checks for us.
__label__4	"This hotel is beautiful! A complimentary valet service is included and the staff is extremely friendly. They even called minutes after i got in my room to see if everything was ""up to par"". The reason I give 4 stars is because the bathroom smells strongly of urine and the hotel lobby smells of smoke from the casino. Despite those small problems my boyfriend and I will be staying here again next time we are in the st.louis area."
__label__5	Classic and consistent Thai place, very reasonably priced-- plus the owners and staff are kind.
__label__5	Customer service at the front is great! They just put in New self check out machines which make everything move much faster. Everyone I meet is very helpful!
__label__4	Went to lunch while at the Commerce office right behind it. Who would've thought a $12 endless sushi and hibachi place would be this good. I ordered a ton of sushi rolls. Everything was good and the rainbow looked pretty, but was my least favorite. Got the spicy Mongolian beef spicy. Too many onions so order light on onions. Service was solid and she handled the party of 10 effortlessly. Recommend if looking for a lunch spot in the area.
__label__1	This pizza was horrible. There was very little sauce and what was there was incredibly bland. The toppings were minimal too. The crust tasted like cardboard and even my dog didn't want it. I've tried this place twice. I thought the first time the terrible pizza was a fluke because their ratings were so high. The second order was just as bad as the first. Save yourself the trouble and don't order from them.
__label__5	Delicious!! Husband and I have wanted to try this place for a long time and finally did! Despite the plain storefront look, inside is incredible warm and romantic! The food was exquisite - we enjoyed the shrimp dumplings, spicy crispy chicken and the salmon that was cooked to perfection. Delicious, affordable and the waitress was wonderful. We'll be back again soon!
__label__5	This is my favorite pizza in Nashville. I usually get one of the slice specials of the day. They are always delicious!! I'm a big fan of the arugula salad, too.
__label__5	We called Joe about a long-time mouse problem and he came within an hour (on a Saturday). He noted some things a previous exterminator didn't take care of. He checked meticulously for where the problem was coming from and dealt with all the sources. Would definitely recommend!
__label__1	I am forced to pay for this terrible trash removal service by my apartment community, but Valet Living does not provide the service. They have no incentive to do better because residents can't even opt out.
__label__1	This is the busiest, messiest, grumpiest Walmart ever.  I only really like it cause Mr. Ghetto used it in his video - I'll give them one star for that.
__label__4	I have been shopping at Macy's just about all my life, this is one place I can almost be positive I will find something not only do I like but will fit. Macy's always seem to carry brands that will fit me. I am very petit person so I have a hard time finding the right fits. Great sales and always on top of the latest fashion trends.
__label__5	Soooo good!!! That's literally all I have to say. Definitely worth the wait.  Plus you can purchase a variety of drinks and the box mix of beignets.
__label__5	Took the family for a nice dinner and we are so glad we went here. Our server Michele was great from start to finish.  She was attentive and helped describe the menu to us and out 7yr old daughter. The food was outstanding and one of the best meals in all of Clearwater Beach. We got the Grouper sandwich and Surf and Turf which was huge and phenomenal.
__label__4	Juicy burgers, with a great Monday burger special. The staff is super friendly, and we enjoy eating here whenever we go. I especially love the garlic sauce you can add to the burger, yuuummy! Also love the variety of toppings.
__label__5	Always great service and atmosphere. A little far of a drive but I still end up here twice a month for good food that's cheap. Get an infinitos membership card and try the Alfredo pizza! You will thank me!
__label__4	"Usually a winery that promotes ""crazy blends"" indicates that they've had a lot of bad grapes on hand and they decided to throw it all into a barrel to see what good could come of it.  That's definitely not the case here.  All the reds were hit our palates quite nicely.  The tasting room hostess was very helpful and made us feel right at home."
__label__5	Pellerito's is our new Go-to pizza joint. Their crust and sauce are great. I love a plain pie with fresh garlic. Just delicious.  Service is adequate. They deliver.  Nice folks.
__label__5	My friendly neighborhood market.  Great sandwiches, great gelato, great meat, great beer, great wine... Great place to buy your Thanksgiving Turkey, brine, and more!
__label__5	Excellent,  intricate work by Curtis at Ybor! My husband and I came in on a whim and they were able to squeeze us in.  Curtis was very polite and cordial.  His use of color is amazing,  especially my husband's all green hop leaves. The colors just pop! Love it! Go see Curtis!
__label__5	"Went in to check out the new bakery on the corner. They have all kinds of baked goodies. I got a cup of coffee and couple fresh out of the oven cinnamon rolls.  These are definitely made in house and not a frozen rolls. Coffee was awesome. . Highly suggest people go get one of those. Also the baked goods looked so good. We're going there for lunch since I am working at the church next door

Lunch was ,Awesome to say the least. Highly suggest the Barnyard pulled pork nachos"
__label__1	I'm giving this a one star out of respect for the hard working employees only. However the owner Rob Thompson, who controls them is only interested in money not quality or heaven forbid, finishing a job once he's been paid.. I've been waiting for 3 weeks after I paid him for a simple completion of an outlet and he refuses to even answer, return a phone call or a text. STAY AWAY, there are lot more qualified merchants in town.
__label__5	Cute cafe with great food. I had the shrimp and grits and it was awesome! Finished every bit of it. The jasmine iced tea is also a must. My only regret is that I didn't get any of their baked goods.
__label__4	Delicious! I had the chicken butter and my boyfriend had the chicken madras. We also had the chili corn as an appetizer. Great wait staff too!
__label__5	Got a cut & partial highlights with Jenae. She was absolutely wonderful to speak with, but of course it was the final product that really impressed me. She was more than willing to go above and beyond to give me the look I was going for. Personable, talented, and located extremely conveniently downtown. Everyone else in the salon is a pleasure to be around as well, so you really can't lose!
__label__3	Too long winded a tour if you bring kids (and maybe for their parents:).  Very interesting if you are into history and have the patience.  Our guide was incredibly knowledgeable, but again there were a lot of families there and for the most part it felt like info overkill for people not gathering data to write a thesis.
__label__1	This Dunkin is staffed with idiots. I have a food allergy and was extremely clear about my order and my allergy (they even repeated it back to me) and was given the wrong item. This could have ended up causing a serious reaction.
__label__5	Awesome! I went here for a sub yesterday for the first time. This is now my go to place. Friendly service, reasonable priced and great food. Highly recommend. Theirs subs are huge. The large could feed 3 people.
__label__5	I give these guys 5 stars. Pretty sure its the best burger in stl. I love the fast casual set up and the variety in choice for burgers be 1-2, or even 3 patties. Its the perfect juicy burger for any day of the week it is crispy, flavorful, fresh, and if you want a little flair they have other options besides just a plain cheeseburger. Their fries pair really well so I go here if I ever want a burger, you wont be disappointed. Did i mention you can get the redhot spicy fries!?? Yummm.
__label__5	"Always great service and food no matter what time I go to Hong Kong Diner. Never a long wait either:) favorites are the spicy crispy chicken, war won ton soup is the best- a lot in this soup. Best I've had in town!!! and hot pot combination is amazing they are open until 3:30 am which is perfect for swing shift workers or night owls looking for an authentic Asian
Late night meal
Thanks
Kate"
__label__4	Def hole in the wall dive in the middle of downtown. Service was pretty good food was also pretty good I felt like it was just a soils 4 star good but not quite amazing. Good selection we tried app sampler panang curry red curry and drunken noodles all where just a solid 4 stars.
__label__4	"Great neighborhood coffee shop.

Things are decently priced- hooray for day old bagels at half price!

Wireless internet is pretty slow and not too reliable.  It can get a little crowded, but there's usually a seat.  Great place for meeting, doing some work, or getting a quick cup on the go.

(never been to a concert so no-comment on that)"
__label__5	I'm so glad I finally tried this place! The bread is fresh and the lunch meat is fresher!! Wow! I'm only occasionally craving a cold sandwich and today I was so I decided to walk over a try this place. WOW. I am satisfied! I got turkey and Swiss on a Kaiser roll with some lettuce, tomato and oil and vinegar.  My dog was going nuts of the smell of the sandwich when I brought it home-so you know it was good! I will definitely be back here especially as prices are reasonable for such a fresh deli!
__label__1	So disappointed. My boyfriend basically just had a bed of rice for for his jambalaya. My coffee was burnt my salad was not nearly.close to costing 9 dollars. It just basically.sucked. we left hungry and went and ate at a few other place's. Don't go here
__label__1	"Incompetent management. Delivery was  an hour and 15 minutes late, scheduled an hour and a half in advance. Total trash. 

They told me the delivery driver was trying to call me saying they were here when they weren't even on the way with the order yet. How?! 

Yes it's super bowl and yes it's busy but they should have staffed extra drivers. Like I said, incompetent, lying management."
__label__5	Absolutely adorably magical little place  they have decorated for Halloween  The cakes and confections looked and tasted amazing as always and everything sparkles  They have a room in the back for private parties and outdoor seating as well. There is also a bar you can sit at and watch the bakers at their work! A fun treat for anyone wanting something sweet
__label__5	My gel manicure has lasted the longest I've EVER had. Not sure what kind of magic they use at Tina's but I love it!
__label__5	A W E S O M E !!!!!! We absolutely loved the food and the service was great! I had their famous shrimp and grits, YOU NEED TO ORDER THIS! It was so good! Hubby had a burger, which was really yummy and the kids had traditional breakfast (eggs, bacon and toast). Everything was well cooked and tasty.
__label__5	If you know me, you know that TJ Maxx is one of my favorite stores of all time. This location is one of my go-to stores to visit. They always have a good selection of handbags, jewelry, and clothing; I can pretty much find something new and exciting each week.
__label__5	Stop here to stalk my little cousin on her new job and actually tried some of their cuisine and to my surprise it was AMAZING. I tired the Mac & cheesy which is macaroni and cheese cooked with 4 different cheeses and bacon served on Texas toast my side was sweet potatoe fries (my fav). I definitely will be back to try other mouth watering menu items sooner than later
__label__5	First time ordering from here.Food was great! Service was good.The guy at the counter was very polite.
__label__5	We've been coming here for many years and the changes they've made have only made things better. Outdoor dining, new menu, friendly staff. So nice to have a wide array of offerings in a non-chain restaurant.
__label__5	"What can I say but fantastic!!! Awesome flavors abound at this humble but robust BYOB in the middle of Main Street Manayunk.

The service is always polite and speedy, the dishes come out as completed and creates the feel of a multi-course meal. 

Highly recommended for romantic dinners or anytime for evening of delight! 

Dan Dan Noodles, String Beans and Ground Pork, Double-Fried Fish, Chili-Oil Steamed Dumplings, or the Bok-Choy with Garlic!! All Excellent!!

 Enjoy!!"
__label__5	Love this little place!! Food is delicious, portions are great, and the price is right! I always get the Cashew Chicken which is amazing! It's very clean on the inside and there are cute little seats by the window you can sit at. Great place to go when you're in the mood for something affordable, delicious, and fast. The wait is never long at all.
__label__5	Awesome crispy potatoes (needed just a touch of salt), baby zucchini was amazing (tender/juicy). Pizza was thin, crispy and full of flavor. Awesome find on vacation.
__label__5	"First time ordering from Marco's.
Ordering was easy, via their website, which updates you with your order's progress. 
Our food was delivered in under 30 minutes & it was piping hot! That never happens. Pizza delivery always takes FOREVER. 
It is also incredibly delicious - we ordered cheese bread, chicken dippers, & an XL Chicken Florentine, with garlic butter crust. Every bite tastes fresh and awesome!"
__label__2	Food was fantastic, but I'm positive we were charged double on a couple items. we didn't realize until the following day, and had tossed the receipt otherwise we would've gone back to fix the payment. I mentioned this to a friend and they didn't seem surprised about our overpayment. Oh well.
__label__5	Run don't walk to this place! Great music, delicious good, amazing ambiance. Tourists, this is the place you want to be. It's authentic, charming, and worth coming out to the middle of nowhere for.
__label__5	If you over charge me, like you did today, & I knew it.....you won't get a tip. Be fair, do what's right....I'm watching...geez!
__label__4	I prefer this Westin to the Calgary version. Rooms are nice, staff seem more proficient. Also love the close proximity to Sherlock Holmes pub!
__label__5	"Second time that Ella did my hair and she does a fantastic job. 
Both  times, I had a wash, blow out straight and a little trim and my hair came out really, really, great. In addition, she works efficiently, I was not there that long, and she is nice to chat with & very professional.  Longer drive than usual place but probably going here for now on."
__label__4	A nicer twist to a Mexican restaurant is how I would describe mikado. The guacamole is ok, could use some spice and maybe cilantro, but other than that the food is quite awesome. Our waitress, Elizabeth, could not have been nicer. The overall experience was enjoyable. I would defiantly come back.
__label__5	"Amy and her team are the best in the neighborhood. I just met Summer, who is so creative and lovely.
She was so awesome, her customer service skills are great. She did a really lovely design on my nails for a good price.
The place is all redone and it looks amazing. Amy has always been the best, she has been doing my hair for a long time.
I love this place and would recommend it to anyone looking for great customer service and great skill!"
__label__5	Super fast service great food highly recommend this place if you're in the area especially if you like chicken tenders and really good coleslaw
__label__5	Guys. Guyssssss. I'm so glad I went to Indy microblading. I did a years worth of research. I stalked insta for the perfect brows. I got them! I chose Ali, and I am so happy I did. I get so many compliments on my brows. The salon is super clean, and very professional. It may cost more than other salons, it's so worth it. You get brows that are mapped for your face, no short cuts. Thank you, Ali
__label__3	"I love coming to this place...  It's an one of a kind experience.  Food is good as long as you like steak and an exceptional salad bar.  The only bad thing about this place is getting seated, the hosts always have a really bad attitude, I always feel like am bothering them.  I've never been asked how amI doing or how can they help.  Today was: ""Do you have a reservation?""...   My only though was "" Good day to you too""...  Once you are passed that, you are in for a treat!!"
__label__4	"Brunch here is delicious and low key in a hip downtown setting. I had the steak and eggs with the most wonderful chimmichuri sauce with ""smashed"" hash browns. Steak was cooked to perfection. Great runny, fried egg on top. I also had the classic mimosa. Would recommend to others who are looking for a more low key brunch."
__label__5	Absolute 5 star experience. Ordered from delivery and it arrived 45 minutes later. Really friendly delivery guy - arrived with a hot pizza and called to let us know when he left. The supreme hand tossed crust was amazing. More flavorful than most supremes I've eaten - it was like they seasoned the actual pizza itself. Had both the Apple Bourbon BBQ and Buffalo sauce, the chicken was tender and not overcooked, and the wings weren't overly crispy and didn't have any breading, which was nice. We'll be ordering again soon.
__label__5	The GM was welcoming and very pleasant, and our waitress Kylie were totally awesome. Our food was excellent, and the service was supurb. My wife and I highly recommend and it was our first time here
__label__3	"I went here right after i was sized at Nordstrom's. Was asked a few times if i needed help and staff was polite even when i spaced out while waiting in line.

Only qualm i have about this store is that the fitting room mirrors have stickers that are grossly in the way of a reflection. I had to sit on the floor in order to see how i looked in the bras."
__label__5	My usual barber Mariay wasn't in today so I had Luis cut my hair! He did an amazing job and was very considerate and precise with how I wanted my hair cut. Thank you Luis!!!
__label__5	Amazing food and atmosphere!! Loved everything about this place will be returning soon and many more times! Need more locations! Lol
__label__5	Excellent!!  I had the SoCal burrito and it was great! The sauce used was tasty and it came out too hot to handle.  I'd definitely return.
__label__1	Ordered a carnitas burrito ($7.85).  She put literally 3 small cubes of pork in the burrito.  I ask for more meat, she throws one more piece in. Added cheese sauce.  Total $13.15!  The cheese I knew was extra and was ok with it, but they charged me $3 extra for literally ONE additional bite of pork!  And the normal amount of meat is 3 pieces!?  What a joke.  Never again.
__label__4	Great ice cream with a nostalgic feel. The lines move pretty fast. It's a great spot for dessert during the summer months in STL.
__label__5	Local Nashville knowledge, real estate technical expertise, and FUN could not be wrapped up in a better package!  I have huge respect for Brian and highly recommend him if you are looking to buy or sell in the Nashville area.
__label__3	Good burgers, passable sushi, lots of beers.  Seats are benches without backs, and you back up to the people at the next table ... a little uncomfortable if you plan to stay long, or if the table behind you is full of roaring drunks who invade your space.
__label__1	"Stayed here during the COVID-quarantine and was horrified to find that we had been given a room that hadn't been cleaned/serviced. We followed up with management and were told we'd get the points for the night back, but never ended up getting a follow up. Called and left messages for the property manager and haven't heard back.

Extremely disappointed by the safety measures taken during COVID/Quarantine"
__label__4	For brunch, Bloody Mary bar is cool. Had blackened shrimp with smoked Gouda grits- very good. Portions are ok. Service was very good. Based on the wait- many agree this is a very good, almost great, restaurant.
__label__1	I got wings from here yesterday and they were disgraceful! Not only were they outrageously price but they weren't even sauced! There was barely any in the package!
__label__5	I'm never disappointed when I come here! The food is always flavorful and delicious. I'm a vegetarian and enjoy all of the options they have for me.
__label__1	"STAY AWAY FROM DEFENDER SECURITY AN UNPROFESSIONAL HIGH PRESSURE SALES THAT WILL VIOLATE YOUR PRIVACY BY DOING AN UNAUTHORIZED CREDIT CHECK!!!!!  

Defender Security ran an unauthorized hard inquiry on my credit. They did not get my last 4 of my SS# or permission to look into my credit. Mihaela #18885 was an extremely high pressure sales person that did not take ""no"" for an answer. They deserve ZERO stars and ADT should be ashamed to have Defender Security representing their company. If you are looking for ADT call their direct number 866-748-9164."
__label__5	This place is amazing, and it saved my skin. I had acne and scar problems throughout my life. And this place did everything it could to help reduce my scars from acne. So far a lot of my friends and family noticed a big difference after having my treatment done here. My skin feels smooth and my complexion is more even. I had micro-needling and chemical peels done here. The place is very spacious and clean. And everyone in the staff is friendly and helpful. I recommend giving this place a visit.
__label__4	I love the coffee here, and I love their food too! The staff can be a little stand-offish at first, but they're much better here than at their chesterfield location. The environment is a little bit loud, so I wouldn't try to study here if I were you, but it's a great place to get lunch or meet with friends.
__label__5	"We have stayed here many times and watched the new owners renovate this park. It is in a great location, well kept, super clean, and the staff is amazing. 

They have done a fantastic job!"
__label__2	First off we had to wait over 25 minutes to get our order on a weekday. Unacceptable! Then when we received our order my waffle was cold and looked like it had been stepped on. Not to mention the bacon was ice cold. Highly recommend not coming here unless you want to wait an unreasonable amount of time for a floppy and limp waffle.
__label__5	I can't stop thinking about these tamales. It's been more than six months since I've visited, but every tamale I've had since just hasn't been as good. I can't wait to come back to St. Louis!
__label__5	All I can say, this is my new place.  Spicy grilled tacos were smacking.  Sorry Taco Bus you gotta go.
__label__1	This gym is filthy and not well kept. Machines are broken and there's hair and dirt all over the floors. I would not go back!
__label__5	"Great food!!! Wine,beer, and liquor selection will more than cover your needs!!!

And did I mention the food?

Chef David kicks booty and takes names!!!

Standard menu plus amazing daily offerings!!!"
__label__5	Fantastic experience at Allure. Dip is consistent and lasts longer than two weeks as I tend to stretch my nail jobs for as long as I can. I think I had the best pedicure of my life as I passed out in the chair. The scrub and attention to detail was already great but the lavender body mask on my calves and feet was so relaxing I couldn't hold my eyes open any longer. I'm happy with the quality and the overall experience. Just missed having a glass of wine
__label__1	Worst hospital ever I waited 4hours to be seen and some nasty nurse said to everyone in the waiting room we needed to wait 4 hours more.. this workers in here don't care about how much pain you have or health issues because at the end of the day they still get paid regardless ... end of the story I never got seen worst experience ever maybe the health district needs to take a visit  who knows how many people had die here waiting to be seen
__label__5	I am very picky about the Italian food here in Indianapolis as it is generally pretty subpar.  However, in Maialina downtown has added another great option aside Iozzo's.  I had the sausage pasta dish which had a great kick from the crushed red pepper.  My father had the pesto ravioli which was tasty and very filling.  The house wines were both delicious and very inexpensive.  I was too full to have dessert, but I am hoping to try it next time!
__label__4	"Excellent green curry, excellent Vietnamese spring rolls, friendly service. Last year they were pretty good, this year really good. 
The atmosphere is relaxed, the place is clean. 
We'll make this a regular place for lunch or dinner."
__label__3	Read thru a ton of reviews and decided to go ahead and order dinner. The rolls were okay but the tuna tataki and the tuna sashimi were not good at all. The tuna was fatty and very disappointing.
__label__4	White castle heaven!  I don't have one close to me but it like a dirty little sin on vacation.  The buns were over cooked but always a treat.
__label__5	Decided to stop by one evening after work to check it out. Was greeted and served by a pleasant young lady, Ashley. She suggested the cinnamon breadsticks...they were AMAZING and so was the small pizza. I'll definitely go back.
__label__2	I was underwhelmed by my experience at Tortilla Press. I was told the wait was only 20 minutes, but really it was over an hour. The food took a long time to come out and it was served cold. For the price I expected much better food and service. I will not be returning to this glorified Taco Bell.
__label__3	"Love the decor. Love the large bottles of water. 

The fried green tomatoes were amazing!  

The Po boy sandwich was fair. Way too much bread. Dry! My boys 10 and 13 didn't like the MAC and Cheese on the kids menu. 

My wife got the Apple salad and enjoyed it. The desert was good but then it's rare that it isn't. 

Right across the street from the Eastern Pennsylvania penitentiary and a Public parking lot."
__label__4	Chicken prepared and fried in front of your eyes. 20 wings or combo pieces, a huge portion of piping hot fries, and a 2 ltr soda for $20. Giant deli dill pickle for 99 cents. Not sure what they coat the chicken with, maybe just cornmeal and some spices? But the frying is sooo yummy. If you're not calling ahead, be prepared to wait at least 20 min so they can cook your food. For to go orders, they pack it up nicely so it stays hot on your commute. #yum #ReviewsByRL
__label__5	"Like every IKEA, this one carries the full range of household items and needs. Don't pass up the kitchen furnishings and utensils! Everything from food storage bins,  pots and pans, kitchen decor,  and kitchen knives is a great price and will fulfill your every kitchen need! A unique part of this IKEA that I haven't seen at others is a ""fill your own bag"" of Swedish gummies and treats. Get a little of each for your drive home :)"
__label__4	We are from California and wanted to try  this restaurant out. I'm Mexican and I always like to see how the food is compared to mine. It was very good. Margaritas were also very good. We got a pitcher of margaritas and it was perfect for 4 people.
__label__2	What happened Rossis to your great pizza and great wings?My family and I ordered from here last night and the wings were overcooked and the pizza wasn't all the way cooked threw. Needless to say I was very disappointed. We ordered 20 wings and they charged us for two seperate orders therefore making it a 30 dollar meal. Sorry but I will not be returning.
__label__5	"What a great experience. I was seated immediately as the lunch rush had just finished. I had an excellent server by the name of Brian. He was exceptionally attentive and personable throughout the experience. The restaurant was very clean. It took less than 5 min. For my hot food to come out after I ordered! I had the Rosemary Chicken sandwich and some of the most amazing Tomato Basil soup! 
I will ask for Brian(who only works mainly during lunch) everytime!"
__label__5	Wow! I was surprised how delicious the food was. I had the chorizo sausage and it was the best. My boyfriend had the bandeja montañera (chorizo, steak, pork, beans, and egg). Everything tasted fresh and full of flavor. We also had the empanadas with hot sauce which blew me away! We also had flan which was okay. I highly recommend this place for the quality of the food, service, and the price was reasonable.
__label__5	Excellent find!  Seafood was prepared perfectly!   Would recommend to anyone looking for fresh seafood this is the place!  Melissa was outstanding!
__label__5	I contacted Amber a few years back to show me some homes to buy. She was punctual and patience. Although I didn't buy the house from her (my wife used a client of hers to show us more homes), Amber remained professional and reminded me if I ever needed anything else, she'd still be happy to help.  The no stress, no pressure service is what I appreciate about her even after we bought a home with another realtor. I definite recommend someone with these morals and ethics.
__label__1	I used to love it here. It SUCKS big time. On line does not say that seat's are low. What a waste of time and gas.
__label__4	I have visited mod pizza quite a few times. This is one of my new favorite restaurants. The food is reasonable price and every time I have visited this location the people were friendly and welcoming. The food is fresh and I love that it is made right in front of me.
__label__1	Owners ended up being unfriendly to the point of being rude to us. We really liked this place at one time but sometimes placed just can't keep that friendly appeal. The husband is always yelling from the kitchen about something totally unprofessional. Everything they make I and my wife like we've learned to make ourselves. Some places go out of business or just make it harder on themselves for some season.
__label__4	Good breakfast place. Skillet was good and home fries are red skins and pretty good. They serve lunch also but haven't tried that yet.
__label__5	Holy moly!!! Had the brownie cheesecake and it was amazing!! I usually struggle with cheesecake being too heavy and too rich but this was perfection!!
__label__5	We were looking for a good meal at the end of a long week.  Figured Caribbean food would hit the spot.  The surprise was the food that was amazing, a great staff, and a beautiful ambiance. Definitely will return to the new gem we found.  Don't let the location fool you - this is fine dining with heart warming comfort food.
__label__4	High end shopping in New Orleans. While this mall seems to cater to tourists, it does have a nice selection of stores. Mostly targeted toward women. For guys, it has one of the best lleather-goods around and also an Allen Edmonds shoes. Food court is mediocre at best. The Saks here is probably one of the best and largest in the country.
__label__5	Hit a deer and had to get headlight and front end  fixed - Luke did amazing job- price was very fair and work was quick - car looks new - highly recommend - thank you
__label__2	At first I liked it a lot. Now I go there and have to wait way too long for just coffee and a muffin early in the morning. Only one person waiting on you doing everything. So you wait why she rings them up and then get their things ready. After waiting in line it was 4 minutes after 10 and she said I could not get breakfast even though I was there waiting my turn. Not very friendly and customer service not good.
__label__4	West Tampa Sandwich Shop is a small restaurant that's big on value. Pictures line the wall of celebrities and locals that have dined at this West Tampa icon for decades. Nothing fancy about it but make no mistake, the food is amazing. Keep in mind they are only open for breakfast and lunch. Enjoy!
__label__4	I have tried almost everything on  the menu at The Food Liaison. The chicken crack is not a personal favorite because they seem to have some issues under cooking their Quinoa. The blackened chicken, which I attached a photo of, is my absolute favorite dish out of everything that they offer.
__label__3	Went to Jonathan's Grill in Mount Juliet Tennessee for the first time. It wasn't quite what I expected. We have a really long wait for food to come out. When our food came out we had no silverware, so our waitress went to another table that had a huge party and grabbed some on wrapped silverware and brought them to our table. Of coarse we refuse that and asked for different silverware. The only saving grace for three stars on this is when the food came out it was really good. If I have a choice I probably would not go back.
__label__5	The Fishhawker is the perfect breakfast; it has a little of everything you could want for a solid meal to start your day.  Including French Toast which is so addictive...it gives you that good feeling when you bite into a freshly made warm donut.
__label__3	It has improved over the years. More restaurants Andy people. The hotel is expensive. Not like Vegas. It is a nice evening and the restaurants and clubs have improved for a nice Saturday the hotel is great for a late night with nice rooms.
__label__2	"This review is for the Gas Station portion of Flying J only. 

While the price may seem right, the service at the gas station at this location is consistently bad. I've sat here several times for 5+ minutes after my pump clicked off waiting for someone to come complete the sale. Do yourself a favor and go across the street to the Valero - better, faster service and comparable prices."
__label__5	Pizza and steaks are terrific. My favorite is large pie with sausage. As an added bonus to the Excellent and fairly priced food is that the guys who run the place are very nice
__label__1	Unbelievably poor service from Ass't mgr. Angelique- they fixed a cracked screen on cell phone and completely broke the phone. Would do nothing at all to rectify situation. Had to replace my phone (that worked fine) at Verizon. I'm out $400.
__label__5	You had me at vegan, but adding comfort food and gluten free, genius. Super nice interior. Friendly staff. Baked goods and a espresso bar. I'm in heaven. Lunch of chipotle panini, side salad, and double shot americano. Fantastic!  Can't wait for desert!
__label__5	Some of the best food that I've had while in the Big Easy! Had the alligator poor boy and gumbo. Absolutely great! Highly recommend stopping in for some of the best food in New Orleans.
__label__1	Long time customer just brought home a pizza with half pepperoni and half mushroom. Total of six pepperoni on one half and somewhat more mushrooms on the other dispersed unevenly. Crust like cardboard. But the reason for this review is that they had 8 employees doing various functions in a very small space without a single mask on or any gloves on their hands. As a senior citizen at risk, I will never visit again and risk my life for a pizza. Every employee at the local Burger King wears a mask and has plastic gloves respecting a serious pandemic and caring about their patrons safety.
__label__4	Visited on a beautiful spring day & our dog had a blast. We visited the under 32lb section. They had an over 32lb section as well as a service dog section. Most people observed the rules except for those that had a small & big dog. I saw two droppings (one fresh) that people hadn't cleaned up but not everywhere. Your dog might need a bath afterwards because there is a lot of dirt patches. Looks like they try to mulch them but some are bare. We will revisit this park though it would be nice if parking was free.
__label__4	It's a nice chill spot to drink beer. They have good selection of beer and no matter what beer you get, they all taste good and are well brewed. The only thing is that the food is ok, not great. I had the smoked and blackened chicken tacos and the chicken did not have any flavor and the fries did not taste fresh. I am giving the place a high rating because the beer is really good
__label__5	I love the cute bow tie decor, the frosted glass bathroom door (opaque for your private moments) and there is a towel rack (it's in the shower and the towels don't get wet when used). Bathroom was the perfect size for my BF and I to share the space. If the cute bow tie on the mirror gets in your way, you can always move to the huge mirror in bedroom area. The courtyard is beautiful and the service is GREAT, as always. It's a quiet and quaint hotel, unlike the usual W Hotels, perfect place to escape from the Bourbon street crowd.
__label__5	"This place is sooooo good!!! I've been here multiple times and their food is just excellent!!

Ordered their Torta and Carne asada burrito and both were really good. The salsa was perfect. Not too spicy. 

Great flavor at a great price.

Customer service was good. 

Stop by this place today and have a great day!"
__label__5	This is a new favorite place! Received a great manicure from Henry. Nail salon is beautiful and clean. I loved that I didn't have to wait forever to be seen.
__label__2	Great service and great prices.  This used to be the best Pho in town.  Now the family that runs the place did not grow up making pho.  The broth used to be world class.  Now they only use chicken stock.  Everyone is super nice and the food is cheap.  Unfortunately this family does not have a history of pho broth.  Not sure how to say this tactfully.  This is like ordering pho South of the border.  Did I say the service and prices are great.
__label__5	So wife and I came with friends to a family event at this wonderful restaurant. What a surprise. The ambiance and atmosphere of the place was great. Our waiter was really awesome and attentive. I ordered the veal Marsala and was amazing. I don't often find this dish done right but it was fabulous. My compliments to the chef. My wife had a shrimp dish that blended a little heat and it was amazing. I ate two of them and wish I had ordered more.  So after eating at many great Italian restaurants around the globe I would suggest that you try this local hit.
__label__4	Food and the wait service was excellent.  Nice atmosphere in the restaurant , the restrooms could use some freshening up.  I will definitely return to this place when I'm in town.
__label__4	I'll be honest with you - I come here for the bacon cheddar pancakes (what more can you ask for, really?). Always busy, but has consistently good food and service!  A varied menu for all the picky eaters in your group.
__label__4	"I love this place and the beers are awesome!!! The only problem is the wait. We went on a Saturday about 6:30 and were told there was over a 3 hour wait!! That's ridiculous!!! But the whole bar area is ""seat yourself"", so we scouted out a table there. The food was great and so was the beer. I would go back, but I'd probably make reservations next time."
__label__5	Keratin cut & color- master stylist Sean makes magic happen!  Loved our conversation & end product is a more stylish me.  Literally feel like s hottie .  I am so particular & loved his choice in music, & decor.  Magazines are cutting edge.  Salon coordinator Sharon had me rolling with laughter too!
__label__5	We have eaten at the Maloney's in Carollwood, several times now and have always had awesome service and great food! We like the variety of menu items and especially like their grouper sandwich (very fresh fish), wings and the Shepard's Pie (order it with cheese) was out of this world!! Service was outstanding, bartender great and very nice manager. Our family will definitely continue to dine here when in Tampa!
__label__5	Had a wonderful date with my daughter. Food was great, it was busy but not loud for a Friday night. We'll definitely be back...and ask for Paisley! She took care of us to the nines.
__label__5	The Burnt Ends, Brussel Sprouts, Cabbage Slaw, Carrots, and the Cauliflower are amazing. Great meal and awesome service. Will definetly be back!!!
__label__4	"Hungry and desperate on E. Grant! Thank you, Molcas, for being open earlier than anyone else for dinner. Your asada torta (toasted bun! The mark of civilization.) with avocado slices was delish, and your strange ""burro"" (strange to San Francisco eyes, anyway) hit the spot. And we adore your condiments bar, especially your roasted whole jalapenos, your red onion slices, and your runny, Oaxacan-style guac.

Thank you for the dinner save!"
__label__4	What better excuse to meet up with friends than $2 margaritas and guacamole? This place is great for meeting up with friends or family, and has a variety of options from mild to spicy. The margaritas were great and the service was friendly and efficient.
__label__4	Michael has another solid winner in his portfolio.  Similar dishes as Sugos with a few family new recipes.  Only ding is the decor.  It was very spartan with somewhat cheap art work and a strange folding table/serving station in the middle with a white table cloth on top.  The place needs a little more attention and perhaps some acoustic improvement.  I not sure I'd travel from West county here instead i would just visit Sugos in Frontenac.
__label__5	"I'll definitely stay here again. The hotel was nice and clean very new! 

It was during the Covid-19 pandemic so breakfast was limited to ""grab-n-go"" which I was not impressed with and the coffee had some chunks of coffee grounds in it but hey... it was during a pandemic and the hotel was VERY clean and nice so they still get 5 stars! Next time there better be some good coffee and edible breakfast though. Hahaha"
__label__5	Just had the premier chimney sweep, Joe, from Your Chimney Sweep out for his biennial chimney inspection.  He and his assistant were efficient, capable, honest and friendly.  Joe has schooled me in proper fireplace do's and don't's. This being my first fireplace, I have been grateful.  His no-nonsense, with a hint of humour, demeanor has been appreciated.  Thanks for a job well done.
__label__1	"Stay away from this target!!! I did self checkout and only purchased a birthday card, as I am walking away one of the workers come up to me and says, "" Wait a minute I don't think you got both items "" and then she checks the machine and looks in my bag and says "" oh that's the receipt? Ok you're good"". 
Are you serious Target!! Of course she was white and I'm Puerto Rican... Really?!!!
Wow! Just Wow!"
__label__5	The vibe and decor serve IV perfectly. If you do get a chance, ask for Mason. He's a perfectionist, my hair turned out to be better than I hoped. Needless to say I'm definitely coming back.
__label__1	"DO NOT GO TO THE DELI
The lady literally put chicken fat on my sandwich because they ran out of turkey. Did not put down a sheet while making sandwich and counter was disgusting. Lettuce she used was brown and limp. Definitely not like the Safeway back home. Will not return"
__label__5	Everything on the menu sounded delicious! I opted for the cheeseburger and a loaded baked potato which was tasted great. It was cooked medium to perfection with sharp cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato, red onions and pickle coins. I would definitely recommend this choice. I look forward to visiting again. The service was also great, with very accommodating staff.
__label__1	"No. I tried to treat some of my family from Texas... it was embarrassing. :-( Our server was rude, the food was less than impressive, and their ""authentic"" menu included a section called ""For The Gringo."" Not cool."
__label__1	"Someone one day is going to have to fill me in on what is so great about this place; is it the snot nosed lil hostesses that do not know how to take reservations, the fact that food runners like to pass hot skillets (the kitchen sink breakfast menu) over your head, or maybe it's the fact that they are too cheap to pay for a credit card machine? Food is ok I only do take out now since the servers at the No Libs location are too bust talking to this one moron bus boy than making sure your $15 pancakes get to
Your table while they are hot."
__label__4	I from Michigan so Of course I was excited when they opened one here in Indy!! Great products. Coffee is amazing balls!! The only area of improvement would be time. Most ppl are on the way to work and just don't have 20-30 mins to spare in the morning. Speed is a huge factor for any coffee shop. Once improved, they will be a five star company all the way!!
__label__1	There was a hair in the salsa, yuck!  Won't be back to this place.  It's expensive for Mexican food and the quality is just ok.
__label__2	Came in to the mall and bought 20$ worth of cookies as you know isn't hard to do at this place gave them a 50$ bill as the smallest bill I had waited 20 mins for a manager to come check the bill, and once she arrived she was a dogs ass about it like she was put out!!! Won't be back to this one again!!!
__label__2	Called my order in told me it would take 15, turned out to be 30 they didn't prepare my food until I paid. What's the use of calling in an order.  Customer service is lacking especially from the owner, no smile, non welcoming personality.  I said strike one, but I definitely won't be back.  Macaroni and cheese had no flavor, barely had cheese.   Remember BJ's you grew up in the hood too.
__label__3	"best happy hour hands down...

3 to 6 pm...

the bartender will treat you like a cheap bastard...

the price and quality make up for the poor treatment by the bartender...

overall as good as it gets for chain happy hours..."
__label__5	Longwood's Christmas is a fantastic night out for all ages! Leave yourself plenty of time - a few hours - to see everything. Baileys Hot Chocolates are a must!
__label__1	Can't figure out what's going on with these people. Used to eat here very frequently pre-COVID and always enjoyed my meals there. They've supposedly reopened for takeout only, but in three days of constantly trying to reach them, they've literally never picked up the phone in over a dozen attempts. If you're unreachable by phone and don't take online orders or use any of the standard delivery apps, what good are you in this pandemic era? Oh, well. Time to find a new source for Thai in Northwest Reno, I guess.
__label__4	"Small cozy spot decent local beer lineup and close to other bars makes it a good pit stop. Punk type vibe, def appreciate the street art on canvas: ""life is beautiful""."
__label__1	"Rip off artists!  We overheated on the freeway from out of town and AAA towed us to this ""recommended"" mechanic, so we were stuck.  They admitted to charging 3 times what they paid for the part ($140 more) and said it was legal and they could do whatever they wanted.  They were rude and unprofessional.  We have reported them to AAA and BBB, so hope they lose their license.  DO NOT GO HERE!"
__label__4	This a fun spot to visit with great outdoor seating. Staff are friendly and the device is quick. There's not much special about the menu but a secret tip: if ordering sweet potato fries, ask for the whiskey bourbon sauce. This is the sauce they use on the bread pudding and pairs Amazingly with the sweet potato fries! It's practically a dessert!
__label__2	Price is right with Millionaire's discount. Has a shuttle which I haven't used yet. I got stuck on 2nd level back-corner mouse maze. Up down and around. Front desk was helpful and courteous. No restaurants in the area to walk to. A rental car is a must, which I don't have. beds were comfy and hotel quiet. Exec lounge lacks amenities. Fitness center is average.
__label__5	Dr. Cohen and the entire team are always friendly, attentive, proactive and highly-skilled. I've been taking my dog to Center City Vet for years and I highly recommend it to anyone in search of excellent, high-quality care!
__label__4	I haven't eaten in, only gotten delivery once and takeout twice.  I'm really pleased with their food, it's the classic Chinese takeout taste that I am always looking for.  The hot and sour potatoes are something I've never seen before on the menu and now a new favorite.  I've ordered something different every time, and so far, no disappointments.  Please note that you have to *ask* for steamed rice on the side.
__label__5	This business is amazing. Took a mother of bride dress and my daughter took a bridesmaid dress there to be hemmed and altered.  Both fit perfectly. Great service and finished in a timely fashion. I refer others to them too.
__label__5	"Everytime I come it's a positive experience from the atmosphere to the ingredients. G's pizza is a great option family, coupled up, or single. 
Shout out to the manager there. Thanks for the love and excellent service everytime I come by. Please keep doing what you're doing! Love the food, the specials and the customer service.  You just feel comfortable there."
__label__3	"Three stars for great service and decent food.  Certain dishes could be better.  Don't order the chicken hash since it is really just tiny pieces of potatoes and two small sliver of chicken for $11. Not their star dish.  The mushroom soup was flavorful.

Coffee is local and too light for preference."
__label__4	"No more food? 

I was there just last year. The desserts are amazing, especially the chocolate cuban cigar with candy matches. 

The atmosphere is amazing and chic. Almost an European (because of the lounges) feel but more Cuban. Less music than Bongos!"
__label__5	"This was among the finest meals we've ever had. Sublime food via the incredible tasting menu as well as perfect wine pairings for each course and often two per course. We've been here before and this meal was even more incredible than we remember our prior ones. Everything about Vetri is truly perfect. It is a special place. Be warned though, this perfection comes with an equally incredible price tag. We feel guilty spending this much on a dinner for two but if you seek a ""once in a lifetime culinary experience"", Vetri is unparalleled!"
__label__1	First watch is my favorite breakfast chain.  However the Trinity location is terrible.  The service is slow,  dishes weren't clean,  food arrived cold.  We've tried this location twice hoping the experience would get better but it gets worse.
__label__5	This place has amazing breakfast and customer service. So modern and fresh everything. Highly recommended!
__label__3	A few work colleagues and I stopped in for lunch on a whim.  Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their meal.  I had the Gui Lin Style noodle soup with BBQ pork.  Nice! No complaints.  The pickled flavour element is very unique.  I've since returned and tried the BBQ  pork vermicelli.  The service is friendly and quick! They also sell chilli sauce in mason jars, which is a nice take home treat.
__label__3	The hot chicken was good and appropriate for Nashville hot chicken. They get three stars for the lack of sides. How about some cole slaw? The  potato salad was good, but I didn't really want the baked beans. I ordered the baked beans because none of the other sides appealed.
__label__4	We came here on our first night in Orleans.  The service and food was really good. I didn't know it was connected to a hotel. will visit again.
__label__4	Gotta love the ambiance of a streetcar touring the Garden District mansions. Very crowded this day with tourists but patience will eventually met a seat as cars run every 20 minutes+\-  it's an old but trendy mode of transport and adds significant charm to this charming city.  Of course, sometimes they get 'clumped' together and run every 2-3 minutes - which means you might wait an hour, though they do try to re-space the intervals. Lots to see in this quaint city.  Many great bars & eateries 'Uptown' at River Bend as well.
__label__4	"its Ironic that my least favorite dish was the cochon. It was very dry & flavorless.
On the plus side:
+++Alligator w/ aioli dip was DELICIOUS !
+++Special of the day : Whole fish w/ pesto sauce
++++++Dessert : Upside down pineapple with coconut sorbet = very interesting well balanced flavors :)"
__label__5	Sweet staff and great donuts! Actually everything we had was awesome. Best in Meridian!
__label__1	If I could give zero stars I would. Totally over rated- terribly clueless receptionist and awful service. Mixed up our reservation and when we asked when our room would be ready after waiting for two hours and it was 7pm  no one had an answer. Go elsewhere- Ritz Carlton, the W, anywhere but this place. Pool is tiny and Service is awful. Spend your money time and experience elsewhere!!!
__label__5	"My wife and I had a great breakfast this morning at Majora's.  Great food, fantastic service!  The sausage was ""hot sausage"" and it was plenty hot like I love it.  Food was cooked to order and exceeded our expectations.  Well worth the visit!"
__label__5	I recently got married at the Crystal Tea Room. This venue uses Potito's to make their wedding cakes. From the beginning, I had a very clear idea of what I wanted our wedding cake to look like. At the first meeting with Potito's, we had our tasting and brought lots of pictures. Not only were all the flavors delicious, but Joe was also very knowledgeable and willing to create our wedding cake vision for us! We really extremely happy with both the taste of our cake and how it looked. Would definitely recommend Potito's!!
__label__3	They're in a hurry to get you to leave again - I hadn't finished my meal when I got the bill. Apparently the desserts and coffee is only available if you order it all from the get-go? I'm not impressed.
__label__5	Well to my elation my night was salvaged by this amazing vibes and bestest music restaurant with food that takes you on a taste journey. Thank you noodlebox will return will spend my money willingly here!!! Worth every dollar!
__label__5	So delicious and good ambience! This was my second time here....and I remembered it from 2012 and knew I had to come back! The seafood is so well done and delicate and flavorful, but the whiskey bread pudding is not to be missed. The service is friendly and attentive and the vibe in the restaurant is cozy and lively. Good date spot.
__label__5	I love this place, every time I go here the staff are really nice and help out find the best prices for things, and the prices are amazing, for example here you can buy an i7 4790k for 80$ cheaper than in newegg which is an incredible deal, and i don't know why people don't like returning things here, the line usually isn't that long and the staff there is reasonable. I recommend going here if you need PC parts because they have the cheapest prices for those.
__label__2	I really like this place and have had some enjoyable meals and drinks there, and the service is good.  But I had a dud there Sunday with the stroganoff, which is supposed to be a speciality. At $22 it should be above average but it definitely was not.  The meat was tired little pieces of beef, dry and without distinguishing favor.  The whole dish was bland and essentially flavorless. Very disappointed.
__label__5	Food and service is always so great. Outstanding BBQ, Tacos and staff. A Citrus Park gem folks!!!
__label__5	They are very friendly.  Took us right in for a Saturday afternoon emergency and only charged us $40 for him to get his anal glands expressed and nothing for the emergency or consult.  And I was shocked that he was strutting his way into the hospital and socializing with other dogs as opposed to crying and shaking violently since he really dislikes the vets office.... I couldn't believe it... He had fun!?
__label__4	Best Mexicana food around me. Better than the franchise joints. The chorizo is great. Very colorful place and not expensive. About as authentic as you're gonna get on the east coast!
__label__3	As a vegan this place was a gem. The food was definitely tasty! And I'll always recommend people to come here and try their food. But in comparison to some other ethiopian places I've had this one was mediocre. Maybe I got spoiled in california? The spices weren't as intense and the portions were smaller for a similarly priced dish. But by all means, if you're in Philly this is a reliable spot for good food.
__label__5	"Location location location. Kaldis on Kirkwood Road has location in its favor, especially on a nice day. The outdoor seating area is the best. You can hear the trains go by, use the WiFi, enjoy the coffee and feel super hip while doing your work at a chain coffee shop. 

The inside isn't too shabby either. Plenty of space. Super clean. Good service. It's one of the better Kaldis locations. 

Parking is available on the street or even better - at the free parking garage on Madison."
__label__4	"Stumbled into this Tony's because it has a nice looking storefront and was located in a trendy little main street amongst the bars.

Ordered a roast pork and cheesesteak sand, both tasted good. But the service, condiments offered, and cleanliness of the store made the experience great."
__label__5	This is a special quaint spot! The service was super nice and accommodating. The food was high quality. I'm a vegetarian and asked for alternatives and they were able to fulfill my needs! Def worth checking out for a date night!
__label__5	Yelpers didn't let me down on recommending this pizza place.  New to the area and wasn't sure where to go.  Called in our order for takeout and it was ready in no time.  They say the crust makes the pizza and this crust is fantastic.  Good amount of toppings and it was cooked perfectly.  Looking forward to heading back as they have lunch specials that looked great.  I will add the girls working there were super friendly.  Always nice to have great customer service!
__label__3	If you want friendly prompt service and in the mode for a warm yummy lunch I'd recommend this. Never dissatisfied with them. The cheese coney with mustard is amazing. Who doesn't like free oyster crackers and hot sauce too.. and of course their iconic chili sauce is great on anything :) try them out!
__label__1	This website is straight up trying to steal you car if you try to sell directly to them!  They shamelessly lied to you. They undercut the value on KBB by thousands and claim that that's a fair price! They then further reduce that price for nonexistent accidents and location fees. You'll do better donating your vehicle and getting the tax benefits then trying to sell to these thieves!
__label__4	"Went for the 1st time Saturday, what a pretty place. Greeted in a warm friendly manner and was given our choice of location, nice. Service attentive but not hovering. Food choices include salads, soups and crepes. You can't go wrong with any 
This place is reasonably priced and delivers the goods.
Date night, brunch, or anytime you are sure to enjoy"
__label__5	Hands down the best wings in Indy. Come here for a cocktail and wings, and you're in business. Great, everyone is down to earth. Love my Chas! She's the best server I know. KSR is a cornerstone in this great city. No kids allowed.
__label__2	Well this was my first experience here, I won't be back. Tables are not kept clean especially with what's going on right now. Service is super slow with several people just standing behind counter doing nothing. Drinks are all warm including adult beverages. And had to wait for 10 min for someone to cash in kids tickets.
__label__2	Read reviews and comments on Facebook so thought I would give a couple of weeks to get things figured out. Evidently that still isn't enough time. 8am and they were out of doughnuts. Figured since I was up and out and wanting doughnuts I'd head to Longs. 2 stars for getting me to go to Longs!
__label__5	Got the Tofu Pad Thai and it was amazing! Super fresh and not too oily at all. Great service and you really get what you pay for in terms of portion sizes. My meal was ~$10 and it was basically two meals worth of food for me. Definitely check this place out!
__label__5	This is one of my favorite Italian restaurants.  The food is so tasty and the service is excellent.  My husband took me here for my birthday four years ago and we have been back many times since.  If you are looking for an authentic regional Italian cuisine experience, go to Osteria.
__label__5	Shopped the Acura dealers in Ventura and the SF Bay Area.  The Santa Barbara team were just at another level in terms of professionalism, courtesy and detail knowledge about the RDX.   They offered a very fair price and outstanding delivery prep and technical training.   Sam, Tony and Nic all did a great job.  This is my second Acura from the SB group and I've been delighted with them for the past several years.   The service group under Gee has been outstanding also.   Once again, courtesy and professionalism are the key attributes
__label__5	"Fantastic food here!!

Have been here twice now and each time the flavors have been amazing with good size portions and great prices! Had an issue(ladybug in food) with my wife's meal and they handled it perfectly, refunding and remaking her dish. The staff are young and friendly. Very laid back atmosphere with cool music and unique tables. Definitely a place to try!"
__label__1	"Just called asked for a soak off and a full set...they don't ""do"" soak offs...wtf
Anyways I say I'll soak off my own nails can I get a pink & white full set, long. The man tells me that they don't do that, just simple stuff. What the F, pink & white is as simple as it gets. Beyond annoyed and disappointed. Guess they barely can do nails"
__label__3	It's ok - first time - staff is great and I love the decorations but the food really is just okay. We had kids chicken strips and fries and pretty good. They have a huge menu so I feel like this might not be a true rating but we had meatloaf, Mac cheese , mashed potatoes, bacon and biscuit gravy . All just middle of the road nothing I have to rush back to get that's for sure.
__label__5	I have had them out twice this last year, they are very reasonably priced and excellent, quick work!!
__label__5	Not only is the customer service 10/10, the food is always top notch and fast. Plenty of pescatarian, vegetarian and vegan options. You have to try their sangrias too! The outdoor seating is covid-friendly and the staff cleans tables regularly
__label__4	Great little hole in the wall place. Food was good. Try those chili dogs! Game days means slower service but all in all good prices and good food.
__label__5	"My party of 3 came here on a Thursday night and there was only another couple there. 

To start, we had the spinach artichoke dip which was pretty good. We also got the Ancona Caesar salad and the portion of that was huge. The best thing on the menu definitely has to be the margherita pizza. It's cheesy, crispy, and not greasy. 

Service was amazing. Our waitress was super friendly and attentive.

Definitely recommend this spot if you're looking for some good reasonably priced pizza."
__label__3	Great place! Decor is spot on. Service is usually good. Yes, a bit pricey but food is usually consistent. Stumptown coffee!  Music volume loud at times upstairs.. NIce people watching.
__label__5	Decided to try a new place for Sunday delivery and Bonners Irish Pub did not disappoint! I ordered the French onion soup and a bacon cheeseburger. The French onion soup was very tasty and was the perfect portion size. The bacon cheeseburger was cooked perfectly and hit the spot! I will definitely be ordering from here again.
__label__5	Simply delicious! Love the cholados! Love the people and love the little piece of Colombia in Tampa!
__label__1	"Good: Place is organized and clean, descent selections.

Bad: Prices seem to be much higher then other area stores and i found a lot of the items on amazon.com for half price of what i paid.  Also overheard owner or manager on the phone speaking very rude to another customer concerning a refund....to the point he offended me. 
Then he got off the phone and called her the B**** word and a racial profanity i won't repeat!

No reason to go back here."
__label__1	Delivery person had an attitude and was quite rude with no sense of humor. We had funny delivery instructions which clearly he wanted no part of but his demeanor about it was bull to be quite honest. Then, after receiving payment, he walked off after saying a disrespectful comment without a thank you or have a good night. Pretty much acted like he hated his job and despised customer service in general. Pizza was not that great either......this is why I usually stick with other pizza establishments as this is what I have come to expect from most Pizza Huts.
__label__3	"Had lunch there today prior to a business meeting. Service was good and very quick. I had the lunch special with coconut soup, dumplings and Phad Thai. Just the basics. 

Food was all decent and service was good. I have to say, the place absolutely reeked of cigarette smoke. Have other folks noticed this? I might be more sensitive than most, but I could have sworn I was in a bar back in the 90s."
__label__4	Not your usual donair spot but very tasty. The donair nazi guy is an edmonton institution.
__label__4	It's a diner and your expectations should be just that. I don't order the dinner items or specials because it's a bit expensive for the end product or eating in a diner (or as takeout). They they have solid diner food and service. They have the food you want to eat! Breakfast items are consistently good and fairly priced. The eggs Benedict are reported by family to be amazing! The Reuben is always a favorite. And they deliver for free! You can't beat free and quick delivery! We order from here about once a week (sometimes more often).
__label__5	OK I recommend to my sister in law and her friend. They went Saturday after my first visit Friday. She called and thanked me....she said you were right! Incredibly fresh and delicious.... The deserts she loved! You guys impressed me and honestly didn't even know of your place. Not anymore. Keep up the excellent job guys!!
__label__5	"Food was good but service was better! April was very knowledgeable and had a great warm personality. 
Will definitely be back to see Miss April!!!"
__label__5	Enjoying the beer scene in Boise.  White Dog is hands down one of the best Breweries that I have been to recently! They have gone above and beyond with their beer quality. Come on down and enjoy a pint!
__label__5	We love coming to this store. Great price on frozen rabbit, fresh beef and always well trimmed pork. Fish of course is the star of this store- always great quality. The bakery- all the goods taste and look like the bakery that used to be in china town on Olive. It's fresh and tasty. We tried the fresh cooked lunch at the store and it was delicious! I had the yung cha fried rice- great flavor, tender shrimp. My husband got a beef soup and could not stop eating it. Great place for eating in or picking up.
__label__5	"This is actually a pretty great airport. Very organized, good food options, and typically friendly employees. This airport has a TON of airline options and is pretty well organized with a shuttle-to-terminal system.
In terminal A, there is also a play area for children . The airport is clean, large, and well-lit!"
__label__3	The prices are good and my food was delicious. But the bartender is a total introvert. I always have to ask for another beer or more water in my glass. Leaves for 15 minutes at a time for a smoke. I feel like a good bartender asks if you want another beer and just automatically fills your water glass. I shouldn't have to ask him after he played on his phone for 15 minutes.
__label__5	"Calling all vegetarians!! Best veggie sausage stromboli I have ever had. Actually best sausage period.  I usually stock up because I can't get enough of it. Even my meat lover friends think it's to die for.

Great pizzas and strombolis in general, awesome healthy selection and they are the nicest people to deal with. Nothing comes close to beating it."
__label__5	The square BBQ chicken pizza is a must. Do not forget to order a side of ranch- it is AMAZING!
__label__1	A beautiful building being wasted with incompetent management and hit or miss fare. Service is painful and causes customers to get angry over the obvious lack of organization skills that cause a general sense of malaise throughout the staff. It just can't be that hard....
__label__5	Very professional,  and they are willing to go the extra mild to find solutions to your individual and personal needs.
__label__5	I've been here for 2 private parties, and they do not disappoint! Hands on with showing you how to do the moves, super friendly, sweet, and personable!! You'll wake up the next day sore, in the best possible way! This is the new way my friends and I will celebrate events, having a blast and getting in a workout!!
__label__5	"I highly recommend this Jewelry store. After months of not being able to find a jewelry store that would fix my wedding ring... I was able to fix it. I walked in to this place and was greeted by smiles and kindness. Despite them being very busy, I was able to get my wedding ring resized in a day! I'm extremely grateful for the service provided by Chuck and John. 


Thank you!!! Brenda and Joey Gillum"
__label__5	"After going here for a couple of months this place gets a 5 star rating! There is only one instructor I try to avoid because she is very rough in putting you into form but I like all the other instructors! Do the new client special and the new client step up plan to get the most for your money. I'm trying to go 5 days a week for one month...Let's see how that goes.

Up an inch, down an inch."
__label__3	This car wash is ok. I've gone three times to see if they would do a better job but they don't clean the inside of your car well.
__label__5	I wish this place was in Chicago. Half price most drafts on weekdays. Food was perfect for the price. Location was awesome. When I travel i love going to the areas removed from the tourist sections of town. This place delivered on every level.
__label__1	Tower Health in Villanova just denied COVID tests to 2 symptomatic individuals. The clinic advertises walk-ins and are for-profit. Since their money is s green s everyone else's I can deduce that the color of their skin led to such a denial. With massive testing taking place across the country there is no reason to deny a consumer the test, symptomatic or not!
__label__5	We took our dog to see Dr. Ed and our cat to see Dr. Claire. Both experiences were great.  No waiting and they clearly explained everything they were doing for both pets.  Much better than our previous doctor. Would recommend either Doctor.
__label__1	Don't get a massage here. I was charged twice- I questioned it at the time and even though I told the woman at desk it was inconvenient for me to pay in cash because I already paid online, I had to pay cash anyway. I couldn't look at my transactions at the time due to some glitch with my bank site but when I got home I saw I was charged. I called and was told I was refunded. This was Monday of last week and I still don't have my refund, which means I will have to call AGAIN. Ridiculous.
__label__4	U have to tell them u want thicker nails because they do them to thin for me but they do a good job and r super quick
__label__5	"I went there for  the first time this week and now I know what everyone is talking about. This place us legit !!
I got the Tommy roast beef sandwich and it was so juicy and delicious!! Can't wait to go back."
__label__1	"I will NEVER be back to this location. This dealership is terrible for service. The advisors are always dazed and confused and are just trying to rush you in and out. Last service I had performed here (which cost me over $600 for service B) they forgot to do an alignment I asked them to add on and installed a simple air filter backwards. I had to have Mercedes of Tampa fix it.

If you're looking for service, go elsewhere. Even with their flashy new dealership, this place has no idea what they're doing and has beyond disappointing customer service."
__label__5	Samurai Blue is our go-to for sushi date night. We always order the volcano roll and the kyoto roll. I wanted to expand our palette and selected a roll we never had before. Our server, Heather, kneeled down and discussed our roll choices. We ended up switching a roll out for one she recommended. And that roll is now a staple, right along with the volcano roll and kyoto roll. When you go in, ask for Heather. She's amazing.
__label__5	Stopped in on a Sunday for breakfast. Seated quickly, and our waitress was great. Food was served quickly and my eggs Benedict Florentine was perfect. We will return.
__label__4	This is a very very large restaurant with Spanish and local style Cuban food I had tapas, lobster croquettes, stuffed mushrooms. There is a specialty salad. I had queso fundido. I had white sangria. Ate so much and had food to spare for our group. A little expensive but this place is a must visit for Tampa tourists.
__label__1	I went here pre covid and I wouldn't return. Rude tattoo guy should learn to at least smile if he's working customer service.
__label__4	Love it! They don't trip on hydro flasks. Seat are starting to wear down a bit. Overall movies are clean, the staff is what you expect.
__label__5	I think this new restaurant is great. I have been 3 times in the last two weeks. Ask for recommendations from the owner. It would nice to see naan added to the menu, but I have enjoyed trying different types of bread that I was not familiar with. Very casual spot in a Lincoln Court shopping center.
__label__3	If your'e on a quest for the best Sazerac, you won't find it here. The bar is quaint, but the service is lackadaisical. I looked up the spelling of that word just to make sure I adquately portrayed the attitude of our bartender and the waitstaff.
__label__4	Order the Naan as soon as you sit down. It's the best compliment to all the scrumptious offerings on the buffet tables. I can't tell you what I just ate by name, but it was all delicious and obviously made with love and served with pride. Oh, and order the mango Lassi!
__label__3	Needed to fill my sweet tooth. I decided to stop here to grab a few macaroons and a truffle. The place was totally empty just the lady behind the counter. I had one raspberry macaroon, one madagascar black vanilla macaroon and one champagne truffle. They were all very good. The truffle was amazing to say the least. I do think it was a little expensive for these three tasty treats. Don't know if I would be a regular here but would definitely return.
__label__3	Ybor and Channelside locations are better. This location has consistently rude  and slimey staff.
__label__1	"ASS NOODLES

This place has ass noodles

The noodles taste like ass

Asshole
Gave me 4 nibbles of steak

Ass noodles

This place just really sucks like it always sounds really good but then you come and you instantly regret it

Ass hoodies

alright"
__label__5	Super cute place !!! Sand dabs were ok but the steak Cobb was wonderful ! Tons of veggies And bread too! Beautiful patio seating !!! Friendly staff!! Must stop by!!
__label__1	Walked in at 1 for lunch.  20% full.  Told flippantly to wait 20 mins.  They were glad to see us go so they don't have to work.
__label__5	"I love this location. The staff is always friendly, especially Amy who works right before I head in for night shift. They always make the drinks correctly, and they really seem to enjoy making a customer's day. I went in to claim one of my rewards, and I had them surprise me. Not at all disappointed with my decision to do so! 

I've never had any issue, and they are also great at getting through the long lines pretty quickly."
__label__2	"Sales price and trade in value acceptable for Reno area. After sale service non-existent. Promises to follow up missing emergency keys not kept. Calls not returned. Disappointed MB had sunk to the level of a ""buy-here-pay-here"" dealership."
__label__2	2 stars just for the Turkey and Brie sandwich. It was soggy, with maybe 2 thin slices Turkey, a teaspoon of Brie on each half of the sandwich and maybe 4 very thin slices of apple. That was it. No flavor really. Finishing it out with an overcooked chocolate chip cookie. Not a great meal.
__label__5	Didn't expect it but, K-POT Korean BBQ & Hot Pot was really outstanding. Cool vibe. Every item that we ordered was extra fresh and yummy. The people are super kind and it really is so good to just be there. Can't wait to visit K-POT Korean BBQ & Hot Pot again!
__label__2	Stopped in with family for brunch.  I love the ambiance of this place.  Just wish the food was better.  I had the chorizo skillet it was ok, lacked flavor.  Everyone else had street tacos that they couldn't eat due to the corn shells totally falling apart.  Chips were ok.  Service was good, server was very attentive.  We may give them one more try.
__label__5	Outstanding everything my home away from home. Thanks to all staff and management. Overall I had a wonderful experience here at TownePlace Suites they put guests first in every way Miss Betty Earl Kathy Jess Cyro it's a credit to a very successful management team
__label__5	What a quaint spot right on the boardwalk. Grouper sandwich is huge and yummy. Servers are awesome. Cold beer.
__label__5	I been getting food from here for years because it's close to my house. My neighbor worked there at the front desk briefly and mentioned how clean they were in the kitchen. I love the pizza here, 10/10. I'm very picky with pizza places bc there's so many around but I definitely suggest this restaurant for all comfort food needs! Definitely worth every penny!
__label__5	Nice restaurant for sure. I love their smoothed fries which is amazing and also love love their ribs, tri-tip and pulled pork. I was there for lunch so no duck in the lunch menu. What a pity! The staff's name is James and he offered a great service to us.
__label__4	Pretty decent place to be on the windy and cold day in Clearwater. The restaurant seems pretty low key, friendly wait staff, although ours was slightly pushy to our liking. We ordered fresh oysters and they are quite fresh and cleanly shucked, pretty basic condiments and lemon wedges seem a bit old lol. Their lobster roll was pretty tasty and lots of meat-- all in all a generic typical place with 4 stars for fresh oysters but ok food compared to other places
__label__5	Just moved here from Massachusetts! I have got to say, out of all really good Latin American Restaurants I've been, this is absolutely the best one I've ever encountered. This family owned buisness has a genuine staff and very kind people who took care of me and my Co worker to their best generosity. Their pupusas and quesadulla's were so delicious! Must try. I can definitely say I recommend anyone to come here if you're looking to enjoy affordable and delicious food.
__label__5	Great atmosphere, views, food & drinks!  Felix our server took great care of us & was very attentive.  We had the red snapper ceviche, chips & salsa with guacamole and two margaritas.  Yes, please!
__label__4	Sandwiches are excellent and always consistent.  I'll choose this place any day when we want them.  Regular Pizza on the other hand is blah.  Not traditional style NY like everyone else.  Seems to be a great family but man they'll do anything to get some media coverage!
__label__5	We came here to see a Christmas Carol and I have to say it was amazing.  It was our first time here and something every year we say we are going to do.  We finally snatched up the Yelp deal on ticket prices. I would have paid full price to see this.  Not a bad seat i. The house.  Beautiful theatre, amazing performance.  I love the minimal feel and you honestly find yourself getting lost in the production.   My kids adored it.  This is going to be our new family holiday tradition.
__label__5	I can't be happier that this place exists! Last week, I met up with a couple of friends here, got some popcorn, tried a new Dragoon seasonal, caught the end of Little Shop of Horrors and the beginning of Hairspray, and then put together a mixed six pack to take to a party. And the week before that, I got to taste some beers paired with girl scout cookies while watching True Grit. The beer selection is excellent, with new things added all the time.
__label__1	Did not have my reservation despite having a confirmation number, didn't really get to use preferred service, I go inside, they tell me to go outside
__label__2	"Went back recently and found subpar food quality. Lukewarm pasta dishes as well as coffee during a busy night. Best to go on a week night when the kitchen isn't swamped. Desert cakes probably supermarket quality, nothing exciting and bland. Maybe the owner is spread a little too thin between here and his other locations? 
Francisco's is loosing its luster!"
__label__1	"Whatever you do, don't waste you're money on the $10 flat braided lightening cables. Completely worthless garbage, iPhones won't recognize them. 

As usual, Staples selling garbage to rip people off."
__label__1	The worst dining experience in New Orleans. Period. Sucks! It took 90 minutes to get our meal from seating. It's pretentious. Do not eat here!
__label__4	I did the Pick Two. Portion sizes were a bit small for me, but food was great tasting, had quality ingredients, and restaurant had friendly service.
__label__5	"I've been using HRT for over 5 years.  I just turned 55 and feel like I'm 35.  I started HRT with Cenegenics in Atlanta, then a wellness clinic in Delray Beach. I've moved a few times in recent years but I've now found a permanent home in St. Pete and also a home at St Pete Health and Wellness. These folks know their stuff and Jayla who runs the office is absolutely precious and kind.  Nice people is why I decided to live in St Pete and this office exemplifies ""niceness""!"
__label__5	Best sushi in Brandon! Menu is very large and prices are very reasonable. Sushi is always fresh and specials are creative. They also have a hibachi and Thai options.
__label__4	It's my favorite Mexican place in Hamilton county. Such good food. Nice staff. They made carry out easy and was ready to go.
__label__4	"Came in with a small group after a dreary morning bike ride.  And you know we hit up that $5 slice and a pint deal.  I had a couple slices of meat lovers and I believe a Canebreak and a Bell's Two-Hearted Ale. 
The bartender was super friendly and chatty, and catered to our every whim.  The pizza was greasy as you'd expect, and quite delicious.  Typical NY style bar pizza. Cool little place."
__label__5	This is a new favorite with a twist of any diet you can imagine, CALI can suffice. I was so excited to try this place knowing it was on the healthy side and need i say I could NOT be more impressed. Their entrees, tue atmosphere, & vibe will have me coming back. The decor was not what I expected because it was better, it was chill and they had live music!! Can't wait to come back!!
__label__4	Not to bad sandwich was good and so was the sweet potato fries. The location is somewhat hard to find parking but other than that no problems.
__label__5	Great experience if your looking for the different!  Attention to detail, beautiful plate presentations, and taste all top rate. Can't believe they've been around since 2013 and we just tried it.
__label__2	We finally made it to Smashburger and thankful that it was on a two for one coupon. We had the avocado burger and after taxes this itty bitty morsel came in approaching two digits.  I think the burger was ok, but definitely not at that price point.
__label__5	Beth is one of the best hairdresser I've ever met - she is very knowledgeable she takes the time to listen and makes sure you are totally satisfy with the results - I will definitely recommended her.
__label__2	"Once this was a real Jewish deli. Now it's mostly a joke - a stale Jewish joke perhaps. 

Matzah ball soup tasted suspiciously like canned broth. Ruben was barely ok. My daughter's chili was awful. Cake was stale. 

Waitress was lovely, but quality control seems to have gone out with the Jew-fro. 

Sad!!"
__label__5	I love this place!  The chicken is moist and delicious!  I also love the sides!  The cilantro rice, the salad, and the spicy beans are all delicious with the chicken!  I also loved the fried plantains!  Amazing!
__label__1	"They preach being hands on during the birthing process. But we had our baby at the hospital and they were our mid wives and they were terrible they didn't help at all or give us any tips. The birthing class teacher barely knew anything besides what was on the syllabus and nothing more. A lot of our questions were answered with I don't know. 

I would suggest you keep looking we were very unhappy"
__label__4	Great chicken tacos! The tacos (minus a few special ones) are 99 cents on Tuesdays! The regular red salsa that they serve with the chips is VERY spicy but really good tasting. They also have a nice green salsa if you ask for it. There may be a little bit of a wait after ordering, but it never gets so long that I feel upset about it. Overall, the food is good, the service is friendly and the wait is manageable.
__label__5	Sheree Ackerman made an adorable Minion birthday cake for my daughter's 4th birthday.  My daughter is dairy free and Sheree was up to the challenge to create a moist and delicious cake and with the perfect design. There wasn't a crumb left! You have to give Goldie's Goodies a try.
__label__5	Breakfast is delicious. Try a hash with hollandaise. Or, if you please, replace the ham in the Benedict with smoked salmon. Service is great for a counter restaurant.
__label__5	"Mark W. has been our technician for several years.  He is always on time and works quickly.  I especially appreciate how he explains the problems or potential problems with clarity.  We never feel pressured to purchase or make changes, but feel informed instead.  

Thank you for the great customer service."
__label__1	This restaurant was just in the news for poor health practices. This has been a concern of mine for years! Apparently the place was filled with cockroaches----gross! My last experience here was one that I will never forget. The chef sprayed water in the faces of me and my friend as a part of the cooking entertainment. After we informed the manager she brushed us both off and told us to get over it. I hope the health department shuts it down!
__label__5	"Been wanting to try this  place for a while and we were out and about so we decided to ride over. Just chicken and a few sides. 

Chicken was really cooked well. Nice and juicy."
__label__5	Didn't know what to expect when going because of its location. However, the place is great. Service was great and so was the food! The price is a deal and the portions are generous. I got the buffalo chicken sandwich and was not disappointed. I'll definitely be back to try something else!
__label__1	There's no point in putting a pick up time if you still have to wait over 30 mins more on top of your 'pick up' time. Horrible service. Called curbside pick up and employee said they're working on it. Called 30 mins after sitting in the car waiting and employee said they're still 'working on it.'
__label__4	"Cutest shop ever!!!  Love the flavor selection, def worth a trip!  3 scoops will set ya back $6.  We tried:
Reisling pear sorbet-my fav
Goat cheese and berry (?)-nice
Milkiest chocolate-waaaay to grainy for me
Salted caramel-pretty yummie
Brambleberry-my other fave
Peach cobbler-ish one-meh"
__label__2	Not a bad place. Except for the giant active landfill across the street. If you are into huffing methane gas this is your place.
__label__5	Love living here.  Friendly staff and neighbors.  Luxurious amenities fun for a day off work!
__label__5	What a great find! Fuji was just what we needed for our sushi fix. Great food, great atmosphere and great service! We will for sure be back!
__label__5	"We ordered takeout from Umai for the first time.   Everything was really good, EXCEPT, a separate charge, after I paid $80+ for the order...   $3.41 for Mayo, soy and Wasabi extra???   Tacky!   Please don't nickel and dime me!

Manager called us regarding the $3.41 and cleared it up!   We are fans for life.   The quality and quantity was AWESOME!!!   See you guys again, VERY SOON!!!"
__label__5	"We called Warren (the owner of Boss Plumbing) to help us with multiple projects and problems we had and he and his crew came out immediately every time and did not leave until the job was done. He is a very knowledgeable, experienced, and has a vast network. I can only highly recommend him and his company for any plumbing job you may have.

Among the things he helped us with:
1) installing new outdoor faucet 
2) cleaning backed up sewer pipe 
3) repining sewer line and installing a new cleanout 
4) repairing sewer mainline"
__label__5	I go for lunch and enjoy cheesesteak or chicken cheesesteak. Service is great always friendly. Guys behind counter are friendly quick to chat , always a good experience.
__label__5	Great atmosphere! Great prices on beer compared to other bottle shops. Their prices all around are very competitive. The same brands of cheese you might find at Acme are at least a dollar or two cheaper, but they have other high-end, local, small business products, also very fairly priced for the opportunity to support small businesses. It's family owned and the cashiers are helpful and friendly.
__label__5	Stunning vistas, lush grounds, and exquisite architecture. Wonderful for daydreaming.
__label__5	Simply fantastic service with knowledgeable employees. Adam was superb in taking time to make sure all of my needs were taking care. Will definitely be back to get more cruiser gear.
__label__5	I love Roy, the fresh food from the Farmers' Market, the service, the ambiance, the music, the art shows... and I always meet someone fun and interesting. When I have visitors from out of town, Roy is my first choice to bring them to. It feels truly Santa Barbaran.
__label__2	Hmmmm.....where to start... Food was good. Service was sub par. Michelle is not a top notch server. Had dirty utensils and dishes between courses- we had to cue her to clear our used dishes.  She pointed for a fellow diner to pass me my plate. Gave us our check before we were finished. Never refreshed our water/wine. When you pay their prices you expect better service....I have dined all around the world and this was mediocre at best. Spend your money elsewhere.
__label__2	The crawfish smelled really amazing which is what drew us in. Seating was quick and easy given their many tables and big space. All of their balcony outdoor seats were taken, but it was fine inside. However, service was really slow and the freshness of the food was not so great. We had to throw away some of the crawfish which weren't good. The charbroiled oysters were also disappointing after having ACME and Felix's. We probably won't be back.
__label__3	Very sweet young lady that helped us however my snowball was pretty chunky and watery. I was going to post them on our IG page @the_marketing_chicks as a place we visited but I'll be reaching out to them via email to offer a few tips and suggestions instead. Man I wanted a snow ball so bad too #sad
__label__5	"One of my favorite restaurants in AZ. Locally owned, and you can feel that the owners really do care about their customers! The restaurant has nice home style feel, and the mac - AMAZING! 

The Hawaiian BBQ mac and High Voltage are must tries, especially when you get them in a wrap. 

Highly recommended, perfect to bring your kids to!"
__label__5	Was so excited to visit Hattie B's.  Oh the fried chicken... It did not disappoint.  Small white is plenty with the sides.  The chicken was so moist and tasty.  Ordered it mild;  should have gone medium; next time getting hot sauce on the side.  The greens and slaw were exceptional.   And the cherry cobbler was insane.  We need fried chicken like this in Denver !
__label__5	I had a great experience at Gypsy Saloon for lunch this week. They have great outdoor seating, a very quaint little area that's perfect for enjoying a beautiful day. The inside is a little dark though. Food was great, I ordered a Cajun chicken wrap which came with fries. Everything was very fresh and tasty. Would definitely come back for lunch or dinner!
__label__4	"First time for my roommate and I both here. It has the ""Old City remodeled"" feel to it, but the menu is Southern, which makes for a fun combination. We had bbq chicken sliders, wings & fries. All of which we were very happy with. To fit the season we had spiced cider to drink and that was aaaaamazing!!! I could see myself coming back here again especially with friends who are visiting from out of town so we can show them a place with Old City charm."
__label__4	"Good menu options
Seems like chat is their specialty 
Cut mirchi was awesome
Pizza was disappointing though!
Place was fine a little maintenance was needed, a single employee was supposed to be taking orders at counter and also bring food to the tables(mostly delayed)"
__label__4	"Went there yesterday for lunch.  They don't open until 12 noon - seriously...on the dot.  
Food was good.  Lots of variety for burgers and they are fairly large.  Had a lot of flavor but actually needed something like mayo or mustard, otherwise just a little dry.  I ordered mine medium rare and it came out perfect.  Saw a salad that someone ordered at another table.  It looked amazing.  You won't leave this place starving.  Wait staff was exceptional.  Will be returning."
__label__1	My nails looked great after I had them done, but after just a week they started breaking off. I've done acrylic nails off/on for years and I've never had them break off like this!
__label__5	Stopped in yesterday for the first time. It was a refreshing experience. They actually care about their customers. Bought a pair of shoes and will surely be returning for more as the season unfolds. Thanks.
__label__5	Having taken many Free Walking Tours in various cities, John's tour is one of the best. His research is very throughout. His energy, passion and humor make the tour very enjoyable. We learnt so much interesting history of Santa Barbara. Highly recommended!
__label__5	"Our favorite hotel so far, it's a little hidden gem only with 23 rooms. Everything was prefect and the Wi-Fi was the fastest I've ever seen at a hotel. 

Location is prefect to the main State Street, not to close and not too far. The beach was a little bike away but they rent bikes at the hotel too.

Brian at the concierge desk was ridiculously good with dining suggestions and going above and beyond to help."
__label__1	The receptionist is SO RUDE and unwelcoming. She not only treated me like I was an idiot for needing medical attention, she also treated an elderly lady who came in after me like she was an idiot because she didn't know that this location wasn't in her insurance's network. I will not go back.
__label__4	Im traveling for work and needed to find a place to wash and dry some clothes. This place is fairly priced, clean and the attendant was pleasant and friendly.
__label__1	"They send multiple emails with links to provide missing information, but then there's nothing on the site to identify what they're looking for or the ability to enter it.

I've had 4 background checks in the past 6 months and this is the only one that wanted to mail in a paper form and fingerprints to my state records agency and then wait 45 days for a response rather that using online (Docusign) form validation and submitting a check that way.  I'm about to pull out of accepting a $200K/year job offer because my prospective employer uses these clowns."
__label__5	Our go to spot for viet-Cajun seafood! We usually get it seasoned with the EZ Blend, which is an absolute flavor bomb! The variety of side choices are amazing as well. Highly recommend taking a bag home and go to town on seafood with friends!
__label__5	Where do I start? The vibe, the organization, the drinks, the nitro, the staff...let's start with the vibe, it's invigorating and invites you, welcomes you to find a spot and get comfortable! Everything is neat and clean and organized as if the place was just opened (but it wasn't). The nitro brew (esp. the Ethiopian one) is absolutely mind boggling. But if you go, ask for Kelsey (sorry if I spelled it wrong) as she is the absolute best barista!
__label__5	The food is amazing! Me and my husband are addicted to the food here. We could eat it everyday. We always try to bring some home so we can enjoy it another day. When we finish it we are so sad that their is none left. If you haven't eaten here, you don't know what you're missing!
__label__2	Definitely not the best Chinese take out.  I prefer not to go in to every detail as I could be here for quite some time but I will say fried rice was nothing like any other I've had and I don't mean that in a good way.   As for the veggies, well let's just say, if I wasn't in the presence of others, some would of been spit out.  On the plus side,  the white rice was good, the shrimp although not the freshest didn't get me sick and the gentleman at the counter was very friendly :)
__label__4	We ordered two sushi rolls and had the hibachi grill all was good the chef was friendly and fun our favorite roll of the two was the indy 500 roll
__label__3	Food was tasty but the portions were very small. My wrap and fries left me hungry. Great iced tea and I love the flavored ketchup options.
__label__5	I have loved every option to come out of this joint. I'm a pescatarian, diet favors seafood, and the quality is amazing. They deliver via Uber eats and the quality is typically amazing. Fries are questionable but that's anywhere . My favorites include the Po boy and She crab soup .
__label__1	This place has went down hill! It's crazy how fast this place went down. This was for my son birthday and it's most likely his last birthday here.
__label__5	"Their happy hour deal is fabulous! Two dollars for one taco with so much meat on it. The pollo Verde is my favorite. The Verde sauce is delicious. My fiancé gets the barbacoa which he loves. They have really good hot sauce too! 
I called in my order and it was ready and waiting for me when I got there. The employees were friendly and it was a good experience!"
__label__5	Love this place!!! Most amazing yogurt ice cream ever!  nice service and easy parking!
__label__4	One of the best burgers in town! They have an excellent selection and perfect outside seating in the summertime. I love the charco burger, fried green beans and  crunch cone.
__label__5	Variety of great massage therapists each who have a unique style and one of the best straight forward chiropractors around! Best I've been to! Oh and their office is pretty relaxing too
__label__5	"Felt very Covid safe overall except our waitress needed a new mask. She had to keep adjusting lt
Good distancing 
Food great as expected.  
It's always high on our list as well as a preferred restaurant to take guests!"
__label__4	WE were across the street at a local hotel and we stopped in because it was just so convenient. The waiter came by and was very helpful.  The place was a local hangout that does not serve any food so they are dog friendly.  We love that.  They also help you order food elsewhere and have it delivered if you want.  We actually got great ideas on places to eat from other patrons of the bar.  Good drink and good people!
__label__5	The best place is St Louis for dessert. We always have to stop there for a cupcake or to take some home whenever we are close by.
__label__5	Good burgers. A tad small, but it's basically a bar ha.
__label__5	The Russell was absolutely fabulous! Such a gorgeous historic building- the stained glass windows are stunning and all of the furniture/decor was great! We stayed in the penthouse room and the vibes were immaculate. Good location, in walking distance to anything you might need.  Wish I could've spent more time here-- but that just means I'll be back soon!  #RussellNashville #buzzybooth
__label__5	Mr. Nolfi and his team are the go to professionals. They just completed two new rubber roofs on my house with several feet of drainage pipes. Then I needed to have the window dormers done. The work was exceptional and the guys on the team were polite. They cleaned up any debris. Mr. Nolfi was busy but always called me back and went out of his way to schedule me in despite several days of bad weather. I will be calling them again and highly recommend Rob Nolfi Roofing!
__label__5	I recently tried this spot after a regular recommended. Pizza came out quick and hot! Beautiful views from the patio and plenty  of craft beer to choose from. The servers are all hilarious and kind!
__label__4	The best (and unfortunately only persian/iranian) restaurant in Tucson. Sometimes slightly over seasoned (depending on who cooked) though not so much so that it would  harm the dish or would prevent someone from enjoying the dish. We love koobideh, joojeh, barg and lamb kebabs (they offer combinations), sabzis, salads, and rice. Their lebanese food is also good.
__label__5	My Nuro ophthalmologist from Philadelphia suggested that I go to Fortuna in New Jersey to have my glasses made, since the prescription involved corrective lenses with prism's. I have never once had a problem with my glasses, And have received the most outstanding service for many years! This is the only place I would go anymore. Msgr. Marucci
__label__4	Enjoyed the pizza app. It was basically a personal pizza lol. I ordered the Reuben wrap. It was really yummy with the egg and potato. I split it with my friend. She dipped hers in thousand island dressing and I did the buffalo. Both sauces tasted good. I wasn't super crazy about the French fries. Overall, pretty good.
__label__5	This is a must stop dessert shop! Eat there or take it to go and enjoy at home or in your hotel later! They have the cutest designed desserts I've ever seen and even have chocolates and macaroons! I got a box of 15 which consisted of flavors like watermelon, Peace's and cream, white chocolate strawberry, and pistachio!
__label__4	A very casual British style pub in a strip mall in South Pasadena.  Serving all the usual lovely British grub.  I always get the fish and chips and I'm never disappointed.
__label__5	I was recommended to Brazilian Beekini by a friend in class and have been a client of Karla's for the past 6 months. Absolutely the best wax salon in Tampa!
__label__5	This hotel is great. Super dog friendly and a great environment with good energy. Best of all is the restaurant. Whoever is the chef is amazing. Their menu is small but every single thing I've had has been fantastic. Would 1000 percent stay here again.
__label__5	One of the best breakfast places in St. Louis. For the quality of the food the prices are reasonable and I had the best cinnamon roll I've ever had.
__label__5	Great relaxing atmosphere, beautiful service. Nancy is really welcoming and nice. Great food knowledge. Service up to par. Bartenders-special thanks to delicious and well composed drinks.
__label__1	Unfortunately, getting 1 star for terrible service. The lady serving me had an attitude right from the beginning and clearly did not care or want to be working that day. I was planning on ordering several items for my family to try. I deliberately paused after each one so that the worker could get each dessert. But in a very exasperated tone, she yelled at me to hurry up and just say what I wanted, even though I was the only one in line. Low and behold, when I opened my bag, items were missing, items that I didn't order were in there, and everything was just thrown in.
__label__3	Had a shattered screen, 30min they fixed it. I went back 5min later as I was walking to my car I noticed there was some color distorting. I pointed it out, they asked no questions and immediately re-replaced the screen as I waited another 30min. My thoughts they provide good, honest work.
__label__5	Overall experience is a 5 out of 5 - hotel is 4, location is 6, Cynthia at the front desk is 10. We went to New Orleans for a birthday, and had 3 rooms next to each other, overlooking the pool. We could walk 3 blocks to Café Du Monde; 4-5 blocks to Royal or Bourbon St.; 4 blocks or so to Harrah's Casino; and we had no problem at all with noise. I will go back the next time.
__label__2	Overworked, stressed-out staff set the tempo for the experience. But the kicker was the bartender's insistence that a Classic Hurricane was a martini.
__label__5	"a BIG SHOUT OUT - to our Bartender Joe...... 
What a great dinner out!!!   My 23 year old son is Autistic and Joe treated him like any other patron !!!!  excellent job ......   we will be back
ps. food was good too :)"
__label__2	Pricey & unorganized. The gentleman working at the counter was focused on his TV & took several minutes to acknowledge me when I arrived to pick up my shoes. My shoes look nice but it was $90 to have a two heels repaired  & the soles of a pair of TB flats to be replaced. My shoes were not ready when he said they'd be ready.
__label__5	Great food for a good price with excellent customer service provided by Scarlet! Location was very clean, and we were impressed with the selection of both Pepsi and Coke products.
__label__2	Well looks like of changes has found a way to increase profits. That's done by decreasing portions but maintaining the high price.  If you plan on dining in, be ready for the loud music that many establishments incorrectly think makes their places hip, fresh and what most people want.  I'll grab a take out now and again, but won't be here often.  Too much $$$ and too much noise.  Oh, the staff is still nice.
__label__3	Stopped in for the new Minute Maid slushee. Of course on one of the hottest days the ice cream machine wasn't working and the shake side of the McCafe was not either. The employees stood around looking for a minute before making the drinks, they were also made at different times with a five minute interval in between. They were nice people but slow service. Probably won't return
__label__4	When in Metairie! This is a great place to get a quick bowl of pho.  I love that there are different sizes of bowl options to order from.  I got the pho dac biet and no complains here, the broth was great and it had plenty of meat.  Service was quick and friendly, will definitely be back!
__label__5	"Had breakfast here and it was perfect.  I remember ordering the Oysters Benedict and it was out of this world.  Our waiter was beyond polite and the whole atmosphere was worth the price.  Nobody left hungry or unsatisfied, and the Blood Marys were excellent.

I will definitely be back again and I recommend you try this place, but make sure and make reservations because it gets packed in the morning."
__label__5	"Loved it. PERIOD! The food is amazing, and so are the folks who work there. I found out about Heard Dat just by looking on yelp, and was more than thrilled with the outcome! This place is locally owned, and I would HIGHLY recommend to anyone going to New Orleans. 

Definitely would recommend the Surf and Turf, as well as the Dat Tea!

Thank you so much for the experience, and I'll be back whenever I'm back in the city!"
__label__4	"I got my first tattoo when I was 18 here and a few others. The artists are amazing. But, the piercer was supposed to give me a VCH and I ended up getting a Christina instead. I went to another shop to get it fixed but just strange from someone who said he's been doing this for 20 years. But overall,
clean, friendly shop."
__label__5	There is no other place I would take my dog! The staff is amazing and have been trained on how to be pack leaders. They never ever leave the dogs alone and love on them all day long. The dogs are treated with respect and love. They understand how dog behavior works and make sure your dog is healthy and happy while under their care. My dog always comes home better behaved and happier than before. I don't trust anyone else and drive an hour just to take him here. I recommend this place to anyone who really loves their dog!
__label__1	Went because I was with a group who wanted to eat here. I wasn't impressed. The place was dirty, menus were sticky, and it is a terrible choice for vegetarians. Literally, most of their 'vegetarian menu' is condiments! I had a side of potato salad to be able to eat something with my group, but it is essentially cold mashed potatoes.
__label__5	This is the best pad thai I have ever eaten. We came here from out of town and would eat here every day if we could. Service was amazing as well and the prices and specials are reasonable.
__label__1	This place is so inconsistent. The workers are polite; however, polite doesn't excuse the consistent mess. I'm there to receive what I ordered and on more than 2 occasions in one week, my orders have been wrong and/or not good. You try to work with a new business, but when you have to babysit a cook over your order repeatedly, it becomes exhausting. With the former owners, this was never the case. Even though I plan to never patronize them again, I hope they improve their services. How are you repeatedly messing up orders in an empty establishment??
__label__4	"Recently discovered this ""hidden"" comedy club at Petrini's, and have now gone three times. Good stuff, and very welcoming waitstaff, and comedians. Great way to spend a Thursday night."
__label__3	I bought the Groupon coupon online for a peel and microdermabrasion session. I've bought coupons for microdermabrasion before and this one is just eh compared to the other ones I have had. I was told that this is a mini version and therefore they skip a lot of steps.
__label__5	Highly recommend!! I love this place! I tried it for the first time last weekend and was very pleased with my experience. All of the staff was very friendly and welcoming. The menu is huge so there is something for everyone to enjoy. I tried the prime rib melt with au jus and it was so good and flavorful. The restaurant was clean. I wish I would have tried this place sooner. Will definitely be returning in the future.
__label__1	This place was so special with their authentic food when they were at their old location. I don't know if the business changed owners or what. Last time I ate their, the food was stone cold, the staff was very impersonal and cold. I sent the food back, first time ever, and apparently it was microwaved. I had the same exact plate and food that was sent back. The last of the real Mexican restaurants  in Reno. Very few patrons as compared to 2 years ago.
__label__4	Great prices and service for the public. Wish I had more time to go weekly. It does take a few min to get your order filled and paid for because they really are set up for wholesale but it is worth wait if you can.
__label__4	Very fresh and Delicious. You can tell they put love into their pizza's and only use the freshest ingredients...... I love a good crispy pizza and they have an option to have it cooked crispy or extra crispy which I love!! Will definitely be a repeat costumer!! Local & family owned is the way to go!!
__label__5	Food was great, service was a little slow, but again the food was GREAT so it was so worth the wait. The staff was very friendly. I will definitely be back.
__label__2	"it was our first time there. The food took way too long to come. Also, I asked for wheat toast dry. When it came with tons of butter on it I  wanted it done again .. I  assumed she was the owner the waitress and she gave me attitude.
there is alot of better restaurants around and we will NOT be returning."
__label__1	This Panera location is awful. They're always out of key ingredients, the staff is rude. Chips were sold out for over a month. I've never had a great experience here.
__label__1	The mini golf at the Golf Farm is a joke. The course is very sparse and plain. It's dilapidated to the point of dysfunction. I honestly don't think the course has seen any maintenance since the 1980's or whenever it was first built. I hear that the chip and putt section is acceptable but the mini golf is by far the worst I've ever seen. A pretty huge rip-off at $11 for me and my wife. Two thumbs down.
__label__1	Please do yourselves a favor and find another doctor, his indifference and incompetence will ruin your life. My foot, which had a minor problem is now deformed and will soon be useless because of this person who does not deserve to be called a doctor, but a butcher.
__label__4	Fun place to visit. The food was very good, and service was great! I had the Hawaii Kahuna Burger with pineapple, Swiss cheese, lettuce , pickles, on sour dough. Very good. We went during the day, but this place looks like quite a show during the evening hours. It's located in Ybor City, which reminds me of the French Quarters in New Orleans. If you're in town near Tampa, this is a very cool place with wonderful staff to check out.
__label__5	The food was great!  I went with 2 other people and they loved it as well.  Our waiter let us know before we ordered that the portions were now smaller and the prices were reduced by 30% so you're able to enjoy a 4 course meal.  I'm ok with that because it's rare you have room for dessert. By the way, our waiter was amazing too.  I would highly recommend Forage.
__label__1	Horrible staff. Always feels like they are looking for a reason to say something rude
__label__5	First time there. Sean and his men took great care of me.  With that kind of service I'll surely be back.
__label__2	Wasn't too impressed. The place is nice and the lady who did my nails was very nice. But I'm rating what I went in for: gel nail manicure. I had gel on my nails when I got there (the removal process was very painful, they filed the gel off after soaking them for like 2 min). The tip of my ring finger was cut (like there's a slit there, similar to a deep paper cut) and a few of the nails are really lumpy. Quite a messy job, as I am still peeling gel polish from around my nails.
__label__1	The server here is extremely rude and it took about 30 min to even get our drinks, not to even mention our pizza. The waitress gave everyone in the entire restaurant attitude. When we first walked in, all of the tables were dirty and we had to clean them ourselves. Come here when this place gets tore down and becomes a better restaurant.
__label__5	Absolutely fantastic brunch! Wait staff superb, friendly and efficient. Food was out of this world especially crawfish and grits and fried oyster appetizer. Beignets must be experienced to be believed.
__label__5	"Don't pass this up.....very good crispy grouper and excellent Red Curry shrimp...
..generous portions reasonably priced.....drinks reasonable also....service is adequate.  Eat outside on a street patio or done inside.....We're  definitely going back."
__label__3	The oysters and truffles were really good but the entrees and salads were overly salted and too heavy in dressing. If you order sale get the dressing on the side and ask for light flavoring on anything you order. I was going to do two stars but am doing three because they brought us champagne to compensate for the overly salty meal. Good service but stick to appetizers and drinks.
__label__4	Wow. Though I don't usually eat burgers I was surprised. Veggie choice, healthier bun plus a 'careful' presentation. Why can't most of other American fast food chain serve the same level of expertise as this place?
__label__5	Awesome selection of food and drinks! Great service  and experience as well, especially from Jay our server. Great mix of professional and entertaining. Repeat customer for sure!
__label__5	I love this book store!  It is so well organized and the staff has great recommendations.  They had books for my son on the shelves there before Barnes&Noble.  They also order books for you.  I love the community feel.  Great addition to Wayne!
__label__3	"The food was DELICIOUS but the service was horrible. I ordered food online through Yelp and when my bf went to pick it up he was ignored, and forgotten. I understand how challenging staffing is these days and help is needed however, the staff that is working needs to do a better job with customer service. Doesn't cost a thing to say ""hello, may I help you?"""
__label__5	I love The Bricks. The Bird & Pig sandwich is a must try! As is their Liquid Heroine Latte! Service is friendly, food is always good and very tasty, drink specials are fantastic. The restaurant itself has a very laid back vibe which makes it perfect for any occasion. My favorite place in Ybor for lunch when I'm visiting Tampa.
__label__2	"I went here to buy a major label dog food. The price was about twice as high. So is everything twice as high as other places? Also, while looking for items it would be nice if the ""helpers"" were some what educated about the products.
I always look for coupons and am a member of the awards / frequent customer program. It doesn't seem as if the awards / frequent customer program takes the sting from the ""almost"" twice as high price you pay for major brands. When I see prices like this for major brands I always have to wonder about the other products."
__label__4	"I enjoyed a very good ""Stuffin"" sandwich here yesterday! This included turkey, cranberry and stuffing on whole wheat. You really cannot go wrong with that combo. I even checked in on Yelp and got my free drink! My only critique is that I expected a warm sandwich and it was actually cold. That threw me off a lot. I would have enjoyed it a lot more if it was warm and maybe served with a side of gravy for dipping!"
__label__1	Got wrong order - store blamed it on the driver.  Promised to call me back and did not.  No apology    - just stated I would get a refund but offered nothing for my trouble.
__label__5	Try the honey poppy seed dressing with mango, strawberries and  nuts. It is a tasty sweet summer salad made perfectly!
__label__5	I had a great experience!  Everyone took time to help me understand my treatment plan in order to achieve the results I wanted.  I would highly recommending going to Tucson cosmetics. I can't wait to go back for my follow up!
__label__1	Beware - they replaced my furnace and all looked good but when the inspectors came they found a transformer wired inside the furnace not mounted to anything with exposed terminals. When I called up to ask to have it fixed they insisted I pay a service call charge of $125. (Mind you this is after I spent over $7000 on heat and AC unit) I will never deal them again - all the good reviews are insider collusion
__label__1	Update: WTHR did a story on this place this morning. Don't believe everything you see in the media. The place is still a pit.
__label__3	Bring back old management! I would give the old Nippon tei 5/5 stars. They took away our favorite roll Fujiyama! Very upset. Don't mess with a good thing
__label__4	The stadium is beautiful. However, during the unpredictable fall/winter it would be nice to have a closed dome.  I like that it was a stress free check in. Everything is cashless so they provide you with stadium wifi.  The other thing is the stadium seats have great views from every angle.  I would suggest that they allow for a variety of food selection with one being WFPB/vegan.
__label__5	Absolutely a must if you love sushi and Asian cuisine. They know their sake and the sushi is always fresh. The service is top notch. If you go anywhere else, you are missing out. I love this place!
__label__5	"We took in a Pre game lunch at the tgi Fridays downtown location. Fast service. Friendly staff. Good food. 
Tower of beer special looks cool. Ask about it."
__label__3	I bought a gift certificate for my mom and her husband for this bistro and they loved it. They went to buy one for me in return and it is closed. Any idea when or where (or if) they will be opening their doors again?
__label__1	So disappointed. I've heard great things about this place but they failed to deliver. HORRIBLE customer service. The environment was dirty as were the staff. The food was ok. Never going back.
__label__3	Good selection of beers in cans (Bitburger; yes), and decent food. The fried bologna sandwich is unbelievable if you're the sort of person who will get down on a fried bologna sandwich, or if you're the sort of person who likes a hot dog and hasn't realized that bologna is basically sliced hot dog. GET IT. The wings are pretty off-brand though, and the mac & cheese has a weird sweetness to it. If there's live music count on it being terrible.
__label__5	I really enjoyed the chicken quesadilla. I am particular on how I like my pizza steak made and Gus's will make it just how I like it. Layered and grinded.
__label__5	Haven't been here since 2013 and I must say I have been missing out!! The server Mark was awesome!!!!  The food was excellent, and I definitely will be back soon.
__label__5	Great friendly service everything is neatly organized not a lot in the retro section of the store but still a great selection and I was able to find what I was looking for still a great store :)
__label__5	Delicious!! Get the fancy dessert that takes time to prepare. SO worth it!!
__label__5	I love Kelly!! She's so beautiful and talented!!!! Never leave disappointed. If I could put 10 stars I would!
__label__1	I did that.  Management called and tried to convince me that my horrible experience hadn't happened.  This place needs a serious overhaul.
__label__4	First review in order.  Our little gem is finally getting the popularity it deserves! Food is delicious and everything is so clean and appetizing.  Best Honduran place we've tried in the city and my husband is from Honduras, so that says a lot!! Very recommended!
__label__5	We love nutbelly! Great food and a lot of their produce is bought locally at the farmers market! Yummy pizza and pasta. And their soup of the day is always good.
__label__4	Had dinner here last night with the family and the food and service was great. I have not had German food like this since I was stationed in Germany and loved it. I suspect that I will become a regular at this restaurant.
__label__4	One of my favorite places in Reno for lunch. The lunch special is such a good deal, especially if you go in before 3pm. I love the red curry! Don't forget to order a Thai iced tea. Yum!
__label__4	"I love La Colombe. I love their cold brew, I love their hot coffee. I love their artisanal sandwiches. I don't love that they don't offer free WiFi. What kind of coffee roaster doesn't have free WiFi? 

La Colombe, if you're listening, get WiFi and I'll update my review to 10 stars. 

Also my office just got La Colombe machines for our kitchen, and they're amazing."
__label__1	"How is it possible that a ""luxury apartment"" that charges an astronomical amount not have stainless steel appliances?
Also, I think the for rent sign on the sidewalk cheapens the place."
__label__5	First time I entered this location and was very much impressed . The customer service staff were very helpful as i need few of the lawn and garden products. The checkout was very pleasant. I used to go to Ace in Oldsmar Fl on Tampa Road and never found customer service associates to be helpful and knowledgeable,
__label__5	One great haircut and amazing stylist leads to a lifetime customer. And that is what I am. Went for the first time today and got lucky enough to snag an opening with Savannah. This chick rocks!!  I told her exactly what I wanted and what I didn't want. And let me tell you she rocked it out!!!  Decently priced considering the attention to detail from the moment you hit the door until you walk out.
__label__5	Me and my wife are in the area visiting from Indiana and decided to drop in at Shell's for a bite to eat. Our waitress Jill was incredibly kind and the food was to die for! Definitely will be coming back for our next visit!
__label__1	I'd be able to comment on the food if they had served us anything but room-temp coffee in the HOUR we spent waiting. We finally left because we were starving and there was no sign of our food coming out.
__label__2	"Hello Devi !!!

The food is bad!!! The servers seemed to be very proud.... They were not helpful in evening taking away the used plates from the table. 

On the whole the food also doesnot taste good!!!"
__label__5	If you're looking for the best seafood in the Palm Harbar. Always fresh fish great menu fabulous wine and drinks
__label__4	"Decent pizza, delicious ""no name cake,"" and good company. The pizza was alright; I enjoyed it while I ate it but nothing to write home about in my book (I see the irony of writing that in a review). Added the garlic strips to my order and I was more confused by that than anything else. It was a cute idea but just a little confusing (pizza dough with garlic sprinkled on top and baked). 
If I'm in the area I might stop back in for a bite but I'm not sure if I'd go out of my way for it."
__label__2	"We went there on Saturday, 9/19 Had to wait about an hour to be seated and 2 hours to get our meal and there was only 3 of us. I order a lobster bisque, which tasted like velveeta cheese and had maybe one small peace of lobster in it and a shrimp avocado salad. My son had a jerk burger which was not spicy at all. And my husband had a very tasteless blackened grouper.

People that came in and ordered after us got served before we did. 

The waitress was friendly but we are not going back again."
__label__5	"Great food! Great service! Nice and quiet! If you go with a group and share the dishes, it will feel like a feast.

The food tastes authentic. They certainly don't skimp on the ingredients. Fatty, delicious lamb and raw onions may not be for everyone, but they certainly take me somewhere else."
__label__5	Ordered a vegetable omelet with grilled vegetables on the side without all the butter & oil and wow did they hit it out of the park.  Most places are very stingy with the veggies esp for breakfast and only give tiny chopped up stuff that you need a spoon to eat.  They gave me the works.  I loved and will keep coming back regularly if they keep that up.
__label__4	This is a gem to find. The atmosphere is very relaxing and all the staff are attentive to your requests and needs. The products are natural and the services are more expensive than other places but they do great work. No harsh chemicals are used so the environment also smells amazing. I would absolutely encourage you to pamper yourself with a mani, pedi, or massage from Greentoes.
__label__5	"Such a great new addition to downtown Dunedin!
We had super refreshing fresh squeezed drinks and the most amazing delicious panini. Everything was very fresh and high quality. Stop by and enjoy deliciousness right on the Pinellas trail in the red box car. 
Staff was super friendly and accommodating:)"
__label__1	Nice inventory but rude, offensive mgr. Compared to other local nurseries with stellar staff, this establishment is sorely lacking in customer relation skills.
__label__4	"Food and service is great. However I always feel very heavy after eating here. If your looking for complex sauces then this is the place. If you want simple food, this is not the place. Great cocktail and beer list! 

I would recommend this place to anyone however I will give the caveat."
__label__5	Maybe the perfect breakfast in the area : friendly staff , good coffee , solid menu selection and great food !!! I enjoyed the Bacodo Benedict almost every morning this week !! The mermaid French toast was yummy but only tried it once. If your looking for the perfect spot to grab breakfast after a beach stroll Sandys is your spot.
__label__4	"I finally got to hear what the hype was all about on my first trip to Philly last week.  I've had cheese steaks before, but not Philly-style!

This place is authentic!  It was sooo good!

Service is fast, but that means you better know what you want to order too.  Parking is a bit on the crazy side since the place is so popular."
__label__4	16 inch pizza, 20 wings and a house salad for $30? SOLD!  This is our first family vacation to St. Pete.  We heard this pizza place was pretty good so we decided to make sure to carry out one night!  Great place, great food and great prices!  This STL, thin crust pizza girl gives this NY style pie a big thumbs up!  Please give these guys your business! You will not regret your dollar!
__label__4	I think for the value this is your basic really decent pho. It's fast and reasonable. Usually go with the basic Pho Tai and add some hot chili paste, rip up the Thai basil and add the bean sprouts. I like this location because its always busy so everything is very fresh. It's adjacent to the TNT grocery store. Awesome for a quick bit of nourishment, or take it home after shopping for a great Sunday night meal.
__label__1	I wanted to try the new chicken sandwich that everyone is talking about.  I opened the sandwich to find that it's just some chicken strips that they've put on a Hawaiian roll.  If I wanted chicken strips I would have ordered them.  Now I know.  I'll stick to chick-filet
__label__5	Everyone wearing masks, no indoor dining, hand sanitizer provided...food as always delicious AND NOT FISHY, my fav is Oro Valley roll and Dragon roll pictured, this was my birthday meal today
__label__4	"Recently came here with a friend and was reminded what a great place this is. Their beer menu is like the encyclopedia brittanica of all things hops-related, but I think the waitstaff does a great job at answering questions and articulating nuances when giving descriptions. 

All of their mussels are delicious - my favorite right now is their Ghent: Saison Dupont, fumé, parsley, carmelized leeks, bacon, bleu cheese & garlic. Awesome. And their bourbon mayo aioli dipping sauce for fries is seriously addictive. 

Will definitely be coming back here again."
__label__1	The pharmacy staff is completely incompetent to insurance coverage. They provided zero guidance that a prescription was available  over the counter and we got stuck with a $64 bill for something that's normally $20. I'd never trust them with my business until a change in pharmacy staff. Too many other options in the area for such poor service.
__label__1	I have been coming here for years and tonight, I wanted a quick drink. The bartender working tonight, 11/3 with the buzzed head ignored me and tried to help someone else and looked at me like I was his bitch and didn't say anything and just shrugged his shoulders when I wanted to ask for a drink. I walked off. Can't figure out if it's because I was a guy wearing eyeliner or just because he wanted to be rude to me specifically.
__label__1	Wow , I was hoping that just because this was in a gas station, it wouldn't be a gas station sandwich. I WAS WRONG. Disappointed.
__label__3	"I went to this location for the first time,  with a coupon for a free ham sandwich for joining their email list.

The service was quick and cheerful. Even though I was only there for free food,  I was treated warmly and with a big smile. 

The sandwich,  however,  left much to be desired. The croissant was dry, and there was literally a few drops of mayo on it. There wasn't even a full lettuce leaf. I'm not sure if they skimped because it was a freebie,  but I was very disappointed."
__label__5	"Its good, gross bathroom, plastic chairs, duct tape on wall, little parking, and yes, I'll be back, its that good. 

Number 16 and 17 are good and cheesy. One had tons of peppers, but not the hot parts. Good! 

I'm from Seattle, so I don't eat a lot of good Mexican food. But there is a lot of good food there. 

Tacos here are top notch, cheese melted just right, not greasy"
__label__1	If you look at the photo, you will see film was not installed correctly. The person in the shop told me because the rear window was not installed correctly from BMW so the film has to be installed like that. What a joke! They said that's the best they can do! Do yourself a favor to stay away from this place.
__label__5	This restaurant gets my all time favorite rating in Reno. I loved every dish. My boyfriend who believes I'm the greatest chef, compared the flavor to my food. We had the best tapas. The best service.  The best location. I have since brought friends and recommended This place time and again.
__label__3	Pretty good marinated beef and shrimp. Sides were all cold and not that great. Having been to Korea and eaten in many barbecue restaurants I would rate this a 3 for the US market it's in. Also no killer Korean desserts at all are offered.
__label__5	Jamie is AMAZING. I was so comfortable and relieved that I fell into a meditative state during my hour long massage. Couldn't recommend her more. Can't wait to go back!
__label__5	Epice continues to be one of my favorite restaurants. Great staff (friendly and attentive), outstanding food (can't say enough but the way spice is used amazes me), and beautiful atmosphere.
__label__5	I just find them very sweet and professional. They are close to the Farmers Market so over the years I have been walking in...very friendly and nice:)
__label__2	I waited for nearly half an hour to been seen despite being on time for my appointment which is never a good first impression. It was the shortest facial threading I've ever had and the most expensive. There was ZERO aftercare which surprised me. I also told her she missed quite a few patches of hair- she said they were ingrowns. When I got home I realized they were not ingrowns at all. I will go back to my cheaper salon that does a better job removing hair, respecting my time and actually has aftercare.
__label__5	Wonderful service and staff highly responsive to customer opinion!  Ordered mussels platter and such a delicious dish with a lot of complex flavors.  Although the outside looks unassuming, the inside atmosphere is very comfortable and quaint.  Hidden gem in the Fairmount area. Highly recommend!
__label__5	"Hubby and I love stopping here when driving thru town. Leave the SB traffic behind, and don't forget the hassel of parking either, because in beautiful secluded Montecito your not gonna get that.  But the food is just ""down"" or phenominally great here! We love the sweet and sour shrimp and wonton soup, oh and don't forget the amazing orange chicken.  This is a fav for locals, so you know the food IS great!  We love this place!  Can't wait to go back!!!!"
__label__4	I didn't really  like being stuck RIGHT NEXT to another couple, but the food was very good !
__label__1	"THEY DO NOT FOLLOW MASK GUIDELINES. 

you also have an openly anti-mask employee who seems aggressive.  This is unacceptable, immoral and in direct violation. 

DO NOT EAT HERE"
__label__5	"I love this place..

Soon when I hit philly from VA I get doordash to get my meal..

Love their wings.. hell everything..

Best oxtails..

We need more soulfood places vs Chinese stores..

Love this is a community restaurant.."
__label__5	I like this BK, staff is friendly & Stacy is great behind the counter. Got a frappe & sausage biscuit as usual. Place is clean, there were no paper towels in the men's restroom but they do have a Hand blower.
__label__2	I have loved dining here and decided to treat the family to a delivery and was under impressed. We got mac and cheese and pasta which were fine. However, the chicken in the chicken sandwiches were like cardboard. The chicken had the oddest texture. I was really disappointed. I am hoping to go back and get the real thing again though
__label__4	"Great burgers, great fried mac n' cheese, and a decent gumbo.

I was disappointed I missed out on trying their breakfast dishes - supposedly they make an awesome omelet.  If you are visiting NO and are looking for some simple wholesome food w/o being overcharged - this is the place to go!   

So this is a diner in the south."
__label__4	Had their food a few times. For a stand, makeshift eatery their food is pretty good. Excellent prices too ! Even offered coupons in The Flyer. Had to remove a star because a lot of the menu is in Spanish & the people waiting to take your order seems not to know English.
__label__5	This restaurant is great for all ages. They have the tank that holds 37 different types of ocean life and the tank holds 200,000 gallons of water. The food is a little pricey but worth it! Waiters and waitresses are very nice and can tell you very interesting facts about Nashville. Such as during the flood a few years back, the aquarium wasn't damaged! Recommended.
__label__5	My old review was for a different location. My apologies. Probably a nice establishment
__label__4	Giving this place 4 stars for their ribs which were some of the best I've had and for their grilled oysters with chili oil. So delicious!! And our waitress and staff were very nice and attentive! Definitely worth checking out!
__label__3	Great bar and have had a blast here but the band playing right now is not as awesome as they think they are. Refused to take a request for less than a 20.00 tip. Not that talented. Playing Sunday around 7:00.
__label__3	slightly expensive for the quality and portion of food, but it's alright overall, the chicken bowl is pretty good
__label__4	Yum! I needed a pizza fix after moving to Tucson and I was lucky enough to find this little hole in the wall. The pizza was delicious (pepperoni and smoked mozzarella) and I left with a happy tummy and a smile on my face.
__label__5	"Every time I come to Goose I struggle to get something other than a Batali sandwich. It's THAT good. 

Recently my friend Paul (who used to work there) turned me on to their signature sausage ""Dodge City,"" which is named for the neighborhood. It's worthy! It's a traditional rough-cut salami with a hint of fennel pollen for an oh-so-subtle finish.  Thanks loads, Paul. Now I have TWO must-haves!

Oh, and did I mention that they have Humboldt Fog? Yum!!"
__label__5	Very friendly, I planned on getting take out and the young man offered me a beverage and a seat. I will definitely return. Service is everything
__label__5	Best place to get pho on the westbank to me, I go there quite often and the servers are great! the bubble tea is also pretty dang good!
__label__2	The service is awful! We didn't wait long to be seated, but we waited an hour for our meal! The fried green tomato was delicious, but our waiter checked on us only once, after we finished eating to refill our drinks (mind you they had been empty for at least a half hour). They're also lacking in portions, we each only got like five fries as our side...where were the rest?
__label__4	If you were dragged to this mall as a 'baggage handler' and need a break, head towards the food court. But remember, most everything here will cause you to crash or fall into a diabetic coma. Hence Green Leaf's. Choose your greens (Spring mix, romaine, or spinach), 4 included toppings, and any of the variety of dressings (mixed in or on the side) to keep you healthy and support your physique as you carry all of your (or your significant other's) shopping bags around this enormous mall...
__label__3	I have one issue with Gilliganz.  Don't call in an order for pickup.  The last 3 times we did the staff ignored us.  Tonight 4 servers were standing around chatting while our food sat there getting cold.  It was not even under a heat lamp. We are paying customers too and expect to be served when we arrive. There is a lot of room for improvement when it comes to the service
__label__2	"Consistently Meh says Mikey 

Chili's itself is decent . But this location is brutalzz 

Seems no ownership and or management ever present 

Food quality is spotty and service can be very slow if they have More than 5 tables occupied.  If parking lot is remotely fullz don't stop for lunch if you needz to be in and outz in under an hour 

Too bad theyz can't get it together.  Judging by all the other bad reviewz for this location they don't seem to be interested in improving"
__label__3	"A cool and cozy spot.  Must have reservations!!! Without reservations your stuck sitting at the tiny bar or balancing a plate and glass in seating available near the stage. Best to arrive before 6 on a Friday night to enjoy the No Cover performances 

Menu is limited and small, tasted the gumbo and it was super spicy, it was too dark to really see the food.

Make reservations!!"
__label__5	I had the soup, it was very fresh and delicious. The apple roll/pie is awesome. This is one of the best restaurants in the area in my opinion. Very large portions.
__label__1	Allowed my INSANE roommate to take my cat there without my permission while I was out of town for a few days and then somehow rack up a bill of $3000 without previous vet records or checking to make sure the cat was actually hers. Overpriced, irresponsible vet practice that needs to check the identities of the crazy, obviously-unhinged people who walk through their doors. Will sue the roommate when I move back stateside but this practice was absolutely complicit in letting another person make medical decisions for my animal and then footing me with the bill!
__label__5	Thanks to a R A T my M A P wires were chewed through over the Christmas holiday weekend.   Found charle's auto on yelp.  So glad I did friendly, fair and honest.  So nice to find a mechanic you can trust.   Fran.  Clearwater
__label__5	"This place always makes my day and especially saves a stressful day! 

I've had quite a few cupcakes here: the strawberry lemonade, carrot cupcake, red velvet, and the coma which I can remember right now.  While all of them were delicious, the carrot cupcake was to die for, and the coma (chocolate cupcake with ganache) was sooo delicious and just melted in your mouth.  Definitely my favorite spot for dessert in the city!!!"
__label__5	"just stopped in today on my lunch break- service was super fast and the pizza was incredible! i got the bruschetta slice and a pepperoni slice. both were great, but the bruschetta really shined. 2 slices and a drink for 6 bucks? you can't beat that. this is my new favorite pizza place. 

the girl behind the counter was cute too and super nice. call me."
__label__4	Gorgeous scenery, but I give it 4 stars since it didn't top Mt. Lemmon - the views on Mt. Lemmon are just tough to beat!  Wish we could have done more than the one tram tour.  Another downside was that it seemed like we couldn't get a seat if we actually got off the tram - or if we could, we'd be stuck in the sun all the way down (not good for folks who aren't used to that much sun).
__label__4	Good tasty Hibachi steak cubes, sushi, and fried rice.  Friendly and prompt service.  Will come again.
__label__4	Great burgers, presentations are always nice. I personally prefer Burger 21 over Five Guys. I've tried every burger and rather enjoy them. My girl always gets the bean burger and loves it. Fries are always crispy and the chipotle sauce is nice to dip them in.
__label__5	"So many local artists and things to choose from here in a prime spot on Magazine Street! From paintings to photographs and random nick nacks, I got most of my Christmas shopping done here while supporting small business artists. One of my favorites, Cary Chung Lee, has a booth set up here. I will definitely be back whenever I need another gift in the future! 

After you're done shopping, head on over across the street to Ruby Slipper for brunch :)"
__label__3	Ok, let me start by saying I know we came late, but they shld still have plenty of donuts. Which they did not!! Very disappointing! Did not get to order what we normally do because they were all out! They still had an hour left before closing & they were already cleaning up. Chairs were stacked up & they were spraying down the conveyer belt. Also, they were throwing the garbage bags behind the counter even tho they had customers in the lobby. Very unprofessional!
__label__5	It's a great place to try Asian-American mixed style Chow Fun. I am a huge fan of all kinds of noodles. Absolutely love it!
__label__5	So so so so good. Even though we weren't allowed to have a happy hour burger hahah. It was a great experience!
__label__4	super solid tacos! i love the variations you can get. salsas were great and a really good drink selection. fun place to chill for the beach vibe. staff is fun and crowd is super laid back. if you want cheap tex mex cant beat this spot. will def go back if im in the area for a couple drinks.
__label__4	Hip City Veg was a delicious choice for lunch with my co-workers! The veggie burger was super yummy, and quite filling. I had a couple of sweet potato fries, and those were awesome, too! HCV is a welcome addition the UCity dining scene. The wait was fairly reasonable at lunchtime, and the food was great!
__label__2	I was very confused when I ordered a chirashi (always get them at every restaurant). It came it bits of pieces of fish like leftovers. Was not the freshest. I asked them if this was normal and they said yes but then I checked Yelp and it totally wasn't. Very disappointed because I love chirashi. Chicken ramen was okay, cod was pretty good, but otherwise would never return.
__label__1	I had Fast Glass come to my work to replace the windshield in my car, which was tremendously convenient (and at no extra cost), however upon completion the windshield leaked a significant amount of water. I called them and they scheduled another 4 hour block of time to come back and repair it  - it still leaked! On the third attempt, they finall removed the windshield completely and reinstalled it, that did the trick, however now the weather stripping is kind of jacked up now. Unless you have hours to set aside, and weeks to get your windshield replaced correctly I would avoid Fast Glass!
__label__4	Very good place but your liquor price are fair,clean place ,fast service and ready to help you
__label__5	Great maragaritas and meal. Sizzling steak fajitas were cooked to order. Guacamole  was just as it should be. Tasted my friend's chili relleno it was fabulous. The manager Ricardo was super friendly and welcoming. Great mariachi band on Friday night. I highly recommend !
__label__1	I was inside and they had a worker shoving his hand into the ice cream machine without gloves. Regardless what he was doing, that's completely unsanitary!!
__label__5	A Must try for anyone in Tampa! My personal favorite is the steak, as well as the Diavolo pizza. The impossible meatballs were very good as well. And to finish of the meal, give the tiramisu a go! This place will not disappoint. The modern feel of the place as well as the great customer service by their server George has made this our favorite Italian Restruant in the Tampa Bay!
__label__3	For me, a dining experience is about the quality of food and the service.  The sushi here was some of the best sushi I've ever had in Philadelphia! However, holy lord the service was awful. Our waiter didn't check on us once and took forever to even ask us if we wanted a drink after being seated. I sat with an empty glass of wine and still no sign of waiter for waaaay to long. We would've stayed to order another drink & roll had service been even remotely decent but left instead.  Do take out if they do it!!!
__label__4	Chick's is a great addition to the Point Breeze/Grad Hospital neighborhood.  The establishment is always lively and full of energy, a really great and diverse crowd. It's been open a little over a year and we've been going regularly.  This last time we started off with the meatballs and they were delicious.  For the main course we had the Spaghetti & Crab, the Corn & Crab Chowder and the Tomato & Caprese salad, both were specials which I hope they carry over to the permanent menu.
__label__3	"Perhaps I am ignorant of Vietnamese food or perhaps I just expect too much out of a place that only serves soup (Pho). 

I am not sure what I am missing here from the other reviewers. The place was not exactly comfy and the Pho did not exactly have such exciting flavor. I can hardly remember its flavor to be honest and I imagine that says something. The brisket was pretty good in it but there just was not enough of it to really enjoy the enormous portion of soup given to me."
__label__1	When I came here to deal w/ family issues after Katrina, this was one of the few places open. Back then I chalked the horrible food to Katrina's impact on the city on every front. On my most recent visit, I chalk it up to just damn tasteless food. The worst back then and still is. Tourists stay away. The lines are deceiving and it's trickery at its finest.
__label__5	Best deli sandwiches on a baguette I've had since eating one in Paris years ago!! They have several unique candies and sweet treats, too. I'll definitely be returning on my next trip to Newtown!
__label__3	This place is freaking weird once you get through the barricade of love potions and bats wings you might think that you've arrived in Diagon alley and you need to buy some herbology supplies and an owl
__label__4	"Good pizza. Delicious beer. Slow service from the bar and the flight of beer (4 beers) was $14!! That's double what most places charge. 

I'll be back. I won't buy a flight."
__label__5	OMG! What a fabulous time! Our server, Justin, was fantastic! Great suggestions. Drinks were fantastic as well as food. So personable. Fill your place with such great employees and you will be around forever. Coming back again and again.
__label__2	Sushi was good but the service was lacking. The guys making the sushi were not friendly. Rarely did they even acknowledge the fact that we had ordered anything. Unfortunately I think because of the wide selection of sushi places here, I do not think we will return. The quality of the food did not make up for the less than average service.
__label__1	Should be zero. While staying at the Hampton Inn downtown Philadelphia for one week. We experienced problems with the valet each day. They were constantly begging after I refused there services became worst. On checkout day I had to wait extra long while one employee sat in the area watching Facebook on his phone. And when my car arrived someone had spit on my car. The Hampton front desk employee removed the bodily fluids from my vehicle. Poor company representation. Rude and unprofessional behavior. Using their service could land you in jail for hurting someone.
__label__4	"Cool local spot. ""Dive bar"" for sure but in a good part of town. Safe. Good drink specials and decent live music most nights."
__label__5	Very organised and great assortment. They have an atm inside the bakery but they do accept cards.
__label__5	"I love the spice baby.  Muy bueno!  
I'll drive here from now on for a breakfast burrito.  No where have i found a breakfast burro so good they are deelish...
Barbacoa burro...mmmmmmmmmmmm, that's what I had tonight. Saturday I had my first breakfast burrito and it was really deelish. ..
Thanks so much for making good food in Tucson El Pueblito!"
__label__3	"Pros: Beautiful venue. VIP seating in row A is the main thing you're paying for.

Cons: parking is horrible and will run you at least $30, and that was on a week night. It costs $13 for a tiny plastic cup of wine. $12 for a beer. VIP service was non-existent. 

Bottom line: I won't be coming back. The location is terrible and the parking/drinks are WAY overpriced. The Fillmore is 10x better."
__label__4	"Good beer, the rye IPA is my favorite. I don't like most of the pizzas, the Flammenkuche is my favorite; caramelized onion, apple smoked bacon, gruyere, creme fraiche, fresh herbs. Burgers are very good, both the beef and the vegan varieties. 

Outdoor seating is nice."
__label__2	Food was awful my family came into town and my mom got ribs and it was a tiny place, dad got the chicken fried steak which looked and tasted like cardboard and I got the taco salad which was nothing short of shredded lettuce and didn't come with meat
__label__3	This beach is good for the waves and for its relation to State St. and local businesses but I give this beach 3 stars because the last time I came here (early June 2013) the sand was scorching hot, there was a bucket load of tar, and despite the fact that the beaches are cleaned for seaweed each day there was still a ton of seaweed on the beach. Plus there was a crazy amount of sandflies and sand fleas. Overall not the best beach I've been to in Santa Barbara.
__label__1	Do not buy a dress here! I live in Haddonfield and would go anywhere but here. The sales associates are rude and do not stand by their product. Do not let this establishment ruin what she be one of the best experiences of your life.
__label__5	The pork bone broth is the best. The pork belly is very, very tender and flavorful. I feel like the toppings (including kikurage mushrooms) give great balance to the salty broth. The noodles have the right amount of texture too. The service is also extremely fast. The prices are around $11 per bowl before tax and tip. Maybe it could be a little bit cheaper?
__label__5	I had a wonderful experiences with Helping Hands.  In fact, I hired the company again just one month later.  My emails were promptly responded to.  The price for the move was fair.  They were flexible when I realized that I had underestimated the time I needed them for.  They were pleasant, respectful and careful with our belongings.  They worked quickly and efficiently.  They called me several times to let me know how they were doing for a job earlier in the day so that I could revise my window - I really appreciated their keeping me abreast.  I felt really comfortable with them.
__label__1	After getting a high volume of business, the quality of the service has deteriorated. The manager has become increasingly rude and doesn't even bother to listen to your concerns before waving you off like an irritating insect. The car washing quality has also gone down since they are constantly busy. I pay $36 for hand wax and the car is not even washed properly, let alone being waxed nicely! Clearly money has gone to their heads! Stay away!
__label__4	Fun delicious vegan options, but make sure you're not in a hurry if you visit at least around lunch time. The wait was long but we didn't have other plans, we saw many customers leave though because they didn't want to wait. We waited around 40 minutes for our food and drinks, luckily the weather was nice and the food was worth it. But yea plan for a little extra time or order ahead.
__label__2	Great martyr double IPA. Yes they serve alcohol on Sunday. Food is just okay. Wasn't too happy with my service though and the bill was suspect (not noticing until the next morning). Think my server mr. Peyton manning took advantage of the fact I was a bit tipsy. But... My fault for not double checking the bill. Worth going just to watch a game and drink beer... I'd never go back though :)
__label__1	Absolutely one of the worst meals I've ever had, way over priced, the salad bar selection was quite limited. Waste of money, I would never go again. Don't was your money going there, plenty of other good places. So disappointing. The lamb was the worst tasting things I've ever had.
__label__3	Schuette SuperValu is a nice local small town market.  It's great for when you need something quick and don't have time to travel to E'ville.  The employees have always been friendly and helpful.  The big plus for me is they often times have some hard to find beers in the cooler!
__label__5	LOVE LOVE LOVE Tiki Docks!!! They have some of the best wings in Tampa! This place is so cool inside you have to check it out. I usually get a piña colada because I'm in a tiki hut outside and that makes sense so why not but all of the drinks are yummy :)
__label__4	"For a chain restaurant, this place is really good. 

I love the ceviche and the seared ahi tuna."
__label__5	I love this mobile dog grooming company and have recommended them to my family, friends and work colleagues. First of all, they are extremely accommodating with my busy schedule. I have a 14 year old pointer that has hip issues. Dog About Town is very careful with him. Lastly, they have shown up at my house on time, to groom our dog, being the last client of they day, and the van was very clean. I expected to see a lot of hair, but I was pleasantly surprised of how clean it was.  I can't say enough good things.
__label__5	Libby was our awesome guide today for the Garden District tour!  She packed so much great information in to our tour, I loved it and will try to do another tour with them before we leave.  We did the plantation tours of Laura and Oak Alley yesterday and now they seem a bit flat compared to Libby's delivery of her tour.  It was fun and interesting.  We loved the homes in the Garden District and found the cemetery tour very interesting.  I highly recommend this tour.  YAY Libby!
__label__3	"Easy in and out. Wash was quick but did a decent job. 

 Vacuum area was a little tight. I was almost tripping over the hoses as they laid on the ground. However, the floor mat area was a nice touch and the hoses had good suction. Not covered either. 

The cost is a little cheaper than the Surf wash I usually go to, but this is where we take our work vehicles."
__label__1	So disgusted. I went in around 1pm today and ordered a sandwich, only to watch the man behind the counter use his latex glove covered hand as a tissue and then make my sandwich while several other employees looked on and didn't say a word. I hope the homeless man I gave it to enjoys my grossly overpriced sandwich. Will definitely not be back to this Cosi location.
__label__4	"Was a little reluctant to try it but was famished after a hike yesterday. But was pleasantly greeted with a friendly smile and great customer service. I ordered the sesame chicken (cooked soft/""not crispy"") and it was tasty. I will return."
__label__5	I've been watching this place on Instagram for a while. Finally decided to check it out after working out near by! Service is really good and food is tasty. I got the guava habanero waffles and cream. Another friend had breakfast burrito with sweet potato waffles and another had 1 waffle with cheese curds and a fried egg. Its a chill atmosphere with sports TVs to surround you. It appears kid and dog friendly. Some tables are outside as well.
__label__5	I've been here twice and the second time was just as good as the first. Very fresh ingredients and a friendly staff. The meals are excellent. 5 stars.
__label__1	Clock has been with him for six weeks.   Promised in three.   No call backs to four phone calls.  Not in shop on posted business hours......
__label__5	"Love the sushi here. About time Wesley Chapel!!
The Unagi is delicious. The curry is awesome. Its my new weekend thing"
__label__4	Cute new spot. Service on the slow side but the overall experience was good. Most importantly, everyone enjoyed what they got! Clean, spacious and big portions. There are healthier options on the menu also.
__label__5	"Everything on the menu is ON POINT!

Highly suggest the mac n cheese, potato gnocchi, wings, and lamb burger"
__label__3	"First time visiting Table 3 and on special Valentine's Day. To the chefs in the kitchen, the food was great!  Cocktails and wine selection, super! 
Front of the house service and servers, needs improvement. Please get them some coaching and maybe we will be back in a few months to see if things are better."
__label__5	"I cannot speak for the whole menu since I am vegan and could only order a few options of the menu, but I ordered the Tempeh Club last time I was here and it was amazing. The basil aioli sauce is so good.  Good prices and they also offer lots of drink options. 
VEGAN TEMPEH CLUB- do it! you won't regret it!"
__label__5	This place is absolutely authentic and amazing . The flavors are so nice and we ordered lots of different dishes and loved all of them. (Definitely be getting the egg rolls ). Fantastic experience !
__label__4	Very nice, very big venue for events.  We came for the home and garden show.  It took up several large areas and was really amazing all the things they can get in that place.  All the facilities here are very nice and well kept.
__label__1	The food was okay but it took 2 hours to have dinner on a Sunday night with only 3 other customers! The kebab platter comes with only ONE kebab! After sitting with our menus for a half hour, the waitress asked us if we needed a few more minutes to decide. Go anywhere else!
__label__1	"My name is Tom Campbell and my dealership purchased a vehicle from Springfield VW on 4/26/2021. We have still not received the title. I was dealing with Tom Vo but it appears that he is no longer with the company. I will need the title before I report your dealership to the state.

__label__4	Pleasantly surprised! Food was excellent! Wings, fish tacos and Cubano were ordered. Very prompt service!  Def be back
__label__2	I could use a lot of superflourous language but why would I when I can sum it up in two words. It stinks
__label__5	Great atmosphere and food. The BBQ nachos are very filling and tasty. The drinks are not your ordinary flavors. They have moonshine flights and other combinations that are different than you will find at other restaurants. The service was nice. Laid back atmosphere. Full bar. Good variety of menu choices.
__label__4	"Came in for brunch on a Sunday morning. Had a great experience. Enjoyed a pitcher of the pomegranate mimosa & the country friend steak & I chose to have my egg fried. 

I didn't give five stars because the steak was just a bit too salty. 
The mimosa however was pure MAGIC!
I will def be returning to try more stuff. 

TIP: get there early because there will be a wait."
__label__3	What can I say? It's Steak 'n Shake. Food was mediocre do was the staff, they were busy with the holiday but no need to slack on standards. That seems to be the norm at this location regardless of how busy they are.
__label__5	Don't let the outside fool you, as it doesn't look like anything outstanding. But it is! We ate here twice, once for brunch and once for dinner, during our 3-day vacation. We will definitely visit the Clear Sky again when we are back in Clearwater!
__label__1	Just received our order, after we found out that they had forgot part of order I called them back and was told by the girl on the phone that it wasn't her fault and they're not going to send the driver back. So here's one  customer who won't be ordering from this place again
__label__5	My daughter, sushi queen, said it was the first sushi she's had in Tampa that did not smell fishy. I had the curry chicken and was good to excellent. It's a small place, the people who run the place are pleasant, and it is reasonably priced. I had an Asahi beer for $3.75.  Would recommend.
__label__1	"So I've been here once or twice before and had good experiences. Today I walked in at 12:30 expecting to have a fun time and enjoy a drink or two. Instead the outside bartender rudely asked me if she could help me. People were still outside drinking, and in the past and on google maps it says it's open till 3 AM everyday. After being asked if I could be helped, I asked for a bud light and the bartender rudely replied ""no, we're closed."" Sad because I've enjoyed the bar in the past. Probably won't be returning."
__label__5	"Amy is the best! 
Super sweet and gave me a great new haircut! 
Pricing is reasonable. I'm really happy to have found a new stylist in my neighborhood!"
__label__5	Best chargrilled oysters! Their oysters are really big too like they are on steroids! Would definitely come back here!
__label__1	I paid $49.00 for a crap job. They wiped half the front of my truck, the windows were horrid I had to redo them. I called and spoke to Eric who was very nice the manager was supposed to call me back. Yeah right such bs. Oh yeah they didn't even vacuum the back seat!
__label__5	The best onion straws! My sister said the best, juiciest burger and my pork sandwich was de-lish! Great informal, friendly atmosphere too! Can't wait to go to the Friday night fish fry!
__label__5	Best burger I have had hear I was told about this place by a friend, you go in and it looks ran down but it's not
__label__4	I haven't been to a Bob Evans in ages, and really wanted to go out for breakfast. The place was semi busy, and we were able to be seated right away. The service was great and our waitress kept our coffees filled. My partner and I ordered the eggs Benedict on biscuits and it was delicious! It came with home fries (onions and peppers with it are an upcharge). I felt like we got our money's worth here and our meals filled us up. We will definitely be back!
__label__4	It was poppin' even on a Wednesday evening! I always like to try entrees that are named after the restaurant. The zinburger did not disappoint and it was delicious! The beef was cooked medium and it came out probably more like medium rare...but I actually like my meat medium rare so that was a great treat. Soft buns, juicy and flavorful meat, flavorful sauces ;) The milkshakes are on point as well! My cookies & cream shake was chock-full of oreos...yummmm.
__label__5	Gorgeous venue--- very happy that this place is here. Saw a musical here but will happily come for other performances. It's nice that it's right on the river and in such a prime downtown location as well.
__label__2	"Just so everyone is aware in the great state of PA there is an implied duty of good faith and fair dealing in every contract/agreement whether oral or written.

The Pa consumer protection laws are strong.
Unfair trade practices and consumer protection."
__label__4	Our first time here and we're fans. Good coffee which is vitally important, and a great queens something or other breakfast that'll stay with you all day...bacon, ham, egg, potatoes with chorizo gravy over the top.
__label__5	Delicious! Possibly the best scallops I've ever eaten. Great slaw. Huge plateful of fabulous onion rings. And last but far from least, their amazing lobster roll. And even better than the food, was our delightful server, Leilani. Very friendly staff and excellent service. The only downside is that we don't live in Reno. Fun place, nice people, and great food.
__label__5	Excellent service, very quick and detailed.  Owner is very helpful and seems to be quite knowledgeable.  A great experience.
__label__1	After a breakout I received from the product I never went back. The treatments were of sub standard as well. I have had better experiences and cheaper prices at Evan's relaxing station
__label__5	I LOVE THIS PLACE. It had great seafood, its clean,  and the staff are always friendly. For the amount of food you get and how much it is, makes it worth it. I always have left overs.  The service is usually fast.
__label__4	This subway does a pretty good job. They have good food an usually everything is pretty fresh. Employees are good.
__label__5	"Tried coming here at 11:20 am- it was closed. Update your hours. 

We love the food, but why come here if we can't eat the food we l"
__label__5	I love that they have all the exotic meats as well as asada and chicken. Great mexican food thats more authentic than the poser restaurants around town
__label__2	Such a disappointment! I ordered a chicken parm without pasta and they somehow interpreted it as a chicken parm sandwich. When I asked them to fix it they handed me a box to go and when I opened it i realized they had just given me the inside of the chicken parm sandwich and had only taken it out of the bread! Are you kidding?? Dry chicken and sad display. If they messed up, they should have fixed it CORRECTLY. I'm disappointed and still hungry.
__label__2	The pasta is very bland in flavor, in my opinion. French onion soup was not a soup at all, pretty much a large top of cheese and caramelized onions underneath. We got the food to go, the service was friendly and prompt. Probably won't be returning unless we eat inside. I spent $43 on two Cokes and two pastas with soups, and the most enjoyable part of the meal was the breadsticks.
__label__5	I only had their lunch buffet. The food is excellent and the spices will make your pallets dance bravo to the chef and I can't wait to try their dinner menu.
__label__4	The food, service, and atmosphere are all wonderful. This place does St. Patrick's Day right! The shepherds pie and chicken rosa were both delicious!
__label__4	This is right in the Royal Sonesta hotel and the jazz is good, so convenient for those on Bourbon Street.
__label__5	The food is incredible.  Been here now a few times.  From the pizzas to steaks. Everything is always delicious.
__label__4	Great service, food is very good, and atmosphere was welcoming. I recommend the chicken wings...and spinach stuffed shells.
__label__4	"Just a small diner on Carrollton street? Not really...
This place is SMALL, but perfect. Run by locals and everything is cooked to perfection. This is diner food...Nothing fancy, but everything is done right. The staff are great and really enjoy making you happy. If you are looking for a great old time diner experience, you can't go wrong by coming here!"
__label__4	Had so much fun singing along and cheering on daring friends. The bartenders are super friendly and fast! Will definitely be back!!
__label__4	Love the atmosphere. Went while NBA finals were on, requested they change channel and they obliged our request. Red stone burger is delicious. I will definitely return.
__label__5	Ana is great and so helpful ! She had always done all my hemming very fast and it always fits perfect ! She is so patient and always makes time for me ! Thank you !!
__label__2	The food is absolutely great. I always get the chicken alfredo and it is delightful. But in past years their customer service has gotten worse and worse. A few coworkers and I went to celebrate my birthday this past week and we waited for 40 minutes for our food and we only saw our server 3 times the whole night; to ask for our order, give us our food, and give us the check. If you have 2+ hours to spare for dinner then my all means come here for the food, just know the service won't be up to par.
__label__5	"As a first timer, this was a great experience. Went with a group of people and when we got there, the place was packed but we found a table that was perfect for us. Our server was great and knowledgeable and really helped me navigate the cigar menu. 

I felt pretty exclusively being there as the venue is nice and has a very classy vibe to it. Since I'm not huge on cigars idk how often I'd return but I'd definitely recommend this place to others."
__label__2	Went there with a friend for lunch. The place was empty at the time but the service was still super slow and our food took a long time. The pizza was burnt and gross. I also thought the menu was extremely overpriced.
__label__5	"Absolutely FABULOUS!!...the BEST hummus I've ever eaten is served at CRISP!  It comes with a side of pita bread (either white or wheat). 

I also just had a Parisian Salad Flat Bread Pizza with a side of sweet potato chips. YUM!!  

My friends had me try their Chili Cheese Falafel Burger and the Mexican Salad Flat Bread Pizza.  Everything was so fresh, all natural and delicious!!  
Can't wait to try everything on their menu!"
__label__5	You can't find better customer service, Diane Buchanan and Mgr, Lavon. Diane was so helpful and such a pleasure to work with. This is the 2nd sofa (first one sectional in 2011). Nothing is even wrong with the sectional, just going for a new look. Quality items. Thank you so much. Can't wait until March, wooo hooo
__label__1	Garbage. Possibly the worst food I've ever had. Way overpriced because of the location. I'll never make the mistake of not looking up reviews before I go somewhere again.
__label__5	The food is delicious. Best Vietnamese food I ever had. Location & price are great. I will go back again.
__label__3	My boyfriend and I sat at the outside patio to eat lunch where it was beautifully decorated and spacious. We ordered the prickly pear and a hisbicus mule, which were both just meh. My boyfriend enjoyed his south of the border burger while I was let down by the caprese flatbread. To me it was comparable to a frozen pizza I could find at a grocery store. Furthermore since we were sitting outside, our waitress hardly came by to check on us. All in all, I was disappointed in the mediocre drinks, food, and service.
__label__2	Got an XL pastrami and they completely skimped on the meat and to taste it was only sort of okay. I've been here a few times and each time has been a little worse than the last. If I pay $16 for a sandwhich I expect it to be good!
__label__3	The meat was yummy.  Service was top notch.  But the sides were dry and bland.  I had the ribs..really good.  The cornbread, mac n cheese and another side were all dry.
__label__5	Honestly, way better than the reviews give it credit for. The staff is all relatively new and really fun. They have awesome amenities and a great location (walking distance from mass ave and downtown). The pool is famous, they have two gyms (can't justify going to or paying for another one), and it is a very social and fun environment! The staff really cares about the residents and throw great events!! It is a little high in price, but compared to EVERY OTHER CITY IN THE US, this is the best deal you can get to literally live 5 minutes walking distance from a city center.
__label__5	What a great breakfast spot in downtown Tampa. I stopped over before I headed in to work. I had the english muffin with goat cheese, bacon, egg and spinach. It was delightful. Fair prices and great breakfast.
__label__1	Horrible service. Got a pedicure. Didn't even clip my cuticles or remove the dead skin. There's clear polish all over my skin. Let's see how this manicure goes
__label__5	Steve was very good about telling me up front expectations for my hair and what colors go best with my natural color and skin tone. I also decided to go shorter than i normally do by quite a bit and he did a great job with the cut. Better that anyone else who has ever tried to cut my hair short. He was also helpful with tips for care and styling. And he kept notes of what he did. By far the most thorough stylist ive ever had.
__label__1	Got the shrimp po boy...$15 for stale bread and a few shrimp with 3 slices of potato. The girl serving us treated us like she didn't want us there. I'd go down the way to Mother Natures cupboard instead. Never coming back here.
__label__5	This was the best meal I have ever had! We came for my birthday and everything was perfect. Our server was amazing. She was attentive, knowledgeable, helpful, and full of hospitality. We ordered the red fish, and shrimp and steak tartar as appetizers. It was plenty for three people. Everything was seasoned and prepared perfectly. The atmosphere was lively and inviting. I wish I could eat this well every day!
__label__4	Large Pork with Sharp.  Easy to order. Delicious to eat.  The large sandwiches come on Sarcone's bread which is one of my favorite things in the entire world.
__label__2	So I came in this place for the first time. Wasn't that crowed but I still had to wait a while for service. They were polite but the service I got (I got a fill on my acrylic nails. Gel polish) wasn't done very well for the price I paid. $30 plus a $5 tip for nails that as soon as I got home were chipped?! I'm outraged. They only get two stars because they were kind of nice and it was nice in the shop, but I will not be back!
__label__5	So love this place!!! I could eat here everyday. They have the best red gravy on the planet and when paired with their chicken parm...oh yes!
__label__5	I dine at least once a week at this Waffle House.  As always, their hash browns are beyond comparing with any other restaurants. Waffle Houses in general alway have the best hash browns. This particular one is super clean with normally a 97-99 health rating. The wait staff is always friendly. When it comes to hash browns, I'll  take mine scattered, smothered and covered. Try the biscuits and gravy, too.
__label__1	Any time I've gone to this place there are always dirty tables. They never bus tables.  Lots of take out orders and they are alwYs confused which one is which, RE bagging to correct mistakes. This time of they forgot the sauce for sweet and sour chicken.   Not going back, too dirty and unorganized.
__label__5	I wrote a very complimentary review about this dealership, very specific, with names. After a few days, it was removed to the Not Recommended junk pile. What's up with that. Maybe Yelp doesn't like too many positive evaluations. Makes you think!
__label__5	I've been coming here for tea and candles for years. Leo and Deb are the best; sometimes I go in and buy something just to tell them hi. The selection leans towards the eclectic, but it is a little more refined than other stores. There is a polish about the place that is very pleasant. You can get crystal balls, cauldrons, candles, teacups, little Buddhas...all manner of spiritual figurines. I highly recommend Aurora as a tarot reader.
__label__3	Another dinner that force's you to watch closed circuit tv commercials.  I came here to have a meal not to watch commercials .
__label__1	Went there about a Month ago. It was the worst food I ever ate. The burger was burnt to a crisp. The wings were so greasy that they slipped out of my hands. The mozzarella sticks were burnt to the point where there was no cheese in them. I will never return there.
__label__4	This place is wonderful!!! True, authentic fish and chips! I have been here a few times now. First time I got the fish and chips,and they were great. Very fresh. I went yesterday for lunch and had the Corned Beef & Swiss Sandwich ( Thinly sliced corned beef grilled and topped with Swiss cheese. Served with mayo, mustard, lettuce, tomato and onion.). All I have to say is... Amazing.
__label__4	Fresh,authentic,what can I say. If you like real Mexican street food this is your place. No other place around that can compare
__label__3	Went here for the first time based off the glowing reviews and I loved my nails when I left the day they were done, but the nail tech put gel top coat over my SNS dip for some reason and they started peeling within two days. I called and let them know and she fixed it easily, but I shouldn't have had to go back to have them fixed like that to begin with. I likely won't be back just due to the level of disappointment with how my nails started peeling within two days and I spent so much on them.
__label__5	"Healthy food to help you detox from the night before (but don't be fooled -- this was one of the best meals we ate in NOLA, and we ate everywhere). Crab cake with poached egg? Divine. And the gluten-free pancakes were extreme. I'd been supposed to share but while Lala was in the bathroom, I ate them all. No lie. 

Averill was charming and funny and absolutely no-nonsense. She was as good for the soul as the food was to our sad, abused, hungover bodies."
__label__5	I loved visiting this brewery.  The staff was friendly and knowledgeable. They recommend beers that were just what I wanted. Beers are very affordable. Fyi you must watch an educational video due to ridiculous NJ laws. Not long though. Staff was so friendly. Talked with TJ for a long time about different breweries and beers from around the country. Great time and conversation.
__label__3	"This review is specifically about a sales associate in the health and wellness department.   I told this man that I was looking for probiotics to take as I was on antibiotics.   Before ""helping"" me, he proceeded to give me a long lecture on the evils of antibiotics and what they do for your gut.  I didn't ask for this ""advice"" nor was I ignorant about antibiotics - after all I was there to purchase probiotics to counter the antibiotics.  It was my first time to this store and it definitely soured the shopping experience for me.  Frankly, he was a jerk."
__label__4	My friend Gary S. introduced me to 3P and I love it!  I'm there about once a week now and usually get the De La Guerra and as many pickles into that little paper bag as possible.  I love the combo of flavors available on the menu and the atmosphere.  Lots of local professionals and tourists are enjoying the tastiness!  Parking can be tricky and I often have to circle the block at least once to find a spot.
__label__1	Racial prejudice!!! They are only nice to white guests. None of my friends are satisfied with their service.
__label__5	The staff worked with us both with our budget and to create the perfect award. I would recommend this to anyone looking for good work and fast results.
__label__1	"Stopped in spur-of-the -moment to see the new electric Mustang. Well, the sales staff could have cared less! No one helped me, everyone looked like they were in the Mafia and gave me one word responses. Do you want to sell     a car or what? Obviously NOT! The customer service SUCKS and the sales people could care less. Unbelievable. Do yourself a favor nd do NOT waste your time there. They simply don't care! I was ready to buy, too! Not from here, NOPE! You guys SUCK!
TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! THE WORST OF THE WORST!"
__label__5	Highly recommend. Jessica is super knowledgeable and friendly. The first session took maybe 10 minutes and was painless!
__label__5	"Returning customer at least 10x because it's The best in the area for comfort, customer service and great mani-pedis

Clean too !"
__label__5	Very helpful and had everything I needed. Went to make my daughters tutu and they had all the fabric in every color
__label__2	I went to get my teeth cleaned and I was just there in November and got x-rays and they wanted to d  ok then again I politely said no not this time the tech then cleaned my teeth she then went to get the dentist and he flipped out on her because I didn't get x-rays  I felt bad for her but I was thrilled I didn't have to hear the bullshit dentist's give you .  The dentist acted like a child  getting a toy taken away from him.
__label__5	Great service! Friendly, informative, honest, affordable and hospitable. The entire experience was great and I will definitely be going back. I would recommend to everyone. (Honda & Toyota maintenance & repair)
__label__3	"If you get the chance, pick up good before you get to the airport because the options once you get through security are laughable. Which is disappointing considering the airport is so close to the foodie city of NOLA. 

Aside from that, our experience was fine - staff throughout the airport was friendly, security moved quick enough, and the bathrooms were clean. Overall a decent enough experience but the lack of food option definitely left a sour taste in our mouths."
__label__5	"Great food 
Huge portions
Great price
Reminds me of  Los Aztecas  before they raised prices and cut their portions."
__label__5	The building is well designed with incredible exhibition.  Even my 2 little ones LOVED the exhibit.  I know it's not really a place for little kids, we were able to spend some time talking about what some of the beautiful glassworks resembles and all sorts of imaginations appears with the help of Chihuly's collection.  Our favorites were there boat with glass balls.  The kids said it resembles the solar systems and the memories cores from the Inside/Out movies.
__label__2	"Me and my friends enjoy coming here during our lunch break which is only 45 minutes. Almost every time we go they make one of our drinks wrong. Which is not a big deal, except we have to wait for it to be remade and that has made us late for our class after lunch several times. I'm just a nice white girl that wants to get my Starbucks on and also be on time for class. 

Ps. The redeeming quality of this establishment is the cute boys"
__label__2	I am going to start with, My husband said the Sushi was good. I ordered the Beef Yaki Udon and it was bland and gooey. Not good at all. I would have given one star if he didn't like the Sushi. Also the waitress didn't refill drinks nor did she visit the table as much as she should have.
__label__5	"First Fri short films are worth looking forward to every month and they are free! Honestly I have a short attention span and don't enjoy going to a ""normal"" length movie, so this is perfect for those of us with ADD. Attention span aside, if you like independent films this should be on your list."
__label__5	"Super fun time. Chase and Captain Slade were the best & will take good care of you!!
Ride was a little bumpy because of the weather but Slade was very reassuring and safe.  A great time was had with all!"
__label__2	The restaurant was recommended by locals that worked at our Clearwater Hotel. The wait staff was very accommodating and helpful. Good wine list at reasonable prices...but the kicker is that  the food unfortunately was not good at all. The sauce for the pasta and eggplant is comparable to Prego. In addition I'm sure my eggplant was cooked.....just not right when I ordered it. Overall dinner was not good.
__label__5	"I used this company when I arrived in Philadelphia from Chicago to a very dirty house that I was renting.  They sent over two guys, I was able to make an appointment with very little notice.  They were professional, courteous, and even moved a dresser for me that the previous tenant left inside the house!  After they cleaned the rooms and the carpeted stairs the house looked great and smelled so fresh and clean.  
I will definitely be using them again."
__label__3	i thought their pizza was good until i read the reviews. it is cheap only 7.99 for large three topping.i came to USA recently and this is the place i go whenever i need a pizza. i have no idea how a pizza should taste so i think it is good.if anybody know a better pizza place let me know.thanks :)
__label__5	"I don't usually do juices, I'm a smoothie girl by heart BUT this is my type of spot. I loved the atmosphere, decor and location. There were several juices to choose from and you can even have them make one with ingredients you choose. I had the breakfast sandwich and Pretty In Pink. My niece had the  Valley Girl. We sampled several others and were very pleased. 

The customer service was perfect. I felt really comfortable asking her all of my questions and she was very knowledgeable. I will be back."
__label__5	Tracy is awesome.  She takes such good care of us when we come and knows exactly how we like things!  They will make the dishes anyway you want!
__label__5	Best experience we have had here for lunch. Brittni is always a joy and the food was delicious. Get spicy garlic
__label__5	WOW just wow! This place was a nearby place I found while driving from the airport to my sisters house. The tacos were absolutely delicious but what was my favorite of all was the bowl of Mexican corn! Loved it so much we ordered a bowl to go! Service was great, food was great, overall a wonderful experience! Highly recommend this place!!!!
__label__5	"Surprisingly delicious, healthy generously portioned food!  Perfect coffee.  Music playing was a little contentious-- some kind of modern rock/ metal station playing System of a Down-- seemed out of place in the environment.  But I won't dock a star for that...

Tofu scramble is STELLAR."
__label__3	I loved hanging out at Old Point, especially the patio. This is definitely a nicer restaurant and I like what they did with the decor. However, much of the food is basically over priced bar food though. I was also disappointed with the lack of gluten free options for someplace that was more high end.
__label__4	Beautiful! Amazing! Priced way out of my budget! Great place to see if you are in town!
__label__3	decent outlet stores. i'm not a fan of the outdoor set-up; i prefer actual outlet malls. it's also quite a hike from Philly.
__label__3	This is a great location for gas and on-the-go stuff from their mini mart. The gas is a bit cheaper and they have a nice selection inside the store. Plus, it has easy access back onto I-10.
__label__3	I'm not saying I didn't eat every bit of my vanilla cone, but I'm not sure what the hold up was. The line was vey short but I still stood there waiting for 10 minutes. Hire another person? Good ice cream but if perfection takes time, let's get another scooper.
__label__2	"We had 2 salads. Greens in both salads were old and disgustingly slimy.
We sent the salad back and the replacement was just as bad."
__label__4	"I will say that this place for being in Philly really surprised me. I had the ""plato typico"" and I will say it was like being in south America again. Very large portions so you could probably split this plate with some one. I will be back next time I'm in Philly"
__label__5	I was very hesitant to take my cat to a groomer since she is literally a scaredy cat. So I decided to give Aussie a call. It not only was convenient but fairly priced as well. Annmarie was friendly, patient and kind. I was very impressed with this service and would highly recommend them to anyone.
__label__2	Waited 10 minutes to have our order taken, another 45 minutes to have food on the table. Very much overpriced-- for $15-20 you get lots of carbs and sauces but 3rd world portion of proteins, no more than a few tiny slices of meat in every dish. There are definitely better Thai restaurants to choose from.
__label__5	"Love this neighborhood favorite. Never had a bad meal, ever!

Service is especially nice - they are always kind and patient with my 95 yr old mother ( She LOVES their desserts. - We share ). 
Cocktails are very nice too."
__label__3	It's not a bad place to chill for a happy hour - the pool tables, TV screens, and ample space is always good. The slightly inflated bowling prices are bad. Also it's impossible to get a drink (maybe things have changed?) as there's always a mob by the bar until the happy hour is over. You'll love this place, hate it, or straddle the fence like me.
__label__3	My dad was in this facility for 2 months and there are good and bad things about his stay. He did make a lot of progress from his injuries, the doctor was very informative with us and I love that visiting hours are 24hrs a day. Most of the front desk personnel were very friendly! Now concerning the staff there were definitely some amazing nurses that made my dad feel loved and cared for, but there were a select few who would ignore his calls for a long period of time where he would have to call me so I could call the nurses station to get someone to attend to him.
__label__5	Great location and has free on site parking, which is a major plus.  Wait staff was very friendly and attentive.  Loved the bruschetta and sausage and pepper pizza.  We sat outside with our one year old who enjoyed the scenery while we enjoyed our food.  Relaxed but upscale.  We'll definitely be back.
__label__1	I ordered door dash and I got bang bang shrimp, I didn't ask for sauce on the side and I got it on the side and there was barley any sauce in the container. Door dash is not cheap and this basically ruined my meal. I don't understand why somebody would just decide to put the sauce on the side on their own.
__label__1	DO NOT take your dog here.  Brought dog in for a simple trim and when I picked him up he had three cuts from the trimming device that they use.  UNACCEPTABLE!!!  This place is completely unprofessional because they never noticed what they did.  I will tell everyone I know that owns a dog to NEVER go in this horrible place.  Jason is a hack.
__label__4	I've heard about Martin's for a while since moving to Nashville, so it only took a year or so to actually try it. We got the smoked Turkey sandwich, potato salad, and broccoli slaw. Overall the Turkey was decent, but the size of the sandwich was underwhelming. The pictures on the menu looked way bigger. Regardless, the sandwich was good. Sides were better IMO. I'll definitely give it another go.
__label__1	Bullshit bullshit bullshit. This mcdolands makes us wait extremely long for our order.... Me and my husband .....come multiple times and they had to redo my order because they got something wrong and OR forgot something..... they have a lot of attitude and don't do there jobs correctly very upsetting. Don't ever come here it's horrible :/ I've never been to such an awful McDonald's ...
__label__4	A family owned spot on Magazine St.  we went here on a recommendation from our tour guide on the local spot for oysters. And the oysters were very yummy.  We order two dozen oysters and we didn't realize how large and plump they would be.  I barely finished them.  We also tried the chargrilled oysters.  I loves them but they were too buttery for my hubby's taste.  I needed more bread to soak up the buttery broth.  We are happy we found this local gem.
__label__4	This place remains tops for us.  Crowded and worth the wait.  Wait staff is right on top of things and the food is amazing.  When we go, we just go with  appetizers and their amazing beer list, so can't say much about the rest of the menu.
__label__2	Cute shirts, but obviously built for the tourists.  I have a problem paying $22.00 for a tank that says Philly.  The staff was friendly; the store was very clean and organized... just a little overpriced for my touristy tastes!
__label__5	Absolutely the best brunch I had. Drinks are amazing and food is delicious. Fair warning no kid friendly music here, but best adult get away/ girls day spot. Energy, vibe, and food are 100% worth the wait and you can get a great drink while you wait. The GM Katie was personable and amazing. Definitely go get Drunk Bitch and have a Thick bitch. You won't be disappointed! Emotions was my favorite drink.
__label__4	Mike always gets your car done on time, thoroughly, and at a competitive price.   Only slight negative is that he has gone ahead and done some minor repairs without checking with me first - best bet is to make clear to him that you want a call if any repair will cost more than some pre-agreed amount.  At the end of the day, I trust that I will not get ripped off, which means I'll certainly keep going back.
__label__4	Their hours are early for the weekend because of Covid. We ate at the outside bar. Nice atmosphere and live music were a plus! The grouper nuggets and Hogfish Sandwich (not on the menu ask for it) were so yummy. Blackened shrimp tacos were good, but left me wanting to steal hubby's sandwich! We will be back!
__label__5	Great staff, very professional,  awesome service. I highly recommend this place! Yvonne and her staff made the process painless and I have nothing but positive things to say about the level of quality service I have recieved.  Minor maintenance issues were resolved in a professional and timely matter. The apartments have nice layouts.  Great amenities (pool, hot tub, 24 hour gym with a cool view to name a few) The location is very convenient as you are minutes from downtown and SOHO. Don't let the negative reviews discourage you as it is absolutely no reflection of my personal experience!
__label__2	Quoted my wife $220 for a fill valve replacement and $550 for a flange replacement on a separate toilet. Thank god she said no.
__label__5	Great bar/café! Such a great place to hang, inside is beautiful and outside you can hear nice music while having a coffee and a cig! Definitely coming back! Loved it
__label__4	I ended up here, starving and hangry, after a nearby brunch place had an hour wait. The man behind the counter recommended a burger and beer and who can turn that down?? The food was served fresh and fast (which at the time was an actual dream). I would totally go back anytime... although the man who worked there did hit on my friend and me as we were leaving which was a little odd but maybe it was southern hospitality?
__label__5	Been going to the Gallery since I was a kid. Great steaks. The chicken cheese steak is amazing. They season it really well. The fries could be better. Sicilian pizza is always great.
__label__1	NO DINING ROOM SERVICE!       REALLY?       Nice food, but who wants to eat good food in the car?        Won't be back until they open the dining room.     We used to go at least once a week, now with this silliness, not in the last several months.        Foolish way to do business.  Driving your customers to other restaurants is BAD BUSINESS!
__label__5	Great Pho- so pleased to find this little gem, will definitely be back ! Just moved from Pennsylvania and we were worried we wouldn't find good Vietnamese restaurants like we had back home - this was our first try here in Clearwater - it did not disappoint.
__label__5	Came here a couple weeks ago. Bartender was friendly and knowledgeable. Music and decor is swank. All three in my party loved every cocktails. Burgers were fantastic. Great experience. Pricey! But expected.
__label__4	"Most comfortable bed and pillows. Liking the understated modern room decor. Perfect temp shower. Name ""Nashville airport"" is a little deceiving if you are accustomed to Marriotts actually located on airport campus like Philly or Tampa, etc. This one is located near the airport and requires a shuttle off property. 
Has all the amenities you could want for business or leisure trip. A bit pricey.   Two thumbs up for a splurge and convenience. Very accommodating and friendly staff"
__label__5	Might be the single best steakhouse in town!  Amazing cuisine, expert cocktails, perfect service!  But you do pay for it.  Don't expect a bargain just because it's in the Western Village, but the price is well worth it in the overall dining experience.  The only downside is having to walk through the rest of a rather shady casino to get to it!
__label__5	So happy to finally have an authentic Italian restaurant in Franklin! Everything his fresh made daily by the owner. The bread is to die for. I highly recommend the caprese salad, salmon and straw and hay dish. Not for those who are in a hurry but for those who love a true authentic Italian dining experience. The owner came out to talk to us for a while which was really nice. We will be back:)
__label__5	Oh my gosh - help when we needed it and advice for next time!!  Matt offered to help when we pulled into the station with a low tire air light.  We didn't have a tire gauge and when I asked if we could buy one from them he put air in the tires for us and let us know how the tire indicator worked and when the air pressure might be of concern.  He offered to air them up again if we needed it.  We gas up at this station all the time but have not had to request help before.  Matt's help was unexpected and greatly appreciated- great customer service!!
__label__5	My fiancé and I visit Ballyhoo monthly. We love their mussels diablo and the shrimp flatbread. The service is always good and the food never disappoints. I enjoy the atmosphere of the restaurant as well.
__label__2	Has been hit or miss. Ordered an rueben and a turkey club for pick up and when I got home they were made on  hoagie rolls???!!!
__label__3	"We had never been here before and my research was just enough to see a variety of tacos, bowls, burritos and salads that got good reviews. 

I had a grilled chicken salad bowl and my husband had a fish burrito.  We enjoyed the food but the dining experience was not what we relate well to. 

You pick your meals right inside the front door , then go get your fountain drink and wait to hear your meal table tag called. Then you go pick up your meals. The music is a bit loud and the restaurant dining is similar to fast food eateries.

Again, our food was good."
__label__4	The food here is pretty good, the service is likewise. They need a larger and more updated menu but other than that I'd recommend it. The prices are fair and the food decent.
__label__4	It took about an hour to get through the traffic. It only took 5-10 minutes to drive down Candy Cane Lane. But it, and Angel Avenue, and many of the houses on the surrounding streets, are worth a trip. I may make it a tradition.
__label__5	I just want to give the highest compliments to the staff here.  We had a little issue that was out of their control but they were more than accommodating and we appreciate it. Not to mention how delicious the food was. We had the scallops and Scalibut and they were cooked perfectly. Myself and my sister enjoyed the environment and the food for her birthday. Special thanks to Marlon the floor manager and Tori who was our server for the excellent service.  FYI if the staff see this review (Larry).
__label__2	"Like any cheaper hotel, you get what you pay for. Very affordable and close to where we needed to be. My stay wasn't terrible, but there were some things I noticed which impacted my rating.

The beds were fine. Not uncomfortable by any means.

In the bathroom, I noticed the toilet needed to be cleaned, and the ceiling above the shower looked like it had mold."
__label__5	One of our favorite burger joints!! Steamed buns, farm-raised beef, great Parmesan aioli fries! And CJ is our favorite! She's super friendly and personable!
__label__5	Being from California and enjoying the more non-traditional Po-Boys this is my favorite Po-Boy in the city! I love the the grilled shrimp and fried green tomato Po-Boy the best, and the remoulade that comes on that is to die for. We've been in several times when the beer was 2 for 1 as well so that sweetened the deal. I wish it was open on Sudays because for some reason that's when we seem to crave it.
__label__5	Fast, friendly service with a variety of sauces. So many choices in fact it's hard to choose what the get! The Wing Wednesday deal is hard to pass up but the regular menu prices are very reasonable especially when ordering 20 or more wings. These are some of the best in East Nashville...not overly breaded or sauced and never dried out. Highly recommended.
__label__5	Loved Pats!! Loved the workers (who were so friendly, welcoming and funny) as well as the food. Got the steak sandwich with onions and whIz. No wait and once ordered I got the sandwich in less than a minute. The steak was your typically shredded beef for Philly cheesesteaks, which was delicious. The whiz didn't overwhelm the sandwich at all and the bread was very good. Not too soft and not too hard. Can't wait to come back soon.
__label__4	This may be my favorite Chinese restaurant! I recently moved and am so glad they deliver to my new address. The grandpa chicken, seafood soup, seafood rolls are great. I gave them 4 stars because I feel like sometimes they don't bring their A game when cooking.  However, 99% of the time it's delicious
__label__3	"Before visiting Santa Barbara, I did some research about what restaurants to visit. This was at the top of the list.

After a day of wine tasting, we were looking forward to great food. The main courses were underwhelming and so were the drinks. 

The only 2 dishes we liked were appetizers: the Brussel sprouts & oysters.

It's definitely trendy and hip. I give this place 3 stars for appetizers and ambiance."
__label__5	They did a fantastic job on our termites. They use the best products and the termites are now gone. They also did my airduct cleaning my house smells amazing. It helped with my heating and cooling cost and I breath so much better. Thank you healthy home.
__label__2	The staff offered me water while my wife and daughter had an exam for sore throat.  My senses told me the wating area was musty.  Smell like damp basement.  Well see what testing and treatment are.  Desk staff seem knowledgeable.
__label__4	The ham steak with caramelized bananas was amazing.  I love it.  Service was quick and friendly, the place is busy on a Sunday morning but they were turning tables quickly.  I would definitely go back.
__label__5	Very relaxing atmosphere and outstanding staff. I go here to get my brows waxed and Rochelle and Piper always do such excellent work and are so kind and friendly. I have thick, unruly eyebrows which require extra work but they never seem rushed. This is the only salon in Nashville that I'd recommend.
__label__5	The tofu biscuit sandwich was delicious,  so I'll definitely be back next time I have a craving for some Southern comfort food! Also make sure to get their number through Google (not Yelp) and order by phone (rather than online) for the best pricing. (It's not the restaurant's fault; it's something Yelp and Grub Hub do to make money off businesses.)
__label__1	"Took our Ford Edge for right rear tire check, we were told screw in white wall and needed to replace all four tires since they couldn't replace just one.
Took the car to Discount Tire, small screw, repaired and rebalanced at no charge.

BrakeMax on 1st Avenue, dishonest"
__label__5	I wouldn't take my family heirlooms anywhere else. The staff always go above and beyond to take care of me! They are attentive, friendly and above all trustworthy.
__label__5	Top 10 restaurants ever in food, atmosphere and service. Scallops and pork belly are out of this world.
__label__5	Extremely kind craftsman with rapid and knowledgeable service. I am extremely pleased with the work completed on my jewelry.
__label__5	The food here is really good. They make Italian and Gourmet American taste heavenly! Also the interior design is beautiful! I love the use of asymmetry and lightening design.
__label__2	We were excited about this one, because we had been to an Anthony's Coal Fired in CT that we loved. Unfortunately here the pizza was not good. How can a pizza be burnt and underdone at the same time? Maybe it was an inexperienced baker, but MEH, it was very pedestrian. We won't be back.
__label__2	The place would be so much better if smoking were not allowed indoors. The prices were good, though: $1.25 for PBR on draft.
__label__5	Good southern food, loved the cat fish, grits, tomato gravy, fried green tomatoe, okra, you name I loved it all. Delicious yum yum yummy. Just visiting from Seattle, WA
__label__1	"Pharmacy staff is rude and disrespectful. I only filled my prescription here because cvs was out of stock - in the future- I'll wait for CVS and you should too. Being a former Walgreens employee I get the job can get stressful but that doesn't give you the right to be nasty to customers. 

I recommend firing the whole staff and starting from scratch. Just sad."
__label__5	Love the food. Large portions. Drinks are yummy! Make sure to get on the waitlist before you go.  Dry popular place. It is worth the wait.
__label__4	"Sooo good! 
Had the muffuletta and it was really delicious! Fun atmosphere and great bar food!"
__label__5	Great food but ohhhhhh it is HOT!!! In all the right ways!!! Hot chicken is a must have when in Nashville & this is a great spot!
__label__1	A month later and numerous phone calls later, no one seems to be able to do anything about this. The Customer Service people say to call the bank handling their credit card and the bank says to call the credit bureau, please hold someone who actually gives a damn will be with you in a moment...
__label__1	I brought my cousin here for her 21st birthday and we waited in line. My friend gave the worker at the line a compliment and he told her our group was no longer welcome. He was by far one of the rudest person I have ever met. If you want to have a good time, DO NOT COME HERE.
__label__5	"I attended a bridal shower at the Country Club. Only complaint is that it is impossible to find on your phone maps. I had a terrible time trying to find it (I had never been there before) it took me to the far end, where there was no entrance. I eventually had to call the host to get more descriptive directions and go about a mile in the other direction. 

The food and views are amazing. I would definitely go back! The golf course is very well kept and clean."
__label__5	Gina is incredible at creating an online presence that is more than just your website.  She helps you to understand how social media, branding, blogging, and links are imperative to making your business thrive in an overly saturated online world.  If you want to get yourself known, give Fat Eyes a try.  You won't be disappointed.
__label__5	Dr. Freeman is a incredible loving caring man. His true compassion for his Love of animals is beyond words. His staff is outstanding as well. they're all kind caring and compassionate. Dr. Freeman sits down and explains at all levels of options and procedures for you to understand clearly. I Highly recommend Them all if you want someone to love your babies just as much as you do. Thank you all especially Dr Freeman. Danie. Shelby and Cindy.
__label__5	I had my first COVID-19 appointment a couple of weeks ago. I'm pleased to say that the team at Just Hair is taking every precaution to keep both the clients and styling team safe. Lee Ann is an artist. My hair looks and feels great!
__label__3	good spot to go for lunch. cafeteria style Chinese buffet if you need something quick. pretty decent hot and sour soup.
__label__3	"I love that they always have big portions, but certain things transpire to make me sad about the direction this establishment is heading. 

They don't make chili anymore.  How was that ever even a consideration to be in the cards. That's like Burger King nixing the whopper.  

Our waitress got a few things wrong on the first go around, but she was pretty quick to rectify the mistakes. 

At least there was no wait compared to the 40 minute line at cheddars...

Update: still no chili bread bowl. Sad."
__label__1	"This is probably the worst coffee establishment I have visited.  The coffee tastes terrible.  We ordered two mochiattos that were basically double shot espresso with milk in it.  The banana bread was dry and had a terrible after taste.  The brownies for the kiddos were like bricks.

For the price of the coffee, it should have been the best I ever had.  I had to get a smoothie to get the terrible taste out of my mouth."
__label__5	"Excellent food
 sides are small for how much you pay you only get a small cup must try the pork steak I had the chicken also and it was good but I give the pork steak a"
__label__2	"Have heard great reviews for this place so decided to give it a try. First time experience.
We got this delivered via Uber Eats. We live around the block so distance isn't an excuse. Our Pizza was LOADED with Tomatoes (part of the recipe but holy crap every inch had tomatoes) which in turn made the dough SO soggy. The flavor was sub par and just not good. So disappointed considering our delivery was over $60 and now most places are closed. Crappy Friday night!"
__label__5	The new store looks great it's clean and fresh and fully stocked I found exactly what I was looking for at a very reasonable price
__label__4	Second time at Domingo's and still a fan. Great breakfast, family run. Next time I'm in town will be there again.
__label__4	Very clean and very safe location.  Lotsa construction going on but we could not hear it. The bed was so comfy I wanted to just keep sleeping. A little pricey but worth it for the location. Super friendly staff..loved the Nathan fellow hard worker. If we ever go to Nashville again we will stay here for sure. To cold to check out the pool but looked very clean. Did not wake up in time for free breakfast. Tv has a zillion channels and wifi was spotty.
__label__5	So I loved Jasmine Thai when they were on Westshore, but the new location on S. Dale Mabry is Awesome! Besides still serving great food at a reasonable price, they now have a full liquor bar. The staff is always friendly and the food is always good. Can't wait to go back again! :)
__label__5	"Fantastic cakes and donuts! And the service is always friendly and helpful!

I stoped by today to order a cake and Courtney was extremely patient and helpful."
__label__1	Assholes. Never use em again. They just got Uber in Boise..will be nice to have a much better service in Boise
__label__1	Bus broke down. It smelled funny even before it started it's route. Driver knew that something was wrong and still proceeded. Battery died on a cold, dark, rainy highway. Dangerous situation. Company treats people like cattle.
__label__2	Definitely not authentic Mexican food!  Ordered a wet burrito aka Burrito Mojito with chicken. Barely any sauce and the tortilla was cold not cooked at all so when you bite into the end is like chewing on a rag. Wife ordered a crispy taco and was overcooked. Ingredients decent but lacked flavor. Overpriced for what you get. Service was good, wait staff were friendly, ambiance was nice.
__label__5	I had two chicken tacos and two pork tacos on soft corn tortillas with onion and cilantro. Also put lime and their hot taco sauce. The simplicity of the taco and the well seasoned meat was VERY GOOD. Going back for more very soon. Four tacos made the perfect meal. Seemed pretty authentic.
__label__5	I visited the new Paoli location. BIG selection of tasty donuts. It's about time--the cardboard impostors found at Dunkin are so lame compared to these beauties. Salted Caramel, Bacon Maple, Lemon--now you're talking my language. Breakfast sandwiches, muffins, and bagels, oh my.
__label__5	From my first little Saturn to my fourth car now this location will always be where I come! Always great service!
__label__1	I was not thrilled with this location. The doctor rushed through my appointment. I came back a week later after wearing the trials she gave me and told her I wasn't seeing that well out of them. She actually argued with me telling me that I saw 20/20 when I left last week. Well she rushed through the appointment once again and her frustration was obvious. Needless to say... I still couldn't see. Avoid this place!! I ended up going to the oracle and wetmore location and had a great experience. The doctor there is knowledgeable and thorough.
__label__2	I'm surprised by the high rating for this place.  The decor is very nice and clean.  The buffet was pretty blah.  We came back and decided to order take out and it was no better.  Way overpriced and seemed to be more concerned with appearance than the quality of the food.
__label__3	Place is very nice. Good for conversation.  I ordered the Herbie burger mentioned that i like medium but last time i was there it was way under cooked.  This time it was burnt as you can see in the pic. Wish they would get it correct
__label__5	Consistently clean and beautifully decorated for the holidays!   The signage is very well done.   Many restaurants to choose from.  The HVAC works well so that the myriad smells aren't overwhelming when walking by.   The employees are professional and appear to be happy to work there.  Always relaxing to look out the windows at the runways which seem very well planned and not over-crowded.
__label__3	Sonic drinks are the most delicious, sips of greatness, I could ever drink. There food, on the other end, is repulsive. One time I ordered a grilled cheese, and they forgot to put cheese in it... it was just two slices of toasted bread.
__label__5	"Great pizza and friendly service.  
Awesome bar inside for drinks! 
Great addition to downtown Clearwater"
__label__4	Finally! A diner close to home with great food, friendly service and great prices! The homemade biscuits and gravy are to die for!! Home fries like grandma used to make. We will be back - I want to try the burgers and pizza. Plus I know the kiddos will love it here!!
__label__1	I've been here a few times but tonight was horrible. I went out for a cigarette and they chased me down for the bill. When I came back they wouldn't serve me again. I only came here to meet up with a friend who was back visiting for birthday. Me and my boyfriend go there early and had dinner. We spent a good amount. We tipped well. I didn't have time with my friend. I feel insulted. I'll never go back.
__label__1	"Wtf is with that atrocious ""4D"" experience? Instead of going here I recommend saving yourself $20 and get someone to punch your kids in the kidneys a few times. Short selection of insects, no opportunity to actually hold any bugs, whatever."
__label__5	I've been having my Forester serviced here for years.  Great service and attention to detail.  Never any issues.  I've always felt my car has been serviced properly and for a fair price.
__label__4	"One of my favorite places to take out-of-town guests. They have a good ""southern"" menu with something for everyone in a fun atmosphere. Food is reliability good and occasionally you can catch some live music. 

Expect very long waits on Sundays and popular nights."
__label__3	The grocery section was out of everything from milk to sandwich meat to fresh vegetables to frozen vegetables. There's no excuse for this. The staff was super friendly, but while we're in Nashville, we'll be choosing another Walmart or other grocery store.
__label__5	This is an older style LaQuinta but the rooms are nice. The beds are very comfy and the room has a desk and two chairs so we can use our computer while sitting at the desk (the motel has wi-fi). The room also has a micro and a fridge so we can keep cold drinks and snacks. All of the members of the staff are great, professional and friendly.
__label__4	Very good burgers, cooked perfectly! The only downside is the milkshakes, they are amazing, but for the price you do not get a very big portion. I realize it's handmade ice cream and again it is delicious, but u felt like a clown trying to lick the inside if the glass since I finished it in about 5 minutes with my burger. Two can easily split an order of fries if you are town in the mood.
__label__1	Ordered at 5:25 food was not received 7:40. It took over 2 hours to receive our food. I called and asked about our order, person in charge said they were short, but offered a discount but this food was not worth waiting two hours for even with appreciated 30%  discount. Probably the first and last time I order here.
__label__4	This is a really neat place to go - we tell our friends about this place.  Have enjoyed it several times with different friends.  We recommend!
__label__5	Our experience with Just Water Heaters was GREAT! They are a very professional and easy to work with company. My wife and I researched them extensively and their reviews are excellent, as well. From the Roberto who answered our call to the expert plumber, Alan, everyone was polite and courteous. The replacement of our 25 year old Bradford White water heater with another BW was performed on time and very satisfactorily. We strongly recommend Just Water Heaters, Tucson, AZ.
__label__5	Shopping around for tires, I called American Tire Depot. Armando the manager was very helpful over the phone. He price matched the lowest price in town. Armando and his team were very professional. He informed me that they are now a full auto repair shop and showed me some other things my truck was in need of. There was never any pressure to do additional work, just suggestions. After four new tires I was out of there in a timely matter, for being a crazy Friday afternoon.  Overall I will be going back to American Tire Depot for my truck needs.
__label__3	product was good, but service was just ok. i arrived at 11:10 for a pickup that was scheduled at 11am. they didnt have it ready and i stayed until 11:25 to pick it up.
__label__5	The waitresses here are all very kind and fast, and the food is the best. The prices are cheap and you get a TON of food. With an entree you get soup & salad, the entree, 2 vegetables,  and desert all for one price. It isn't usually crowded and has fast service. I always have leftovers to take home. My only complaint is that the parking lot is small and hard to maneuver, but that is due to the location.
__label__4	"Very clean spot but it smells like a nail shop in here! I was overwhelmed with the smell of nail acrylic.
There's a nail shop next door and the ventilation is not so good but the bubble tea was amazingly delicious.
Everyone was friendly upon arrival."
__label__1	Starved rite now 10 30 they r open 2 1100 keep getting disconnected    not 1100 yet  live on the ridge. B there in 2 min  they went answer. Dont b hungry n call them
__label__1	Avoid this place if you can. I got in late and didn't have many options for food so I figured I'd give the hotel restaurant a try. The waitress was super rude to me before I even ordered my food. I waited over an hour for a sandwhich and soup which was then served cold!!! No apologies were given she just told me they'd been really busy. I complained to the front desk of the hotel and was told they would speak with a manager and get back to me and nothing was ever done. Not impressed.
__label__3	Line was crazy long, pizza was average.  Not great, not terrible.  Just one of those places you end up when you're in a resort the size of Gaylord.  Not a place to go out of your way to get to.
__label__1	I really wanted to like the food- the menu sounds amazing! What I ended up with was a burger with two super salty patties, a bun so hard it couldn't be eaten, and maybe a teaspoon of the toppings that sounded so delicious in the description.
__label__1	Aweful!! Awful!! Just moved to the area and was looking for a new place to eat.  My family went to Minella's Diner yesterday and the food was awful.  My burger was dry.  My son ordered the pancakes and he said they had no taste at all.  The service was good.  Our server was a nice lady but the food made us wish we had rode on by this place. DO NOT GO HERE IF YOU LIKE GOOD FOOD!!!
__label__5	Great place! Had a hole in my tire and got it patched. It was fast and friendly service.
__label__1	Food is terrible. I was slightly intoxicated and still felt like I ate dog food so that's saying somethin..
__label__5	Jerry is great! Whitman is a friendly family-owned pharmacy!  Oh - and their selection of Asher's chocolates is remarkable!
__label__4	Very pleasurable service. The boss hog burger was very flavorful, well prepared, good tasting smoked pork and nice bbq sauce.
__label__5	Wow! This place is great! Can't say I've ever had pizza like this before, the crust and sauce are simply like no other I've ever had! I ordered the Burbon Street Special and wasn't disappointed in the slightest. The toppings are mesh together in perfect harmony and deliver such a great tangy flavor! I wish I were local, I'd probably order a pie once a week.
__label__1	Deserves 0 stars! Worst papa johns I've ever had. They made the pizza incorrectly and I could honestly say the pizza was disgusting. I bought the pizza for a total of 4 people and not one of us enjoyed it. I threw the entire pizza away. What a waste, will not be coming back.
__label__5	"Doug & the Pinch A Penny crew have been so helpful with a stain situation and overall care of our pool. Thank you for also being so sweet to my sheltie ""Kirby!"""
__label__5	I ate at Seasons 53 this past weekend and had the New York Strip steak cooked medium rare. These guys are not a steakhouse, so how did they manage to outdo several pricey steak chains nearby? I can honestly say it was one of the best steaks I have ever eaten; beautifully charred on the outside and a perfect medium rare inside. The service was great, I loved the wine the server suggested, but my gosh, that steak!
__label__5	Are you gluten intolerant and out on the bourbon/canal area at night?  Eat here!  I am only in town for two nights but had late night dinner here both nights because it was so amazing the first night.  I got a chicken souvlaki platter which has hummus, tatziki, salad, yellow rice, and chicken.  I got it without the pita.  They also have delicious alcohol free slush!
__label__2	Been here 3-4 times. They always run out of food, the tap cocktails are weak and the bar stools are ridiculously uncomfortable. Meh.
__label__5	"This place is the real deal of coffee!

I ordered the vanilla sweet cream cold brew (size small) and am SO GLAD I DID!! The staff here is true to customer service and very friendly to answer any questions you might have. 

The pricing is a little steep, however I believe this was a great treat and would return again!

PSA: they do punch cards as well."
__label__4	I like that Hobby Lobby has a great selection of home decor items.  I feel like their sewing and crafting departments could be enhanced like that of other craft and hobby stores.  Their selection has something for everything.  But if you need something very specific or you want a variety of fabrics, you will need to head over to their competitors.
__label__5	Great place for some amazing Pizza,  subs and pasta!!  Great people and get ready for an unbelievable food coma!!
__label__1	If you want. A sandwich with cheese and lettuce and skimpy ass meat that you can't taste and a sandwich that takes over 10 minutes to make let the meth head in the afternoon make your sandwich. Can't believe this woman even got hired. Subway you are losing your reputation hiring drug addicts. Never gonna come back to this location
__label__1	Don't bother unless you don't mind a rude hostess. She chewed (like a cow) as she leaned  and  arrogantly informed  us of a long wait. (Ms. T  has a  VERY small dinning area) She could soo... care less!  What fool gave her this  job,. I'll assume the fool is/was   a family member.  Later I was informed we didn't miss much anyway.
__label__5	Delicious pasta and good size portions. Reasonably priced as well. Will definitely be going back.
__label__1	Was there over the weekend, and was ignored by the waitstaff for 10 minutes, even as they took orders from two tables that came in after.  I finally asked a man with a white dress shirt and white hair if we could be served as he was wiping down a table if we could be served and we'd been waiting awhile.  He proceeded to tell us we were free to have breakfast elsewhere. So we left, telling him I'd been a customer there for over 10 years.  Won't be back.  Never saw this guy before, maybe it's new owners...
__label__5	All I can say is WOW!! I found this little gem on Monday and have finally found my place to eat breakfast and lunch! My server Allison was incredible from start to finish. She was fast, friendly and efficient and the food was out of this world. The hustle and bustle of this mom and pop cafe is amazing. I cant wait to go back!!!
__label__5	Our server Eduardo was awesome! Shortly after we sat down he brought over waters for the table (i never saw the bottom of my glass) and a fruit plate for the kiddos. You must get the guacamole! We also ordered Costillas al Piquin (dynamite) and a fish dish that I can't recall but it was delicious. Overall our experience was even better than when we had gone without the kids. The Sunday evening service was exemplary. Thanks!
__label__5	My friends and I were on vacation in New Orleans and stumbled upon Gnome. We almost didn't walk in because we were looking for the French Market. I'm so glad we did! They had such a fantastic selection of funky/unique jewelry for such an amazing price. I'm used to shopping in NYC and the people at Gnome could easily get triple the price for the pieces I got there. I couldn't believe it. My only regret is not purchasing more things!!
__label__1	The absolute worst dining experience I've ever had of any kind. The most repulsive kind of coffee shop. All pretension, no substance, the absolute worst service one could ever imagine.
__label__5	We were in the mood for great live jazz in a friendly, cozy setting and boy did we luck out!! We were lured in by the sounds of New Orleans jazz and we got front seats during Fritzel's 52nd Anniversary party. They welcomed us in like family. The family had made authentic, yummy Greek eats and just for this one night invited the patrons to partake in the celebration! A night that my friend and I will never ever forget. Go in- you'll make memories of fantastic jazz among friends
__label__3	I got a rock tumbler for my birthday and now will be looking for rocks to purchase at a reasonble price and the reviews are mixed on this place,but I will definately give it a try and see what happens...
__label__5	The tattoo artist (Sean) was really professional and patient. I really enjoyed my experience. It was a small tattoo, quickly and expertly done. I have 3 tats from 3 different artists. I'm in love with Sean's style and friendly professionalism. I'll definitely being going back to him for my next one!
__label__3	I've never been amazed/satisfied by the food or the cupcakes. Returned several times to give them another chance. Sadly the best location was Carpintería but it is no longer open.
__label__5	Aaron and his team are amazing. They are professional, polite and quick. I've used then multiple times, some jobs were very small and some were large, and I couldn't ask for better customer service. Just an overall  great experience.
__label__4	Loved this place.  The food was nothing but quality.  Generous portions and our waiter Frank had a wonderful personality! I will definitely return.
__label__5	AMAZING FOOD & SERVICE! Ask for Jessie and tell him Miss Michael sent you! The owner IS from the Tuscan area of Italy and has her wines, cheeses and lot of other foods shipped in from Italy constantly! Home made tiramisu is AWESOME!!! I ate there frequently when I lived in New Orleans just 4 blocks away. I truly miss it!
__label__5	In town for Spring Break & stopped in. Fabulous food.  Fabulous atmosphere.  Joey our server was awesome. Definitely my new go to place when I am in town.
__label__3	I have been to this venue for several shows in the past.  Capital Theater is well done and would be a great boutique venue if it weren't for the lack of air conditioning and the sardine seating.  The upper mezzanine seating is the worst.
__label__5	Very nice hotel!!!!  Walking distance from lots of places.  Nice bar and restaurant Finch.  Excellent roof top pool, hot tub, and bar for guests only.  You cannot go wrong with a Kimpton.
__label__1	I ordered Chickin Biryani and it was pretty much a non-vegetarian version of Bisibillen bat. I could have mixed white rice and chicken curry myself. Having said that, I am yet to find a restaurant that serves real dum biryani.
__label__5	I treated myself to a hot rock massage in the small cave and loved everything about it.  From the moment I took off my shoes in the waiting room, and dug my toes into the loose salt on the floor, I began to relax.  Moving into the small cave was unlike anything I have ever experienced; most massage rooms are designed to be relaxing, but the ambiance of the cave was breathtaking!  Walter was my massage therapist and highly recommend him!  He was gentle and soothing, and made sure my comfort was his priority.  Be warned, this is not a cheap experience, but one that is worth every penny!
__label__1	Nice spot for a drink. Terrible food. Awful plates. Not even the charcuterie board, something that easy. Nice environment for a personal interaction though.
__label__3	Fun but not really anything special. Feels like college. Do with that what you will. Drinks were strong and there was no cover when I went so that was nice! I don't really see myself going back though unless I'm with others who are.
__label__1	"This is not at all how it appears on the pictures. It looks more like a sleazy hooker hotel. The rooms smell like cigarettes. The beds are small. The carpet was dirty. The whole room was stinky. Does not look like the other red roof inns I have been too. This is more for ""hookup"" motel."
__label__3	"This airport has a lack of healthy and vegetarian food options beyond security, which is pretty annoying. I checked multiple restaurants for breakfast and there wasn't much available. I thought I'd have success at Shapiros but the girl working informed me they were no longer serving breakfast at 10:20am, even though the sign said ""serving breakfast until 10:30am."""
__label__3	Food was just ok. I had fajita enchiladas.  I have definitely had better mexican food.  Chips and Salsa were good.  The portions, atmosphere and service were all good. The place was busy and clean. We have friends that rave about  their food so we will give it another chance and order something different next time.
__label__4	good in 'nd out spot for a hoagie, i usually never know what to get unlike most other people that comes in, so take a minute to order and they are pretty nice about it. not much room to stand when is busy and lots of people waiting around.
__label__5	We love House of Gyros. My husband and I always get the gyro salad. The gyro meat has a great flavor. The sauces are super tasty.  The portion sizes are significant. I generally eat half my gyro salad and have the rest for lunch the following day. The team is amazing, helpful, and terrific every time we come in.
__label__5	I went to the Safelite shop after contacting my insurance about my cracked windshield. From the shop manager to the installation technicians, I was kept informed about the work to be performed on my car. Everyone there were courteous, professional and informative. My car was repaired within an hour and I am pleased with to finished repair. I would not hesitate to call on them again or recommend them to friends. Thank you.
__label__5	Atlantis is one of the best casinos in Reno. They treat their customers properly and reward them accordingly for their level of patronage.
__label__1	"The food here is ok.
But the service will make you forget whether you enjoyed it or not.
I generally will forgive bad service for really good food, but this place only has part one of that equation worked out.
We politely mentioned to a manager that we weren't really thrilled with the hour we had waited for our food to arrive and he said that he would go talk to another manager about it (?), only to never return to our table.
One word review - NO."
__label__5	Sarah is great! Always friendly and professional! Great prices and friendly service :) I also love how much they give back to the community, this salon rocks!
__label__5	I was having issues with my Trek and wanted to get a repair estimate.  They quickly identified the issue, fixed it, and I was in and out in less than 10 minutes. Everyone who works at Ben's is so friendly and extremely knowledgeable. The bonus is they're super approachable for beginners. Love this place and highly recommend!
__label__5	LOVE the Anderson Orchard! We had a perfect day here. They have apples, pumpkins, fresh produce and much more. The food is dirt cheap. Get the biscuits and apple butter with an apple cider slushie. You won't regret it!  It's a fun time even if your without kiddos. We went on a little double date with family. Sat and enjoyed our apple goodies and listened to the Meek Sisters while sitting in the sun. We'll be back again next year!
__label__2	Applebee's has OK food and at a nice price. The waitress was friendly and helpful but the burger was to be desired. Avoid their burgers and go for the pasta
__label__5	Outstanding recently opened new local business. Everything is new and the place is spotless. Wonderful outdoor seating area with TV's or for socializing and people watching.  Awesome place to spend some quality time with your significant other or just friends hanging out for a few cold ones, playing pool or darts, or just watching sports.  Staff is awesome and atmosphere is fantastic.  Great variety of on tap brews and wide selection of other brands.  If you don't have a great time here, then you're pretty hard to please.  Give this place a chance, check it out, you will not be sorry.
__label__1	$2.50 for ice?! (unadvertised) Ya, AVOID this place like the plague unless you like $10+ cocktails served with a side of attitude (courtesy of what I assume was a manager), who thought it good business to confront the table with no intentions of fixing the situation (so expect a showdown if you post something before leaving).  Really nice waitress and decent food; shame the management makes the whole establishment look bad.
__label__3	I used to really like the goods from here, but the past 2 times I've been disappointed. I got the chocolate chip cookie, and it was somehow flavorless and overly sweet at the same time.
__label__5	Our family has been getting special occasion cakes from Cakes Plus for the last 20 years, and now, my wedding cake. Always the best taste and quality, I won't consider anywhere else.
__label__1	Dave in the Paint Department is horrible. I'm standing right in front of him and acts as if I'm invisible. Then when I do ask for help he gives me an attitude like I did something wrong. Terrible customer service. No shock here. HD lives up to their reputation of providing horrible customer service. Another reason why I'd rather shop elsewhere.
__label__3	We use to eat here a lot with company.  For some reason we got out of the habit so went back today for lunch.  I have to agree with the other reviewers - something has changed.  The menu is smaller ( which isn't always a bad thing if the items are great).   My daughter had pulled pork and it was cold and dry.   I had fish tacos and the fish was fishy and also very dry.  Over cooked. Nothing special at all.  Fries are the frozen prepackaged type.  I don't anticipate returning with out of town guests.  Too many better choice around.
__label__5	Amalie is hands down one of the best arena's in the nation.  The staff is alway friendly. There really isn't a bad seat in the house especially for hockey but the same is true for concerts as well.
__label__1	They forgot a burger and the fries were cold. Went into the lobby to get the burger and tell them about the stale fries. They gave me my burger but didn't bother with the fries. Didn't seem like they cared the fries are gross. So we have 3 medium stale fries. Maybe we can use this as fertilizer  wait. McDonald's doesn't decompose. A few reviews mentioned the fries being cold and stale so it's not just me.
__label__5	Great service and even better food! The experience is new and exciting every time I go. Outdoor seating is perfect with a lot of shade and misters
__label__5	I LOVE Smashburger! I have never had a bad meal here. Everything is delicious. The service is really good. I keep coming back!
__label__1	Scary place.  Glad to have gotten out with my life and my wallet.
__label__1	terrible service！！I have never been to a bad restaurant like Lulu！we sit there for moren than 10 mins， nobody ask us anything to drink. really bad service！
__label__5	I started my braces in San Diego in February this year and had to move to Tampa in June. My husband and I visited a few orthodontist offices and we were very impressed by Abdoney Orthodontics. The place was modern and spacious, staff are nice and friendly. Most of all, Dr. McEntire was super great! He was bright, energetic, fun and professional. He made sure everything goes well whenever I visited him. I feel so lucky to find Abdoney Orthodontics and to meet Dr. McEntire as well as his staff who showed what care means.
__label__3	"First and foremost, the food really is amazing! We have come here many times because of the amazing tacos and variety of meats! We love $1.00 taco night. 

I am writing this review because I am tired of coming here time after time and being met with arrogant And rude employees. Loco pez has incredible food but I'm starting to wonder whether its worth dealing with the arrogant waitstaff. 

I love going places where you feel at home.  This place never conveys that!"
__label__2	The first 2 times I ate at Primi's were superb! I enjoyed the paninis. However a few weeks ago, they changed their menu. They no longer serve paninis for lunch and the price jacked up a little and the food taste diminished.
__label__5	"Apartments are decent in size , property is always kept clean and maintenance is friendly as hell , you can always see them driving around and ask them a question and 9/10 they will help you on the spot if they can. Love the fact that some units have garages attached to them. 

Having a car wash right on property is great as well as the recreational area such as the pool and gym for short highly recommend living here"
__label__5	Filled my DoorDash order even though it was almost an hour after they closed due to DoorDash taking too long. Great customer service!
__label__4	The great thing about this place is that it has a similar menu as many other places across the USA. The food is very good and the service is good as well. Good food at a great value, and I really like that!
__label__4	"Beer was alright, some cool varieties I hadn't seen before. The taproom was warm and open, which I loved. 

Nice staff.

A chill place to throw back a few pints with friends."
__label__5	Delicious, affordable and byob! Visit the restaurant if you can instead of getting take-out, the overall experience is way better.
__label__5	The absolute best chicken and catfish is served at this place!  Great cajun dishes!.  I eat here every time I come in town.  Great food, great prices, and an awesome staff.  Best restaurant  in Hendersonville!
__label__5	Better than cafe du monde GETTHE PRALINE FILLED BEIGNETS! You will not be sorry!?! We were the first customer of the day as a gift from our UBER driver. You HAVE to try these to believe them!
__label__5	We came on a Friday night. I had the Lamb Kahari and it was awesome! I will definitely come back.
__label__5	Came to visit from NYC.  Blindly pick this restaurant while walking in Chinatown.  Excellent food, definitely on point.   Canto to the canto taste.  Highly recommend!
__label__3	We came in very late (30mins till closing) and that may be our own fault but I find it kind of rude to be cleaning up before closing. Now, I'm talking putting stuff completely away and groaning when I order something they've already put away. The guy working the register seemed too bothered by us wanting to pay him...food was good just lacking service
__label__3	This was the only option we found for pizza after 9pm. Overall it was decent and got the job done. Flavor was average, price seemed fair. Chicken wings were good. No complaints should accommodate those who seek some after bar food.
__label__5	"Absolutely pleasantly surprised! This was my first time eating here! I've been eliminating beef and pork from my diet for 2 years now and the none meet food choices that have here were phenomenal ! I had the ginger carrot/coconut soup it was very delicious and then the eggless wrap oh my gosh that was very yummy 

The restaurant is nothing fancy but well appointed and fitting in my opinion. The food is simple but very good ! Super friendly staff that let me sample a few dishes upfront before I ordered since it was my first visit . I will certainly be back"
__label__5	"An Absolutely fucking delicious place! One of a kind! Great service and food! 10/10 
Recommend surf and turf, ceviche, calamari, and seafood bowl!"
__label__1	This morning Sunday jan9/2016 we had the worst experience there...old boiled potatoes so called roasted potatoes...burned bacon ..watery unsalted eggs, dry fried chicken...and horrendous cheap coffee..I complained and the waiter tried to convinced I was wrong! (I'M A REAL CHEF) I'm a latino...but honestly you cannot let a Mexican cook take care a kitchen of a very well known brand like monells...or a least train him better...!!!
__label__5	Awesome bbq with a ton of different choices on bbq sauce. Atmosphere is dive bar like with super friendly staff and great prices on drinks.
__label__3	KOI is showing its age. It wasn't as nice or as clean as the last time I visited. The table was a bit sticky. There was food scraps on the floor around the seating areas. Despite that, the staff was nice and we were seated quickly. We ordered shrimp and chicken. The cook was skilled, entertaining and the food was good. I'm mainly dinging them for not maintaining the restaurant over time and for a lack of cleanliness. If you are looking for affordable hibachi then this is a decent option. I hope they were just having an off night.
__label__5	"Feast offers a taste away from the mundane. The ever changing menu every month provides the diners exciting new things to sample. The inventive  product of the chefs always leaves me with a contented palate and a longing to come back for more. If you are not adventurous with your food choices this is not for you. If your a foodie like me, this place will never disappoint and always remain dynamic in their creations.
The wine selections are average prices and carefully selected to satisfy the wine lover in anyone."
__label__4	Staff are friendly and helpful. Foods are tasty, many choices, reasonable price. But Tom Yum can be make it better (I think). Recommend to make a reservation in advance due to limited tables. Parking can be easy to find on the street. Definitely will come back again.
__label__4	"Food: 5 stars
Service: 2 stars (they make it seem like you insulted their mother if you ask for more water, or a napkin etc) 
Wait time: 4 stars (usually a line, but moves quickly)
Good place to take a date if you don't know if you tryna date date or just get it in under $30 for two"
__label__5	I am very happy to have this place in the neighborhood.  Real Italian food. Seafood is always fresh. And the calamari is wonderful.  Eggplant parm just melts in your mouth.    It doesn't look like much, but this family owned place is always friendly. And if you pay attention,  the kitchen staff speaks to each other in Italian
__label__1	Never will return.  The owner/manager was completely rude.  The place is so tight there was no room to move my seat back.  Felt rushed.  The food itself wasn't something to brag about.  Much better Italian byos in town.
__label__5	This place is AMAZING! Incredible massage and service, for a great price. I will be going back here again and again!
__label__4	This is a small cafe that is open for breakfast and lunch. Service is fairly quick.  The. Real fast entrees are pretty standard. They typically have a daily soup, quiche and omelette. My favorite item is the chopped salad. It is filled with chicken, bacon and avocado and the champagne vinaigrette really adds to the salad. If you want bread though you have to ask for it. They have a coffee bar so that you can get your own.
__label__3	Wasn't overly impressed by this spot. Had never heard of it before but it was packed, kind of feels like a small town diner. It's very loud and tables are super close together. The service was lack luster and I had to ask for a second glass of water, never got that second cup of coffee I asked for. The food was pretty good however my biscuit was a bit hard. I don't think I'll be coming back to this spot. Also you should probably refrain from having fresh lilies in a restaurant. I'm going to vomit.
__label__2	Nice concept but needs to be completed before they can support the current pricing structure.  There are only two treehouse included in the general admission. All other activities are add on charges .  Such as archery , bungee jumping,  tree climbing, zip lining etc... Would be a higher star rating if admission prices more closely reflect what is included in general admission.
__label__5	I had never eaten at jersey Mike's. I was always a subway girl. But WOW! I was definitely missing out. Everything tasted much more fresh. The staff has always been friendly as ive been so frequently now i might be a regular now. I would recommend checking them out.
__label__5	The chips and salsa are excellent, the tacos were delicious, and even with a beer I still paid less than 10 dollars.  It's so authentic, there's a man playing Spanish songs on guitar at the bar.
__label__5	Fun and friendly place. This was our first time at a place like this. Ordered appetizers and drinks. Noah or waiter was fast and friendly. Recommend this for good family entertainment.
__label__5	"I am not a huge pharmacy shopper and infrequent yelp reviewer. I recently have been trying to get Phenobarbital for my pet as prices are increasing. CVS has always been the pharmacist's pharmacy for its focus on Health.  The pharmacy manger Priten Patel went out of his way to find the lowest price and he contacted me for the discount. If you are in the Camden County area and looking for an independent pharmacy ""feel"" with a chain discount price and the easy window check out. Check CVS soon."
__label__2	I have been frequenting The Living Room for years. They have always had an extensive menu and the food was amazing. I visited today and was told that they have a new chef and the menu has changed. The service, drinks, and environment were great. The food was lackluster at best. The empanadas were flavorless with a sauce that was gelatinous, the Brussels sprouts were burnt with little sauce, and the meatballs were dry. The quality of food seems to have gone down hill. I will try once more.
__label__1	We thought this was one of those hidden gems that would be true New Orleans fare, but it was very disappointing. The sweet tea was canned not brewed, the lettuce in my husband's salad was bad, and they were out of standard things on the menu (gumbo, creamed spinach, etc.) The food was marginal and overpriced.
__label__4	"This is a beer lover's bar. Great selection that is constantly on the move with news things coming in. They also have the best wings for miles and miles. 

My major complaint is that they need some place online to announce their beer list and events. I want to give them my money I just need to know the best times!"
__label__5	My beloved 19 year old cat developed hyperthyroidism. Unfortunately, he is also not great at taking oral medications. Companion Pet Hospital suggested a transdermal alternative. Art of Medicine has been patient and thorough with their explanation of dosages. They were very kind, understanding, and worked with me in reformulating the medication to the volume I thought would work best for my cat.
__label__5	Both of their Locations are phenomenal. The coffee and food selections are all so good. I have Lyme disease, so I really appreciate the staff for taking their time to help answer questions about certain ingredients so that I can find a dish that I won't react negatively to. Walden''s is always a great place to get together for breakfast.
__label__4	"The service is good and they have Good Mexico food. I tried the al pastor (marinated pork) torta and it was tasty. A following day I tried the burrito and it was good as well. I like that they serve tortilla chips with the meal. I found the salsa was good also - just enough spiciness and not overwhelming. 
I'll be returning."
__label__4	Ordered here the other day with DoorDash. My aunt got a peppers and egg sandwich with potato bombs and I got a blackened chicken Caesar salad and we got the pepperoni bread to try. Everything was awesome! My aunt enjoyed her sandwich and those potato bombs so much she told me dad all about it! The pepperoni bread was amazing. The marinara sauce on the side was delicious so I'm excited to try their other Italian specialties. Salad was great! Definitely ordering again!
__label__2	I just came from having lunch today.  Tried the daily lunch special, the chicken fried steak and creamed potatoes.  Sadly the best of my lunch was the salad.  The canned gravy was not tasty like it was poured directly from the can.  Instant potatoes. Try adding a few fresh boiled potatoes to the instant potatoes, that should help.  I have been here before but I cannot return after such a dissatisfied visit today.
__label__5	Best sushi in Philadelphia! We went for lunch on a weekday and were able to get seated in the tiny restaurant. We ordered the tuna dumplings, which were delicious as expected. We also did the 3 roll special- I actually recommend against doing this. These rolls were nothing special. The specialty rolls are where Vic differentiates itself. Sansom was my favorite!
__label__5	"The Lucky Beaver is a favorite of mine for several reasons, but it's predominately the staff and burgers that keep me coming back! Chelsy, Aaron, and Gary are all amazing and take amazing care of myself and my friends whenever we're in!

If you ever go in, try the Gold Rush burger! It's AMAZING!"
__label__1	Be sure to never go here to get a nail repaired if you got a manicure at a different nail salon. They won't service you, even if you clearly are willing to pay. They only want service for a full set or manicure - greedy greedy greedy. I'll never go back to another Nail Bar again. And PS - last time I did get a dip manicure here, I left with 8 out of 10 fingers bleeding, cut, and burned from the drill. BEWARE!
__label__1	"I recently reserved to midsize SUVs was told by the website it will be a Toyota RAV4 or similar when I arrived we received two Jeep renegades, which have substantially smaller trunk space this was an issue. They stated that they didn't have any Toyota RAV4 similar this is what they had . Should have a better inventory

As you can see enterprise contacted me to fix issue . I sent them the info they wanted and still week and a half later no response from them. Talk about dropping the ball."
__label__5	Excellent shop. The service is great, all employees are knowledgeable, and the selection is good.  For those interested, they usually have tastings on Thursday evenings.
__label__5	We took this ride for our seven-year-old son, but our cranky (tween) ended up having just as much of a blast. I highly recommend this for a family activity. The sunset ride was phenomenal.
__label__5	Our service call was returned within minutes.  Roman arrived approximately 40 minutes later and resolved our air conditioner issue very quickly and professionally.  We have found our new heating and air conditioning service company.  A+++
__label__4	I had a good experience and customer service were great. My room at 23 floor was beautiful.
__label__1	The one star is for the ambiance.  Went to get some pizza and salad but they ran out of salads because of a catering order earlier in the day.  The piss poor management of food supplies is why this place can not get any higher than a star.  The owner should be ashamed of how poorly they have selected management. I have worked in the food industry and never saw such a nonchalant approach to being out of all salads which make up a third of the menu.  Server even joked how she should have ordered a salad earlier before they ran out.
__label__5	I had chicken enchiladas with rice and beans.  It was excellent.   Not that fond of rice but this was so good I wanted some more.  Food tasted fresh and clean and am sorry I don't live nearby so that I could come here again.
__label__5	Second time at Toups and was as great as the first!  I'm a carnivore at heart and can't get enough of this place.  The absolute best pork cracklins and rillons (tastes like candied pork) in the city.  Double cut pork chops, dirty rice, grilled quail, deviled eggs, deliciousness.  And they have Debbie does Doberge!  We live in the quarter and are lazy about taxiing to other neighborhoods but Toups Meatery is worth the short cab ride.
__label__2	We looks up this restaurant on Yelp and we were convinced by the very positive reviews it had. We ordered the ribs with fries and coleslaw. The ribs were pretty disappointing. They were very dry and overcooked. The fries were pretty tasteless. The coleslaw was ok. Overall not more than 2 stars for us.
__label__5	Delicious pho and great customer service! I have only tried the pho so I don't know how anything else is, but I really like the pho. I was glad to find a good place so close to home.
__label__5	The food is excellent! The salad was unbelievable. Nuts and cranberries and the dressing was so yummy. The rolls were excellent. I ordered 2 filets with crabmeat and shrimp on top. It was the best meal I have had in awhile. The meat melted in my mouth. Customer service was excellent. Virgil, our waiter, was outstanding. A little pricey but the quality of the food makes it a good value. I would go back in a heartbeat. I highly recommend this small quaint restaurant.
__label__1	Got what we ordered after repeating it 3+ times at the drive-thru. I blamed the mic until i got to the horrible service at the window. Paid for the meal with no receipt given, stuff was handed out the window and he didnt stick around to ask questions or say anything. Didnt  get one of the 4 sandwiches ordered, no straws, and no questions to be seen as far as sauces. He'll stay in the fast food business for a while Im sure with that work ethic.
__label__3	I got my eyes checked and purchased contact lenses here. I found the quality of service to be so-so. During a 5-min eye test that I was left to do, the doctor chitchatted with a friend in the same room which was very distracting. Getting my bills afterwards over the phone (since I don't live in Philly) was not too smooth of an experience either. Granted that they were in the middle of moving locations when I got my eyes tested which contributed to some of the chaos, but overall I think it could have been a much better experience.
__label__5	I had the day off and decided to stop in for a massage very reasonable price place was very clean and very friendly and I did a girl's excellent job working on me I really appreciate the effort they put into my massage
__label__1	The lady doing my pedicure was very unprofessional and made fun of my toes. She also cut my cuticle and was very rude. I would not recommend going to this place.
__label__4	Great food, reasonably priced.  Friendly service and nice atmosphere for quick lunch.  It's kind of loud inside.  I had the pita with chicken and veggies with half Tzatziki sauce and half Sriracha ranch for a kick of spice.
__label__1	"Avoid this place. 

I really don't understand the 5 star ratings. Are they written by owners and friends? 

The only good thing about this place was the lack of lines.  

But that is most likely because the product is poor. We tried two bowls here - the power Acai and the Aloha. both were underwhelming and overpriced!

I'm all for bringing healthy choices to Nashville. Just not at the expense of flavor. Come on!"
__label__1	I have beeen waiting for my food for an hour now, and have been staring at it waiting to be served for 20 minutes. This is not acceptable. The food that had been given to my peers has been served cold, and the waiting staff has been extremely inattentive. Please fix this!
__label__5	I love it here. Went last year in the summer and had a blast. Good food and drinks. Plan on going here again this spring
__label__3	Good food but $12.50 for a Jack Daniels? Are you kidding me? Way overpriced for just because reasons.  No excuse for that.
__label__1	"Where do I start? We entered building and cleaning lady yelled ""what?"" at us when we said politely ""excuse me, can you point us in the direction of the arcade?"". Then we smelled the strongest smell of smoke ever in the arcade area. I know it's part of a casino, but it was a disgusting and heavy smoke smell that we didn't want kids inhaling so we left. Place made us all feel like we needed an immediate shower."
__label__5	Upgrading to 5 stars after most recent visit. I held back on the 5th star because of delays/confusion getting the food. They solved this problem. After ordering we went up to the deck. When the food was ready we could clearly hear our name over the PA system. Small issue but they fixed it. Bravo!!!
__label__1	"Horrible customer service.

Needs to learn to be professional
Emails should be replied within reasonable time.
I personally believe a good business should provide excellent service. Please have a reliable phone number for customers to call."
__label__1	I know people love this place but I did not. My friend, trying to be healthy, ordered and egg white omelette with spinach and some other vegetables. OMG it was suffocated in butter. Also ordered the smoked salmon the presentation was just piled on a plate.  Not a big fan may give this place one more chance.
__label__5	I always love coming here with my family of 5! The staff is very friendly and accommodating. The food is always amazing and never disappoints. Great beers, soups and healthy low calorie options.
__label__5	Absolutely fantastic steak! Cooked medium rare to perfection! Excellent service as well
__label__1	Went there because they had a kids menu.  Lunch was ok, waitress was friendly, had to change my kids diaper and there was no changing table in the restroom.  I asked the waitress if there was a place to change a diaper and she went and asked the manager who told me to go to the gas station down the street.  I will not be returning.  You would think that a place that has a kids menu, high chairs, and booster seats appears to be kid-friendly but to bring my child to a gas station to change a diaper is ridiculous.  Parents beware
__label__5	Always helpful and diligent. I feel safe and don't feel like they want to take advantage of me because I'm a woman
__label__5	Lovely dark brick and candles galore, it feels intimate. Curtis the bartender whipped up the tastiest Moscow Mule I have ever had in a signature copper cup. Their pork sliders & mac are scrumptious. One of the best places to grab a drink downtown.
__label__4	Another regular lunch destination for me, Sassafras throws together some filling and delicious hoagies. First time I went in Sassafras all I could do was look around and say to my self, well if this isn't a prefect bodega I don't know what is. Typically great selection in food for everyone, Boars head meats in the deal, vegan and vegetarian sandwiches in the coolers. Organic and junk food from floor to ceiling.
__label__2	I want to like this place because of location.  But the service is super slow - every time I check in or out it's a production - the staff just can't get into the computer or can't hear my name or can't spell it right. They always seem confused. We were happy with the actual cleaning of our clothes and that they keep a credit card on file and provide discount through their VIP Program, but it's just too frustrating to do business there.
__label__5	Literally one of the best Cheese steaks that left an impression on me while I was living the in Philly.
__label__3	I was in town and tried the pho. It was ok. The place was dirty. The guy who work there was in a beater shirt and flip flops. The food overall was bland. I wouldn't recommend.
__label__2	Seafood Bucatini was beyond salty. Got a second order of the bucatini and was just as salty. Sorry after second try I left.
__label__5	"I do not know why there are negative comments about this place. Sarah Laser Center was one of the most wonderful experience of my life. The receptionist and the technician was very friendly and accommodating. I had the 6 laser hair treatments for my legs and Jenny the technician did an amazing job. Not only did she do a wonderful job but the treatments were a success. I even did treatments for my underarms and it also turned out to be a success.

I would highly recommended Sarah Laser Center to everyone. This Laser Center is one of the best and professional I have ever seen."
__label__3	I've only been here a few times, but no complaints with the service. The people here are very friendly. The problem is the set up. Such a strange drive through to get to the ATM.
__label__5	Been coming to this location for years. And the food is usually good except maybe a few occasions. But I'm guessing it was someone different cooking. Whatever the case I'm usually satisfied. I always get my favorite which is the orange chicken dinner.
__label__5	Service was moving kinda slow and forgetful but other than that we waited for our table for about 20 mins but once we got our food I fell in love with this wonderfully decorated restaurant. This is a must when you're in Nashville. Most of the art you will see in the restursnt are up for sale so if you're interested in that then this is also the place for you!
__label__1	The timing was wrong for when we had to pick up our takeout. The pancakes weren't fluffy , my bacon was overcooked, the eggs were a little watery and barely had flavor and the French toast was dry. I wouldn't order from this location again for a while.
__label__4	Had lunch here the other day and it was delicious! You get a lot of food for a great price so come here hungry. I gave it 4 stars because the seating is a bit cramped and I felt like other diners were on top of me while I was trying to eat.
__label__4	This place has nice decor, pretty good food, decent value and service. Nothing spectacular, but a pretty solid sushi restaurant.
__label__5	"Toro tartar plus Tuna Pizza plus $75 chef sushi platter fed 2 of us with ease (and leftovers).  Fish of many varieties - and all were top quality and uber-fresh.

We still caved and split the chocolate pot de creme.

Topped mine off with a glass of the Veuve and Mama was veddy veddy happy.

Our server, Eric, was workin' it and everything was 5 star all the way!"
__label__4	"Located on Bourbon st. Ordered the...
Boiled crawfish - 1 pound for $14 (Market Price)
Jambalaya - $7
Gumbo - $6

The boiled crawfish came with a corn on a cob, sausage, and potatoes. This dish was pretty good, it had a nice spicy season to it.

The gumbo was pretty decent, and was served with chicken and sausage.

The jambalaya with chicken and sausage was a little too salty with little spice or flavor you would expect from a jambalaya."
__label__3	As soon as I walked in they checked our IDs which I understand but the workers there were not friendly and very rude. I felt unwelcomed and stared at the whole time. But the good thing is The store is very well organized and clean. Good variety, they just need to hire people that are friendly and enjoy being there. Melanie is the one that attended me :/
__label__5	"I went here for the first time today.

The pizza is delicious.  Crispy crust that isn't too thin or thick.  Flavorful sauce and it's cheesy.  Friendly staff with quick service.

And who doesn't like pizza and beer?  This place is awesome."
__label__5	"I've been wanting a piercing for sometime now but was leery about a tattoo shop, since we had just moved to Houston. 
While on a weekend getaway to NOLA we walked by Purity several times.  It was very inviting, clean, professional looking. 
I'm so glad on our last day I made the decision to finally get pierced.  Monique was wonderful!  Relaxing, knowledgeable, professional.  
I can't think there is anything they can do better! 
Thank you!"
__label__3	I enjoy the food at first watch but the service is very slow. The hermitage location took so long and my server talked to me once to take my order. I had to request my ticket and decided the leftovers weren't seconds worthy. The food came out cool. Not impressed this time.
__label__4	Interesting menu and unique exterior with pool & hot tub next to the outdoor patio dining area. Recently had the NY Strip Steak Sandwich at lunch... it was big, perfectly cooked and delicious!
__label__5	Really unique flavors for a vegetarian restaurant! Great food really trumps any problems w ambiance.
__label__5	Responded in a timely fashion. Came and picked up ride on mower for a small fee. Not only checked for the belt that I needed replaced but did a complete complete looker and maintenance of my mower. Spark plug, oil, transmission, blades, tire repair! I'm so impressed! Turn around time from pick up to repair was reasonable. My husband is excited about using it this season. Will definitely use Brendan's Repair again!
__label__1	"Stingy with the meat on the burritos and not well cooked. This has now happened to me the past three times I've gone. 
Definitely not going here anyone."
__label__1	Staff is unfriendly, breakfast sandwich was not only cold but incorrect. With no one in line it took 10 minutes to get my food corrected and he handed me the same sandwich back.... A little colder and more handled. Way to go! I should've picked something up from the gas station across the street.
__label__5	"YUM YUM YUM!!!

I found my Holy Grail for Thai food! This place is delicious! 

Pad Thai and Red Curry is a must try. I always get then Thai Tea as well. 

All in all this place is delicious and affordable. Sooooo happy I found this place!"
__label__5	Katie is by far the best in the area! She's so funny and is so honest. I love how she really pays attention to detail and her work is so impressive! I came in with really bad nails from Oceans...and I was telling her how they overcharged me. She consistently reminded me that good nails take time. And she delivered! I'm so happy with this place. I always go elsewhere to see what's in Reno but I always keep coming back her. Julie is sweet too! I honestly can say that this is my nail spa, after trying 6 different places in Reno
__label__1	Slowest service in the world,15 min to get drinks. Tried to get a beer and longer to try and leave.  30 min sitting here,I feel trapped!
__label__5	We recently attended Mardi Gras in 2019. We ate in many different restaurants but mothers resturant was the very best out of all the food we ate. Everything was tasty and absolutely amazing to me. The roast beef, ham, grits, collard greens, green beans and ham, and rice with red beans. I can't wait to eat there again when I am in New Orleans again.
__label__3	For a five stars hotel, it is disappointing. Reception is not worthy of such hotel. Only one attendant for multiple clients and the concierge is never there. Room in building 9 are noisy. It is enough for your neighbor to flash the toilet you think it is happening in your room
__label__5	Love it here!! Moved back because I loved the staff & floorplans so much. Affordable & close to Carmel & downtown plus a sweet office staff, I love it here. Plus, look at my apartment (ignore some of the moving mess)
__label__1	I called to just get information about a Pilot, just information, not to test drive or anything by wanted to see all my options over the phone so no hassle having to go in. Shelia gives car dealership the bad name they have. No one likes to car shop bc of this exact reason. HARASSMENT. See pictures. I have blocked her number and email but am able to see if she leaves a message. The amount of calling is completely unacceptable. She told me in the beginning how they were different and don't irritate people, well, she lied.
__label__4	Great spot in the French Quarter. Locals had recommended it to us for their authentic po'boys. They were right! Excellent shrimp po'boys. Expensive, but what do you expect in the heart of the touristy city.
__label__4	"I stop by to grab pizza when I don't have time to cook dinner or when the kids just want something simple to eat.  When it's not busy, pizzas are ready, but good luck when it's busy.  Eeek!  But I've found a solution to that problem - there's an app for that!  :)  I now use the app to place my order ahead of time so that the pizza will be ready when I get here.  It works like a charm and certainly solves the ""it's a x minute wait"" issue!"
__label__5	"Loads of  gear with wide price ranges, decent selection of knives, some actual military surplus, friendly staff.
All in all, as noted in some reviews below, good shop for camping/hiking needs, but also if you are after some simple utilitarian clothes/boots.
Also, some really nice cast iron cookware."
__label__4	good food. they ran out of breakfast potatoes. a brunch place that runs out of breakfast potatoes? we'll they found more somehow - appreciated the effort. dog friendly on the patio. they even give them a biscuit!
__label__2	Friendly staff, terrible haircut.  I may be the exception to the rule, but I got a really bad haircut at this place. The guy disregarded what I wanted when I have had the same haircut for years.   But that was not even the problem.  It's a bad haircut, periodl
__label__1	can NEVER get anything right. they just slap everything right onto the hamburger. poor service in person and drive thru.
__label__1	"The window installation was wonderful and went smoothly, but working with the company Power was horrible. Project management was horrible. There was no communication at all. When I called with questions, they never responded. 
After installation, they said they set up the inspection, but they never showed. When I called many times to follow up, no response. I called and left countless voicemails to see what to do and they never answered my calls. We are now 3 months after installation with still no inspection.
They installed and never talked again.
USE A DIFFERENT COMPANY."
__label__5	Such a cute little, local BYOB place. Very inviting and one of my favorite Italian joints. The owner is friendly and enjoys talking to the guest. The food is amazing. I suggest the lobster ravioli and the mussles!! Amazing little joint.
__label__5	Tremendous service from everyone at this location from the dancers to the waitress to the bouncers even. Ended up spending a full afternoon here and it was a great time. Kudos to the whole crew! One warning: the drinks are very stiff and if you're not careful you'll end up staying all day enjoying the ambiance like I did. Much lighter on the wallet today but no regrets.
__label__5	The burgers are really good. The service is quick, the price is good. The quantity is insane. Huge portions & good quality food. My only dilemma was the burger toppings- some were fresh some looked old, like they mixed the new lettuce and tomato into the old? Otherwise really good food definitely would recommend.
__label__5	Great meal, service, and atmosphere.  Was pleasently surprised to find d this hidden gem off of  Plumb Lane.  Had dinner reservations at another Resturant and went earlIer to get a drink before our reservation.  Somebody at the bar recommendedd going there for a drink. Was really impressed and made a dinner reservation the following week.  Highly recommended.
__label__4	Free wifi. Very fast TSA checkpoint. Unbelievably kind people. My favorite airport for their quick speed and kindness. TSA w/ a personality!
__label__4	We stumbled upon this  place yesterday before going to the Rays game. It was delicious!! We split the brussel sprouts, raw oysters, Kilpatrick Oysters, Buffalo Shrimp, and Buffalo Oysters. I highly recommend the Buffalo Oysters. They were amazing. The decor inside was pretty cool too. I love the beach/boat paintings. We will definitely be back!!!
__label__5	When there's an antique store next to the first one that's a sign. Great staff willing to help and answer any questions. Plenty of Christmas decorations and we left with a few unique
__label__1	The service was good and the staff are attentive. The food is disappointing. The fish of the day was dry and tasteless. It was supposedly caught that day - it could not have been. The burgers we over cooked and served on a dry onion bun. The fries had grated cheese. Not a good experience.
__label__5	This place is the real deal. The menu is limited and simple but they are putting love into the food here. I ordered the Steak Bowl with Jollof rice and plantains. The steak was cooked just right and well seasoned. The Jollof rice was so flavorful and cooked perfectly. The staff here are also really friendly and hospitable. I'll definitely be going back ASAP!
__label__5	I can not rave more about chewys the are absolutely AMAZING! They were a big hit at my wedding last night! hors d'oeuvres  to dinner! the food was delish i wish i ate more but being the bride it was hard. the fried mac and cheese balls omg if i could have them now! charlie went above and beyond for us! if tounare looking for a food truck to rent he is ur guy.. i would do 10 stars if i could
__label__1	Anybody who's from New Orleans knows what a shrimp poboy should look and taste like. This is not it. I stopped by for lunch today to pick up a fried shrimp poboy to go. First of all it had 6 shrimps in it. That's it!! Mostly bread and lettuce. Secondly it was expensive! I paid $14.15 for a loaf of bread and six shrimp. Third, I will never return.
__label__2	I think that success has taken these guys to a level of arrogance that should not be accepted. We know good Mexican, the other one located at 54 and 75 is where they came from. Over the last year the service and food quality has dropped significantly, it is ashame.
__label__4	I rented a bike here twice during my stay and had a great experience both times.  The employees are very friendly and proficient  and take the time to set you up with the right bike.  A helmet and lock is included with the $20/day rental fee so you are good to go!
__label__2	"Terrible service waitress we only saw twice , food average, very dirty restaurant 
18$ for a salad do not recommend so many better choices in the quarter"
__label__3	This restaurant received three stars because the food is good.  The service is terrible.  Our waitress took forever to get us drinks, forgot our 2nd round entirely, served us the wrong dinners, and had major attitude when I asked for more water.  She was clearly not handling her stress of multiple tables well, and was literally deep sighing her frustration while taking our order.  It was pretty ridiculous.  Go for the food if you do not care about service.  Rudeness was way more disturbing that the mistakes.
__label__1	"Don't buy anything from this company. Customer service sucks. They are quick to take your money, but wont answer the phone if there are problems at all. Really? All voice mail boxes full & 1 number for all stores. I think the news media needs to be alerted!!! The people in this company don't care about you once they get their money.
I know the next time I shop at any store, I will be sure to read the reviews first."
__label__2	Their food is great and service is well but this valet service, this is ridiculous. Not only is it borderline illegal because it's on a one lane public street, but it blocks traffic! Meanwhile the valet drivers are laughing at people stuck in their traffic mess. The management needs to step up their game and learn to move their valet service next to their parking garage, where it won't make a mess.
__label__5	This company was amazing to work with! We were unsure on the design so Louis was very helpful in providing us ideas to come up with a final decision. Due to rain delays, the project took a bit longer but Natural Springs was great at keeping us in the loop on the next steps and what was occurring with the project. They have also been very responsive on small corrections we noticed once we started using the pool post completion. We highly recommend this company for their excellent pool design and great/responsive customer service!
__label__5	Love the theme-named burgers...and the vegetarian friendly menu for my daughter! This place you wouldn't see unless you were looking for it... Kind of a hole in the wall... The ambience is small but fun, the menu was my favorite part reading all the descriptions and the names of the entrées! As a fan of scary movies we had a lot of good laughs... The good food was a bonus!
__label__1	Should be called Low end BBQ. Hardly any smoke flavor to any of the meats. Knew I  should be worried about going to a BBQ joint and you cant smell any cooking. Sides were average at best. Between this place and City (shitty) BBQ,  Indy really needs to work on their BBQ scene. I miss the grand old days of Zebs, Ma and Pa's, and Sam's Hickory BBQ.
__label__2	"This place use to be the bomb. Now it is not worth the $, find another hidden gem as this one has lost its luster. I ordered a $47 Australian Wagu NY strip medium  rare. It was way too salty and when I told the waiter he said he could take it back to the kitchen remove the salty demi glaze it had been soaking in and put another ""sauce"" on it. Really, Stephen (owner), you should have offered another suitable solution."
__label__1	If I can give negative reviews I would, bunch of kids working here my fiancé was literally in the mist of talking making an appointment and the chick ignored us completely and started talking with a coworker. It's rude and unprofessional so surprised this small ugly ass shop is up and running . Don't waste your time here if you're going to spend a hefty amount here let the service be worth it too and that's not here.
__label__3	"This is a good bbq chain that does thinhs in the community.  I was happy when they came to nj, I used to go all the time in Maryland.  My favorites are the pulled brisket sandwich,  burnt ends brisket, and the sausage. For sides get the mac and cheese trust me! !!
Sauce selection is awesome faves are Memphis belle and KL!!"
__label__3	"My favorite spot to eat in this place is at the bar.  Its the best part to see the bartenders in action while being able to people watch.  The bar here is also plenty comfortable enough to have a full meal.

This is good location to get some of that 'New Orleans' food.  I would definitely recommend sharing one of the large sampler plates with a friend.  The fried chicken here is some of the best, most juicy, fried chicken I have had in a long time.  Pair that up with a beer or three and you'll be just right."
__label__3	"The food here is hit or miss. Most of the appetizers are a safe bet, but the entrees I've had are all disappointing: underwhelming sea bass, dry chicken brochette, and funky ground sirloin. The desserts are pretty good, though a baklava option would be nice. 

It comes down to inauthenticity: instead of just being gourmet versions of classic Mediterranean fare, too many of the dishes here stray too far from their roots in a way that favors concept over execution."
__label__5	Great fun restaurant. Very Authentic food. Tasted great. Clean restaurant. Great ambiance. Very pleasant experience.  Sampler platter was awesome. Highly recommended. Will be back.
__label__1	Bf ordered a chicken bacon wrap for me.It tasted so delicious I enjoyed every bite of the wrap ...But by the the time night fell I was horribly sick.  TMI KINDA SICK... Sorry I will never eat at lees hoagie shop again......
__label__5	My mother used to take me to Riviera Club when I was little. I loved to swim in the giant pool and I  remember getting chocolate soft ice cream there. I think Dad would play tennis? This would have been like 1948 Still have fond memories. Carole Matthews Pompano Beach Fla larcr@msn.com
__label__5	our favorite neighborhood bar. great service and atmosphere for a chill night in east nashville
__label__1	I have eaten here before and unfortunetly the owner there is a compete jerk, he is rude and has zero customer service  skills. I really wanted to like this place but I can't. Please don't eat here
__label__5	Just moved to AZ. We had to re-title 3 vehicles - user friendly - knowledgeable and willing to sort out the difficult obstacles that come with DMV. Very spacious and clean location .
__label__2	Food was nothing special, staff was HORRENDOUS!!! standing around, talking to each other, not paying attention. we had to ask for our fries, and they were cold!!
__label__5	Ate there for the first time today. Now that's a burger. Ultra tasty. Great fries and malt too.
__label__1	Worst customer service at the photo center! Janell claimed the photo lab didn't open until 9 am, which the website says 7am. My photos were supposed to be ready at 7:50am. I came in at 8:15. They hadn't even been printed. She was rude! Not the customer service etiquette... where the customer is always right! No apology, tried to explain herself! No, ya just say sorry no excuses!
__label__5	"I still can't get my wife to go here because she is serious about her fitness, but also has a love affair and no self control when it comes to southern food.  I love all the New Restaurants in Nashville, but Monell's is an original that can hold it's own.  There are only a handful of the Old Nashville restaurants that I think can claim this.  

Southern cooking done just right with something added to make everything amazing.  The secret ingredient must be love, or lard, I'm not sure which, but whatever they use it is amazing."
__label__3	Loved the online wait list. Food was okay. I had to send it back twice. They were really busy but my boyfriend loved his food!! My coworkers raves about this place so I had to go by and try it
__label__1	"We waited over 40 minutes to get our food, bit they still didn't have enough time to cook our grits. Our waitress went on break and nobody covered our table and she said ""there was nothing she could do to make our visit better"". They knocked 20% off the bill like that made it all better. We had to go get our own silverware and couldn't get refills on our water. If you are hungry, do yourself a favor and go anywhere else."
__label__5	Wonderful tour! Lynx was so fun and engaging. He had great stories and stayed true to the facts! They keep the group's smaller and it makes for a more personal experience!!!
__label__3	We've had both good and not very good pizza here over the years. After picking up a takeout meat lovers pizza that seemed to have been sitting around for some time before we got it, I tried ordering a non standard pizza on line to ensure we got a fresh pizza. The on line ordering system is just lousy. No excuse for this they are a chain not a single business.
__label__5	Stopped in for some local coffee. Great vibe! I got a large pour over coffee (slow drip), mad3 extra strong. Thr service was great by rhe barista. If I am in the area again, I will come back and try th3 teas!
__label__5	Great experience at St Pete Brewing! I loved the Tallboy DIPA. The service was great. They were having a private party but graciously invited us in for the fun. I'm glad we stopped in! Tons of great seasonable beer for you IPA snobs our there.
__label__1	Went in for blueberry picking and to buy some wine. Due to circumstances was unable to do either. Needless to say I was disappointed. They could have kept me as a patron however, but there was no customer service at all. The employees were no help boarding on rude. The manager wouldn't talk to me. And the person in charge of media, who I messaged about blueberry picking to begin with while apologetic didn't offer a single thing to make it right. There were things they probably could have done to keep me as a customer instead they lost me as a customer for good.
__label__1	Can't even sit a group of 8 trying to buy a bunch of pitchers on a Thursday. Choose elsewhere
__label__4	Very good fried chicken! Crunchy and moist. Most importantly cooked through. Good potato salad. 12 pieces for $20. Located in a house with a big metal chicken sitting outside. The service was very nice and home spun. Not the kind of place I would eat in. More of a take out place. Very casual.
__label__5	"My go-to spot for repairs in the city!

I had a Sansui QR-4500 serviced and an idler wheel replaced on old portable turntable. Both great experiences. The work was done quickly.

$21 cash diagnostic fee when you drop things off. Its applied to the repair.

Pro Tip: If you're not sure you want the work done and want an estimate, make sure you indicate that when you drop off."
__label__5	My coworker found this place on Yelp so we decided to try it out. Delish! Since it was my first time, I stuck with the basics - chicken and shrimp tacos. Everything was freshly cooked and tasted great.  The salsa that was provided was very good also. We sat in the restaurant and ate. The service was fast as well. Definitely give this place a try!
__label__5	There is no better place in Tampa to have your car washed. It is almost like a detailing and the best deal of unlimited washes for $20 a month.
__label__3	Everyone says this is Dave and busters on steroids but it was really nothing special. Bowling ally, pool, and huge arcade is what's there. Prices aren't bad. I'd recommend getting the $40 205 credit card to play arcade games. It's a better deal. I split it with my friend. Some of the games were out of order. There's also a food area where they serve pizzas, burgers and fries, beer etc. personally I'd rather go to Dave and Busters.
__label__5	Delicious! Service was great too. I had the Cajun sausage omelette. I would definitely recommend it and visit this place again.
__label__5	Matt and his crew are the most genuine people you will ever meet. They know there stuff. I recommend them to anyone who is wanting to learn to surf and have an awesome time  and experience.
__label__3	"Overall a pretty good place, but charging an ""MCI charge"" of just over $2 is low form. That's a charge for them calling you to tell you that your car is ready. It's a really insignificant amount for both sides, since it's a small percentage of the overall bill. Tom, you should get rid of that charge. MCI hasn't been around forever..."
__label__2	Service blows. Service is bad. Sad for such a nice place. Water tastes like it came out of a hose..
__label__5	"Great Breakfast, fast, great service.  Beautifully prepared eggs Benedict- lox was perfect.  
Edmonton institution!"
__label__2	"Accurate name because the Gold Standard no longer exists. The food is average. The server was not a addition to the setting,
sloppy dressed and his nails were dirty. I wasn't expecting too much. But, having read the reviews , and eaten having eaten Philly, it was a let down. 
The space is  very clean."
__label__5	There is a reason why they are called the king.  The food is quite tasty. The people working inside are friendly.  And you can get full for cheap. What's not to love?
__label__4	"I never thought I'd say this because I've had some pretty bad experiences at other waffle houses but I really like this waffle house.

The wait staff is really nice, the place is clean, and my food comes quickly. Also this is one of the few (only?) places open 24hrs in Avondale.

I'm also a big fan of the sausage gravy and biscuits."
__label__3	Still about the same we went back in few people complaining We just held it in and said let's go to Harley Dawn's she's got new seats LOL thank God my butt is to be sore she did a good job shame others are doing it they should talk to her or check out her diner
__label__4	"Very convenient. 
Packed with all types of beer and alcohol.
Also offered Unique types of Cider. 
Not great customer service but not bad either ... Lol
Not much else you can say about a liquor shop except
Beer before liquor have no fear
Liquor before beer never been sicker"
__label__2	"Family dinner Dec 23.
Overall impression- just a little chaotic.
Maximum patron seating shoehorned into main dining area. Booths stacked laterally in center of room instead of tables.
Service reasonable but inattentive. 
Good chips and salsa; bland but fresh guacamole. Extensive drinks menu- but we were there for the food.
Four orders of mole enchiladas. Dry.
Fajitas looked good. Moderate amounts of food.
Convenient at far south end of town, but won't be in a hurry to go back. Not recommended."
__label__4	Food was good, the drink menu is a bit hipster not my favorite but it's fine. Mini gold was cute and fun. Great for dates or groups
__label__5	We stumbled across Marilyn's at around noon on a Saturday looking for brunch. They sat us right away which was amazing. The decor and ambience of the whole place is super cool and makes it a much needed trendy, retro, visit.  Our server Danny was wonderful. He was super knowledgeable on the menu and recommended wonderful drink pairings. This menu is definitely a new favorite.
__label__1	A failed attempt by a Chinese restaurant to make Thai food. Sad, especially given it's right around the corner from an outstanding Asian supermarket and well-rated Vietnamese. Stay away.
__label__5	Really great food and service. Bodie took excellent care of us. A simple but well thought out menu. Everything we tried was fantastic. First time here but won't be our last.
__label__2	Not bad. It's a sandwich shop. The help is bored and indifferent, had to ask 2 different people for a spoon but the food is ok.
__label__5	This place is great eat in nice and clean or take out really fast service one of my favorite places to eat the food is delicious... I got the steak fajita potato it's huge enough for lunch tomorrow
__label__5	Visited here on my last trip down to visit the folks.  One of the top 10 breakfasts EVER.  Delicious, fast, and very reasonably priced.  And the wait staff is fabulous.  Lots of diners in the area but we're willing to wait in line to eat here!
__label__4	We got the Bruschetta pizza, which was delicious. However, I thought that the pizza was too small for the price they charged us.
__label__3	The food was tasty but there was fat with gristle in the pulled pork.  For the price, we were disappointed.   We will try again, but the drive from Bradenton wasn't worth it.  I wish the portions were larger.
__label__1	I've been a member at lifetime athletic Franklyn since opening, and last time I went to the gym I was discuses!! .  So I went to shower and there were literally, parasites infesting the shower box.  Literally, I lay $140.00 per month for a gym, the least I would expect is that the showers and the gym would be clean.  I will post videos and I HOPE that I don't get a disease from this.  I contacted management and nothing was done....  ABSURD!!!
__label__3	"Went here for brunch one day with a party of 6 or 7; the food was tasty and my portion was just the right size. Our waitress was not particularly friendly and the decor needs a major makeover. However, service was fast and I seem to remember clean bathrooms- very important to me.
I probably wouldn't return again on my own, since I don't eat meat and so tend towards Asian cuisine, but when church buddies demand it I'm happy to tag along.:)"
__label__4	Stayed one night at this hotel.  The room was clean and the bed was very comfortable.  The only problem I had was the noise from the people in the room above us.  Did not have breakfast at the hotel (it was a breakfast buffet for $10), but there was a Cracker Barrel very close by.  I am from this area, so for me the hotel was very easy to find.  I would definitely stay here again.
__label__4	The food is delicious and well executed. The wine list is pretty impressive.  Our server was great and attentive.  A wonderful place to eat after a day at the Grounds for sculpture.
__label__5	The menu is varied and is all delicious! I'm not a beer person, but folks in my group liked it. The cocktails are different, original, and great! I highly recommend this place for lunch, dinner, or just for drinks/snacks.
__label__1	I hate this subway! I got take out today and I ordered and payed for two cookies. I left excited to eat my cookies. When I got home my cookies where not in the bag. I called and asked to speak with manager and they hung up on me. This is unacceptable! Anyone who continues to come to this subway is a heathen and is helping perpetuate this injustice. I will get my cookies!!!!!
__label__4	I tried two beers and they were good.  The flavor combinations and the names are very unique.  My husband enjoyed his as well. The atmosphere is quiet and relaxed to enjoy talking with other people.  It is very hidden in an industrial complex so you need GPS to find this place (not visible from the road at all).
__label__4	Great location in the heart of the CBD!  The turkey burger was a-h-maze served on a sweet bun!  It comes with waffle fries and this honey mustard that is deelish!  Yum, just thinking about it makes me wanna go back tonight. Watch out Phil's Grill.
__label__4	"The first time I went here, I went for the burger that a friend talked up. It was pretty good, but I was slightly disappointed. They definitely cook it a little more than I would expect, so if you're a medium type of guy I'd consider medium rare. 
That said, I did notice that the menu looked great so I returned for dinner and had the short rib special, which was pretty much amazing. 
Basically, it's a great dinner spot, but they lose a star for overcooking my first burger and for also being slightly pricier than they probably should be."
__label__1	Filthy.  Went on Sunday for lunch and floors have food and even hair on them. Bathrooms are gross. The food is average. Better wings at chix n bowls.  Given how long it took them to open we were surprised at how worn it looked. Pass.
__label__1	Was not impressed my Shlomos. We went in on a Friday at 7pm. Took over 45 minutes to make two sub sandwiches. They were huge, but the quality was awful. The meat in my philly was so stringy and overdone it wasn't edible. Won't be visiting again.
__label__5	Love this spot, love the management, wait staff, food, drinks, music, Tiki bar below, AND brunch!
__label__4	Make sure to make a reservation.  I didn't think I would need one on a Tuesday night but made the reservation just in case.  Good thing I did make the reservation, there was a wait for those who did not.  The service was great and the salmon fabulous.   I do wish I had picked to sit outside because inside was so loud that  I had to yell just for my friend to hear me.  They do need to do something about the acoustics.
__label__3	Food was alright, certainly not one of our better dinners on the trip. The filet was dry and poorly seasoned. The sides were not great either. I do like the fresh baked bread that they bring to the table and the service was great. If you're looking for a steak, try someplace else
__label__5	Excellence!!! The place is great in all aspects. The ambiance is very nice, not very noisy, and family friendly. It has a beautiful bar, and great decor. The food it's fingers licking good. I also wanted to add that the service is fenomenal, I would love to recommend our waiter, but not sure about his name, it could me Frank. He was amazing. I give this place two thumbs up!
__label__5	With Latte's for my lucky loves and Macaroons for the Mac Daddy (me), Sucre Lakeside one seriously sweeeeeeet spot.  They keep it real, no fake in that cupcake.  Sometimes I go there with my bros for gelato's, or I might call my girl to see if she wants the caramel swirl.  Great spot.  Rock star staff.  Oh, and the manager.  She be killin it.  I don't want no cake on birthday, I want dat Sucre errday!
__label__5	"BEST 
I MEAN THE BEST BURGERS IN TOWN. The Nevadan is my fav the french fries are a huge pile and the milkshakes are great and made the old fashion way. We tell all our friends"
__label__5	I've been wanting to try Long's Bakery doughnuts since I saw them on a list on FB for being one of the top places to go for a good doughnut. I had the glaze. Simple but very good. It was very chewy with the right amount of glaze. The only bad thing is that I can't eat just one. I will definitely go back and try other favors. My friend that was with me had the apple sauce doughnut. She was very pleased!
__label__5	Still my favorite restaurant in SB. Kale salad was deliciously bright with earthy toasted sunflower notes. Risotto was perfectly executed with loads of mushrooms. Deconstructed cassoulet was scrumptious. Donut trio sinfully yummy. Great service.
__label__5	There food has really improved recently. Top notch. My favorite nashville indian place. Be careful about requesting dishes too spicy however
__label__5	Always one of our favorites. Long time go to place. Everything is always fresh and the ponzu sauce they use is the best I've ever had. Food and service are consistently good, I enjoy trying the specials that change frequently.
__label__4	"This restaurant gets four stars for their customer service, price, and the quality of the sushi for price you pay. Their all you can eat option is extensive, just don't let your eyes get bigger than your stomach!

Most of their ""special rolls"" consisted of the same ingredients, in different ways. It was still delicious, nonetheless. I wish they would add more to their nigiri/sashimi options for their all you can eat, but I do understand they do have to save on costs. Overall great experience and would definitely come here again the next time I'm in Tucson!"
__label__5	best pizza and cheese steak in philadelphia bread homemade every morning by owner just amazing from cutlets to meatballs to squares and circles angelos does it right personal fav is the tony head witch is a garlic bread cheese steak if u are looking for phiily food its here
__label__2	"Since moving from the Bay Area, I have trouble finding a good Mexican spot...until I came here! The food here was always so fresh, delicious, and exciting too. 

However, the last time I got food here, I found a long black hair embedded in my quesadilla! I couldn't even pull it out. It was literally stuck inside the cheese and tortilla :(( 

I really wanna come back because I love this place. I hope management sees this and does something about it."
__label__2	Nice, courteous people -archaic process.  Maybe that's par for a downtown rental counter, or the Deep South, but I'm used to the 2 minute process at every other rental outfit. 30 minutes to pick up the car (they said it was being cleaned, it was certainly wet but not more than that), 20 minutes to return it. Plan accordingly.
__label__3	Just okay. I have only been there twice but it isn't overly great or bad either. They send out coupons in the mail often so maybe wait for one if your on the fence about trying. So so hamburger and hotdogs. Ice cream is just okay too
__label__1	This place made me very uncomfortable. No music, no people and the guys are very high strung. The atmosphere was for sure negative. Not sure if this is an all the time thing or just tonight, but not a good first impression.
__label__5	Excellent products, treatments ranging from wax to facials and massage. I highly recommend Skin Resolutions! Megan Husbands is amazing!
__label__1	"Awful service. Took 2 hours for a mani pedi. The people kept waking away from me to go do other things. The woman that did my manicure was talking to her two kids (that were running around the store and climbing on all the chairs) and she was on her phone texting people the entire time. Took so long and the people working there were sort of rude. 
If you want to relax while getting pampered, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE."
__label__4	This place is yummy.  It's in a good location and it's great to buy a slice for lunch.
__label__1	We just finished our Valentines and 50th anniversary dinner at the St. Petersburg location. We spend $160 dollars for a subpar meal and poor service. We had to ask for every drink refill. It was close to an hour before the main dish came out. The food was delivered but no one came back to ask how the steak was. My husband's steak was not cooked the way he wanted and was tough. The baked potatoes was dry and over cooked. Couldn't wait to leave. I feel cheated. This was supposed to be a very special occasion.  Won't go back.
__label__5	These guys are great! I called about repairing/replacing our pool blower for the hot tub and they were able to come out the next day to check things out. It needed to be replaced which is what we assumed was the case so they ordered one and came out the following day. The technician was polite and professional. Overall, they were a easy to communicate and schedule with. We will definitely be using them more in the future. Highly recommend!
__label__3	"Happy to update:
I heard from the offices new manager today, and she seems hopeful changes are coming. The dishwasher is going to be fixed, also."
__label__1	This is by far the slowest fast food I've ever been to. It's insane. Sitting in drive thru for 17 minutes and only two cars ahead of me. This chicken better be magnificent, because this wait is crazy. I can see through the drive thru that it's dirty. Perhaps I should cancel my order... The cashier took five minutes to come to the window after I pulled up and when she did, she was trying her best to hurry and was nice but damn. Won't come back
__label__2	Only bbq for a while around the area. That's it's only saving grace. Does not hold a candle to a place like 4 rivers...or anywhere else for that matter. Way overpriced, don't have fries as a side option, would hardly matter because they suck anyways. The ONLY good thing is the gold bbq sauce. That stuff is FIRE. some of the best bbq sauce I've had.
__label__5	This place is worth the hype for any breakfast lover. I went for the cakes and eggs (scrambled). The buttermilk pancakes are just like you want them. Light. Fluffy. Sweet but not too sweet.
__label__5	Great food, great beer, and amazing music by Justin at the upstairs bar!  Do not miss.
__label__5	Everyone in the pharmacy is so polite. It makes such a difference and I appreciate it so much. The man who seems to be the manager is very kind to customers, making this a great example of top down leadership!
__label__5	"Great little independent cafe in downtown Doylestown. 

The drip coffee is excellent. The avocado toast is excellent, if a touch pricey. The breakfast sandwich options are really tasty.

The place is spotlessly maintained, with frequent cleaning and sanitizing of the limited seating areas.

What's more, the customer service is outstanding. Every employee I've met there is polite, friendly and genuinely thankful and appreciative for each customer.

Definitely worth visiting."
__label__5	There's a new biscuit sheriff in town. These biscuits are out of this world, best I've ever had and that includes another well known establishment in the Gulch area. Not even close. Went with the fried green tomato biscuit. It had 2 very nice size tomato's on there with pimento cheese. It's one of those place you just want to keep eating. Don't miss this place.
__label__5	privebest product in market place. you can easily see difference. price was fair and install crews very professional
__label__3	"The Dixie chicks was delicious but the Bianca sauce was a miss for me and I wasnt a huge fan of the wings. 

Willing to try again but will order something different or just no Bianca sauce."
__label__3	Walking I to this place be prepared to smell like cigarettes for the night! Other then the smoke this bar has pool tables, electronic dj and multiple dart boards! The drinks were not mixed properly because I received one on the heavy side and then one on the light side. Other then that this dive bar had an assortment of people and felt welcoming. The bartenders tended to their costumers in a timely manner.
__label__5	I ordered a margarita pizza. It was amazing!!!! Fresh topping and crispy crust. The atmosphere is defiantly pizzeria.
__label__5	"Came for Taco Tuesday!! Can't be beat! 
This Latino owned company out of California is a great addition to Tucson food scene. Not only is their prepared food great, but the coffee shop is amazing, as well. Groceries are ready for you to take home & make a meal. The best!"
__label__5	The tasting menu here is the way to go! The first course always has so many interesting dips and food and I love that they take you outside for a course to their wood fire oven! This is my favorite restaurant in St. Louis.
__label__4	"Best bloodies in the French Quarter!  Hit this place after grabbing a few beers on Bourbon.  One sip of this bloody and I gave out a big ol' shout!  ""God dayum that's a good bloody!!"".  Then promptly ordered a second.  I'm no foodie, but this was really good and worth a little skirt off Bourbon St."
__label__4	"Typically not busy here because I don't think most people know about it, this is Diamonds attempt at a high end restaurant. Overall the good was good but not outstanding , the coffee grounds steak was good but my wife had to send it back multiple times we always order medium rare and the first time it was well done, second time it was not even cooked, theirs time came out medium well. A little disappointing for a $25-30 steak.

Overall the service was good and hopefully we will have a better experience next time."
__label__2	If you enjoy soggy fried chicken skin this is the place for you.  Gross!
__label__5	18/10 experience with Cory as the waiter. I hope he had a good ass night. I would die for Cory.
__label__4	My sister and I finally got around to trying this place.  Very small, homey type place.  The food was awesome!  Best guacamole I've ever had!  Everything seemed very fresh.  I had the seafood quesadillas and my sister had the beef tacos.  Both were delicious!  Our server was great and we will definitely be back.  If you're thinking about trying this place, stop thinking and do it!  :)
__label__3	Meh, I'm a huge pizza fan but was not impressed. Pizza is slightly above average but is expensive. Ordered the Garlic knots (swimming in grease) and two topping custom pizza (like I said, slightly above average). For some perspective, my fav pizza joints are (or were depending on the joint) Jets, Circle City, Barlo's and all have better pizza...
__label__1	Not very impressed, staff is NEVER friendly and they couldn't even send my prescription in like they said they would. This is my absolute last resort when I'm sick.
__label__3	This isn't specific to this particular location as the restaurant itself and service here are fine. This chain just isn't very good. The pita bread is the only thing that's decent. Other than that, the rice is bland, the chicken is dry and bland...everything is bland. It almost seems like they dye the food interesting colors to make it look flavorful given that I can't taste any of the spices. Fast food Mediterranean food isn't a new concept, so there really isn't a good excuse why the food here should be so mediocre.
__label__5	Lucas is a great employee and runs his shifts very well. Our food was out super fast and it tasted great! The cookies were so good and the chip selection was huge!!!
__label__1	Ugh.  Charleys, what happened? Usually their food is decent. Yesterday they got both my orders wrong after explaining the order back three times. Then my partner and I both got food poisoning.  They need better trained staff front and back of house.  Major concerns. I am not likely to be back.
__label__5	Steve really helped me out in a pinch when another contractor really messed up a job and reneged on contracts. He made time for me and my family and finished the work beautifully as promised in the time frame promised. I'd highly recommend Steve - principled and honest.
__label__5	Delicious! This home style Korean food place is the best. It is perfect to take to go and enjoy.
__label__4	I've eaten here a few times over the years.  As with the rest of Gulfport, it is very quaint.  It serves good seafood dishes in a relaxed atmosphere.
__label__5	One of the best cafeterias I have ever experienced. The cafeteria is a dying breed of restaurants. However this establishment brings heart to the industry. The meals here are simply awesome. Everything is made from scratch with multiple selections. I actually wanted everything from the bar. You cannot go wrong by eating here. A must eat when visiting this area.......
__label__5	I visited Sierra RV Service Department to obtain help connecting a new power supply cord to my RV. Misty in the Service Department was very helpful - she spoke to one of her mechanical technicians, who immediately assisted me with my project. The technician attached (crimped) some electrical ring terminals to my power supply cable so I could connect the new cable to my cord reel. The job was highly professional, with heat-shrink insulation applied to each cable/terminal. I am highly impressed with the level of service provided by both Misty and the service technician. Misty was wonderful. I will definitely shop here for all my RV needs.
__label__3	Service prompt but not particularly friendly.  Food was good but probably wouldn't come back for it or recommend it highly. Spirit sampler was good.  Had pork loin sandwich with cheese and pear.
__label__4	Decent food, friendly staff and great beer prices. Great venue to watch sports, the tv's are huge and everywhere. Every seat is a good seat.If it wasn't close I wouldn't go out my way to come here, but it is, so I will return.
__label__3	"45 minute wait in line and 30 minutes later...

Fried chicken was good. I love the texture of the crust but it was just a little too salty for my taste. Green beans and rice for my side were okay. Definitely need to go here yourself and give it a try."
__label__5	Shannon gave me the best split end treatment of my life. I get one done every 4-6 weeks in between my haircuts and it really helped me keep my hair healthy since i'm growing it out. She's so thorough and really takes her time to insure I have the best experience every time. I love her!
__label__3	"I thought Joey Ks was fair. The food wasn't horrible it was just lacking a little flavor/seasoning. However, The pricing is reasonable. 

I was with a huge group and the food came pretty fast too. Overall, good spot for lunch with that New Orleans type of vibe, that vibe includes food and atmosphere/decor."
__label__5	We went on a recommendation and it didn't disappoint. Our group of 7 from Texas sat on the patio. Great service, great drinks (and selection) and great food. The queso was definitely a favorite for our table, but so was the pulled pork and tortillas.
__label__4	"One downside of suburban life is lack of exciting and interesting food scene.  At least compared to the center city. I was glad that I tried this place, which was differ other Vietnamese place.

Food was well prepared and playing was nice. It is a bit pricey compared to typical Vietnamese restaurant, and it has a short menu list.  But it was definitely worth a try."
__label__1	An ABSOLUTELY FILTHY ball shooter area that's so thick with dirt and dust it's unlike anything you've ever seen. See the photos. How the owner ignores this is beyond me. Don't go with allergies or you'll be sneezing and hacking the whole time. My wife had to leave because of an allergy attack. Disgusting and inexcusable. The rest of the place is great and kids love it. The star rating is for the entirety unacceptable filth. For God's sake, people, clean up that shithole.
__label__1	Delivery guy was a lunatic.  Be very careful getting take out from this pizza place!!!
__label__4	"This was great!  Out shopping all day, called 411 for a #, hit this on my way into the city.  Interestingly there is no seating.  You order, you go home and eat.  General Tso's chicken was fantastic.  Fried rice was great, egg-roll was for the ride.

I'll be back when in the area!"
__label__1	id give it a NEGTIVE 5 stars its shitty dog food waiters that past it on as human food
__label__5	I've been waiting for some perfect BBQ since I moved up here from Texas six years ago. Got the brisket, potato salad and mac cheese. GRADE A+ BBQ!!! The brisket melts in your mouth. Sooooo good!!
__label__5	Never been to Nashville before and the valet guy recommended Martin's. Very glad we listened to him! Service was amazing, everyone there was super friendly and gave suggestions on their fav menu item. We ordered a Big Momma Sampler and my son got the Brisket burger. Any and all of their meats were smoky and delicious. The brisket melts!! Their hot and spicy bbq sauce is not for the faint of heart. Great fun atmosphere
__label__5	Dropped in for a quick bite before jumping on the St. Charles streetcar.  Got our pizzas quickly, about 15 minutes.  It was delicious, and the owners were very accommodating with our large group.  Perfect for a midday break.
__label__4	Great chicken tacos. Savory with enough kick, so I didn't have to reach for the hot sauce. The place is casual so you order at a counter and bring your food to the table yourself. Unfortunately the cashier was pretty rude, but the tacos are worth putting up with it.
__label__3	There are limited Thai options in this area and little Thai is just mediocre. I have tried their curries, pad Thai, drunken noodles and Tom yum and really nothing stood out. Still looking for a good Thai place in the cherry hill area
__label__3	It's a airforce coffee stand... not much to write home about. The staff are nice and the beer selection is good. The only downside is if you are trying to get your caffeine fix in the morning get there early because you and half the hotel seems to be in line for a cuppa.
__label__2	The wait time was about right, 15 minutes. When we were seated however, the waiter took just as long. I had to ask another server to find ours. He wasn't polite at all. Just asked what we wanted. I only saw him 2 more times after that. We waited forever for seconds on our drinks and the food took so long that we filled up on chips. Then at the end we gave the server a coupon and I was told it only works for the original grill, not the fiesta grill. Something about different owners. I was very disappointed and will probably never go back.
__label__2	Last Saturday, my kids and her gal friend were hungry at late night. I ordered those foods for them. Fried fries were too salty. I wish they use less salt. My son said bbq boneless chicken was good.
__label__5	What a perfect local bookshop!  I stopped by for the first time yesterday with my son looking for a particular book, which i quickly found, and was amazed by the variety they have.  The kid's section was amazing and had not only a wide range of books, but activity books, craft kits, etc.   He wanted about 18 different things there, so I now know where to go for birthday presents/gifts.   Will definitely be back.
__label__2	I've been shoping at Kroger, Ralphs and Smiths for about 40 years. This particular one needs some help. I self-checked and there was a problem with some prices. Because I had already paid, I was asked to go stand in the Customer Service line as #5 in line for help. Nope - I left and just won't return. There's a Sprouts across the street and a Walmart at the next exit on 580.  I see the reviews on the rights side of this screen as I type aren't very good, so I'm not alone.
__label__4	"My wife and I had dinner on Saturday, March 10th... I had the Mayan Shrimp... shrimp, wrapped in bacon, with queso dripped over it. It was absolutely fantastic!

The service can be a bit slow, but Mexican Table is always extremely busy and the food is fantastic!"
__label__5	"My very first visit to this salon today.  I couldn't be more pleased!  Relaxed, lovely decor, and friendly staff.  Imelda did my color and cut; she was so patient and kind!  I was a bit nervous because my hair was really damaged from another salon, but she corrected the color and damage, did bayalage highlights, and gave me a super cut.  Then a FABULOUS blowout by Vanessa.
   I highly recommend Ambiance Salon and Spa!  It was really a great experience!"
__label__5	Absolutely love this spot, stumbled on it while visiting St Pete for a stint and came back several times a week. Great food, great coffee, good music, great environment to get some work done, and the customer service is through the roof excellent!! Love the family-owned atmosphere and great locals recommendations too. A++++
__label__5	I love breakfast food, so this place is perfect for me. It's helpful they have wax sticks for kids to play with while we wait for our food. I always recommend Two Chicks when people are looking for a brunch or breakfast place.
__label__5	I basically go there every Sunday.  Fish tacos with truffle fries. Nicole, our usual server is awesome.
__label__5	This secret organic farm is located off Tom Folsom road in Thonotosassa.    There are Saturday markets and during strawberry and blue berry Season you can pick fresh berries.     There are also wildflowers and sunflowers for picking.    The prices are reasonable and it is a good place to keep the kids occupied for a couple of hours.    We go there about 3-4 times a year to see the goats and chickens, then pick the berries that are in season.
__label__5	Wow. Just had almost every appetizer and the chicken parmesan for the main event.  This place is firing on ALL CYLINDERS.  Quality food, phenomenal service and this is what Italian fare is about.  INCREDIBLE. EAT HERE NOW.
__label__1	When we arrived at the restaurant we specifically requested booth seating and we were told that the booths were only available to those with reservations.  At this time there was only one booth taken.  We were seated at a small table in the rear of the restaurant.  When we were leaving,  we noticed that the same booths as earlier were still empty.  Why did we have to deal with a table in the back when there were so many booths available?
__label__5	These guys were wonderful. They were the first to respond. I have had problems with squirrels in my attic of my Florida home and this was the 3rd time they found a weakness in the screening and chewed through. Not only did they have a nest, there were also bite marks on the fascia as they were trying to get in again after we screened the hole and did and chewed some wiring to boot. Both Taylor and Eric responded and installed aluminum covers quickly and also performed other services. Both were always available when I had questions and responded quickly. I would highly recommend this company.
__label__5	Possibly my new favorite Thai place in town.
__label__5	"I'm very satisfied with these folks. They told me they'd fit me in the same evening - although they did warn me that they were quite busy and I would likely have to wait a while. Understandable under the circumstances.

John was quite nice abut things and went the extra mile to make sure I was satisfied.

Recommend highly."
__label__5	"Outstanding!! I had dinner with my wife there last night to celebrate Valentine's Day! Everything was excellent. I'd say it is definitely in the Top 10 of  NOLA eating establishments. Service was outstanding !!! I highly recommend the ""Taste Of New Orleans"" & the Sundae. Living in NOLA,  one never has to eat @ any restaurant twice because there are so many fine eateries to choose from. The Upperline is one of those I'll definitely return to."
__label__5	Came to grab a quick drink and watch the game! Accommodated me right away even though they were busy! Bartenders were consistent and friendly! Also the pizza is soooo good!!
__label__5	I like to consider myself a NY style pizza foodie. I love the how the cheese, pepperoni, sauce, and homemade crust mingle on my taste buds (not to mention the drippings). This was my first visit to Celebre Pizzeria and they did not disappoint. My cheese and pepperoni pizza was ready early and tasted awesome. Celebre ranks in my top 5 NY style  pizza experiences. I will definitely be back!
__label__1	The customer service, scheduling and care in this center is absolute garbage. I do not recommend.
__label__1	Gross place. Smelt like marijuana, kids were running around while Tattoo was done. Go to Reno Tattoo. The owner is strung out.
__label__5	We've been here twice on two separate vacations. Food is always good and the service is always quick and friendly!
__label__2	I ordered delivery through Grubhub. After I had two tacos, I found a hair in the taco shell of the third... I'm not sure if the shells are home made, if they are, then please be aware and ask the staff to wear hairnets or hats when making them. If not, please talk to your supplier.. it was a long hair too and the feeling of pulling it out of the taco shell was disgusting. The flavor of the tacos were just lackluster too
__label__4	Best pub in NOLA. The five brew sampler was a tasty treat to go with the baked brie appetizer. Food was fab and the service was entertaining. Our server was a complete ditz but she was honest about it. It's a good hangout spot to meet friends, come on a date, or get some writing done during any lulls throughout the day. The interior is awesome and if the crowds say anything, it's definitely a popular place for all.
__label__3	Good pizza, on the Margherita the tomatoes tasted a little rotten to me....that may have been a combination of the cheeses. the Colossal was great!! Cool pizza joint. Would try it again.
__label__5	Great as always. Great atmosphere, great food, great drinks! Must go too when in Ybor City.
__label__1	A family member spotted a live mouse while dining there. I looked up their health inspections and they revealed roaches and rodents. The last one had a dead mouse caught on a glue board and not removed. Kinda yucky!!
__label__5	Great store. I don't smoke, but I went in to pick up something for a friend. Counter person (may have been owner, don't know) was extraordinarily friendly & helpful. Looked like a great selection of product, and a really nice smoking lounge, if you're into that.
__label__5	Amazing pizza and friendly staff. 5 stars. Supreme is incredible. Definitely should be on your list for great pizza.
__label__5	Publix has the best customer service. They always care about you. How many places will have umbrellas ready for you when it rains and it rains like crazy in Florida. This is the place. They always make me smile bc they are always ready to help you.
__label__4	Went on a weekend night and I felt like I was surrounded by adult yuppies.  But the food is decent tasting and has large portions, but my dish (#60, i forget what it was called) had a slight burnt flavor.  Service was meh.  Spring rolls were yummy.  I could consider returning to the restaurant to try other dishes, but I probably won't.
__label__1	My wife and I came here a time to two, and we decided not to come back anymore. Customer service was getting worse and worse. The employee taking our order was so incredibly unprofessional and rude. We do not frequent this establishment anymore.
__label__5	This is my favorite place to eat out as far as casual restaurants go. I usually get a steak grinder but I've never been unhappy when I decide to mix things up a bit. The garlic cheese bread is really good and is enough to split between two people, four people if you're also ordering something larger. The customer service here is always great. The restaurant is always kept clean.
__label__5	Phenomenal atmosphere, outstanding drinks, and excellent service (thanks, Kerri!).  I came on a winter weeknight and really got to enjoy the space... highly recommended as I imaging this place would be packed on a summer weekend. We tried many drinks (and broke the bank) but have no regrets. Golden Globe was our favorite!
__label__5	"Alex and his team were very polite and easy to work with. Showed up on time and got to work...worked very fast! I was a bit skeptical at first but I'm glad I picked these guys. Price was also very competitive for the quality of work. They diligently packed fragile furniture, kitchen glasses, and our TVs with zero issues.

Would highly recommend"
__label__1	Worse bar ever they let me and all my girlfriends in w/ no problem and they demanded a passport from my guy friend as an excuse to not let him in. Worse damn security's.
__label__5	We love Papa Joe's.  Service at dinner has always been fine and the food delightful.  Casual atmosphere that our out of town guests always appreciate.  So nice to have a local owned restaurant in a sea of chain establishments.
__label__1	"My husband, daughter & son in law were there on 6/20/15. Waited over 1 hr. for our food. Our server's name was Jaime. After waiting over 1 hr. all 4 dinners came out wrong!!!!!!!! Also, my water was not refilled - even had to wait a long time just for ""water"". My husband & I both ordered sizzling fahitas, came out cold!!!! Not an enjoyable experience @ all. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
__label__3	I am a Jersey Mike's fan! Made a mobile order and did curbside pickup. Got home to find my order was wrong. I paid for an item that was not included.... Sad day!
__label__5	Just go! You won't regret it. And try the cheese board. Also an excellent beer selection. If you go on Friday or Saturday night or on Sunday morning, there's live music!
__label__5	Best Pizza ever! We've eaten here twice since staying in Treasure Island. Love this place.  We are a family of four, with two pre-teens. I recommend 2 lrg pizzas unless you get an appetizer, or salad for family of 4 with older children. Very fair price, I think right now they have a special large 2 topping Pizza for $16.  They have other food as well that looked delicious.
__label__3	Let's be honest. It's a Chinese restaurant where a lunch special is around 5 dollars. If you're really hungry and in a rush, this place is fine. This ain't no PF Chang's.
__label__5	"Ordered delivery about 40 minutes before closing time thinking they wouldn't do it or that I would get the worst pizza ever. To my surprise in was good and got here fast. 

Sad part is that I will never try another pizza place in New Orleans because I already found the best."
__label__4	I have been a member for several months. Enjoy classes with Chad, Mike and Roddell. I think Ky is one of the best; she really wants participants to do the exercises correctly. She also is patient. Couple thing I wish they would do is add fans, clean the floor (as many exercises are done on the floor, face down) and have more weekend classes. Other than this, I think they do a great job.
__label__4	the biggest selling point is the local beer selection.  the pizza was good, not phenomenal, but good.  i think there is much more potential there than what it is.  the atmosphere is laid back,  but almost too much so.  the waitstaff was a little too...rehearsed? they didn't seem relaxed at all.  but,  that being said, the bartender was very nice and polite.  we'll go back, maybe for a beer and carryout next time.
__label__5	Incredible place. Amazing atmosphere and food was great! Wonderful seafood selections. Amazing appetizers and best chicken wings I've had ever-- onion rings and blue cheese! Brick oven pizza and incredible deserts ! Oasis in the Promenade !
__label__4	"This used to be a regular haunt, but i hadn't been for a long while. The food was stellar, but my complaint is with the waitstaff.  Our waiter seems disinterested and he
wouldn't put in in our appetizer orders until we had ordered our entrees. Really?  The food will definitely bring me back, the sauce reminds me of my grandmother's house. It's worth overlooking a so-so waiter for great food."
__label__5	When I'd go visit my cousins in Pennsylvania--we'd go to the mall and eat here! It was my favorite place! I loved their chicken nuggets and fries! There was just something about that was so good--probably the fact that it was fast food is why it tasted so good but seriously, I love this place and wish they had one out here in SF!  I'd go nuts for the meal! Drooling! Homer would approve!
__label__5	The sushi chefs here take pride in what they do, and use quality ingredients. They continue to optimise their menu to satisfy every customer, and their knowledge on a Gluten Free diet is impressive. They've spared me many bad decisions in this department.. gluten seems to lurk in the strangest places. They now keep the sushi bar open until close as well.  Joe is fantastic! He takes care in the quality of the food he serves as well as the presentation. Great food, great people!
__label__1	"Stale chips
Ragu was the ""salsa""
Ponchos literally made better enchiladas and Mexican rice  And they Forgot the beans on the side which was probably a blessing.  the ceviche was swimming in liquid and the most tiny pieces of minced fish were in it, I actually had to dump the juice it was in in order to not have to  eat it like a soup... sad"
__label__1	The is restaurant is off my list.  We went Saturday July 6, 2019 around noon. There was one employee working., She took the orders, cooked the food and cashed us out. We sat there for awhile and a guy drinking beer at the bar brought us some menus. The food was mediocre. They bring you a drink in a bottle and you have to pick at the seal to get it off.  I don't know if that is how they staff it or someone called off. Not a good experience.
__label__3	"I haven't been to any other locations so to me this store seemed big.  Lots of different beachy items and t-shirts.  Plenty of touristy type gifts and kitchy items to take home as souvenirs.

It's located in a nice shopping area of Clearwater Beach, I did think it was a little overpriced.  During the day it gets very busy but I found other shoppers friendly and polite.  The staff was attentive at the counter and moved the line quickly although they were very busy."
__label__2	My wife and I tried this place today as most places are closed on Sunday. Great atmosphere and decor, staff friendly but unfortunately when it came down to the Pho. Very bland and needed ALOT of sauces to make it interesting. My wife ordered the Vegan Pho and all the veggies were hardly cooked. The raw cabbage really just made it brothy wet salad. As a chef I would recommended finding some new salty flavors for your broths, their is always great solutions for non MSG food and making sure vegetables leave the kitchen cooked correctly as desired.
__label__3	The food is standard Arby's food, nothing more or less here. The service is good, and there's never a wait here. Overall, I think this is one of the better fast food options here in town.
__label__5	Tried the eggs with eggplant, hollandaise sauce, ham and cheese. They were great. Who would have thought eggplant and eggs would be so good together. Had a fantastic Bloody Mary to boot. Our waiter was super nice and patient.
__label__3	"Good spot for a cheesesteak, very popular, so there's always people eating. 

Good cheesesteak, and you get to look at Pat's across the street, which I find just as good.

Good bread, good meat, onions just right. Had it with the wiz, turns out it's not really my thing, I ended up preferring American in the long run.

If I'm in the area, it's possible that I'll grab a sandwich here and one across the street, like I've done in the past."
__label__5	Excellent selection of BBQ.  Little pricey, but taste definitely on point!  Salmon, baby back ribs, brisket, pulled pork...you can't go wrong.  Selection of sauces to squirt over your choices are great too!
__label__3	I like this place.  They seem to steam a bulk amount of shrimp early so it isn't fresh.  They have these little crawfish pies that are lovely.
__label__1	Third time was not the charm !!! Very disappointed.  We had reservations but waited 20 minutes for someone to come to our table, no bread, steak ordered medium rare and came out well done and baked potatoes were old.No dinner silverware and no follow up after we finished.  We were offered free dessert for the well done steak and after getting up to find the manager because our wait person never returned- took the dessert to go.  The prime rib and add on shrimp were good.
__label__5	"I have been to other tiki bars in Indy and this is my favorite. Low key, not overdone and laid back.   I loved the vibe in here, condo seating, cool vibe. Staff was so fun. Drinks can always be expensive at these bars so we can never hang out long. 

If you are in the area swing by."
__label__3	The food is good and the bar area is great. The beer selection could be better and the service is slow. This review is based on multiple visits within the past few months.
__label__4	If you just need a key copied this place gets the job done. I went in when they opened at 8:30 (not 5:30 like yelp says, this is only for emergencies) and it literally took 1 minute to get the key copied and for me to pay. It cost $3.75, I'm not sure what other places charge but I expected it to cost much much more. Just be sure to bring cash with you. Only inconvenience was that they are closed on Sundays.
__label__4	Though a little overpriced, DiBruno Bros has all of the specialty foods that anyone could ask for. The prices are a bit steep, but it's natural to pay for quality. If you have specific diet needs (Kosher, vegan, gluten free, etc) DiBruno Bros will definitely have something great to offer you.
__label__5	I have been a loyal patron of Mai Lee for years.  They are nestled on a back road behind the BestBuy in Brentwood and despite their location (somewhat hidden) they are always busy and there is good reason.  Their food has never let me down!  I've even ordered off menu (politely asking if it was ok) and the whipped me up a chicken bean sprout crepe that I've since asked for on many visits.  They have earned my business time and again and the staff is always helpful and super friendly.
__label__1	Open 24hrs. Thats y u go. Your tastebuds wont know wat hit them, n thankfully wont remember the next morning. It is rightfully deserted from 5am-midnight but gets enough in those 5hrs to make sure it never dies.
__label__2	Not sure what all the hype is about.  Bad service and luke-warm food was our experience.  Save your money..
__label__4	"Cecil Whittaker gave me 12"" for my birthday. A 12"" one topping pizza and all I had to do was buy two beverages. What a deal. I highly recommend signing up for the VIP Rewards at CWP. In addition to the birthday gift, they have special offerings almost every week that are only available to VIP members. You'll also earn points, to receive more free stuff. 

In addition to the two beverages, we added chicken wings to create a lazy night dinner. I must live in a ""pizza hood"", because all of the pizza joints always have friendly employees."
__label__5	Damian came to my rescue today and I can't express how happy I was with SETi's service!!! My car broke down at 6am on the way to work and after contacting my insurance company they dispatched the tow company. They promised to arrive within 60 minutes but showed up within 20 minutes! He quickly got my car on the tow and brought it to the dealership safely. He was so nice (while I was rather flustered) and professional. I would recommend this company to anyone needing roadside assistance. 5 stars!
__label__5	"Fantastic find on the waterfront in St. Petersburg, Florida. Very romantic downstairs ""Speakeasy"" offering live music, craft cocktails, and wine."
__label__5	"When I am looking for the ""hard to buy for"" gift, this is the place I go. Amazing American Indian feel, clothes, sage and the jewelry pieces are amazing! Great selection of incense and spiritual gifts. Great place and GREAT people running it! If your in Media make it a stop!"
__label__5	I am giving 5 stars for Carla Case who is AMAZING! The front office staff could stand to be a little more courteous and intelligent.
__label__2	13 mile drive for a small,  seemed like day old hard bagel , the whipped cream cheese smooshed out the sides when you bite down, no avocado or vegan spreads available, the place is dark and dingy burnt out bulbs dirty ceiling tiles, nothing reinvested, means they are cheap with ingredients, wifely brought avocado with in anticipation of lack of, her bagel was soft, its nice to sit by the lake and watch the ducks while we eat though
__label__5	This place takes snowballs to a whole new level! Too many specialties to name. I highly recommend the pineapple dream!
__label__4	I love this place. I've loved the salads I've tried, and the sandwiches are good too. I haven't loved the soups yet, but the pomme frittes appetizer was amazing. Super crispy, and the aioli dipping sauce was super good. I recommend it!
__label__3	"Theres a lot to see in this small museum A LOT OF DUST too. We visited here years ago, we were given a guided tour and were allowed to ask questions. This visit we were greated by a grouchy woman who couldn't take our money fast enough so she could get back to her conversation. 

You will get history but dont expect much and you wont be disappointed"
__label__5	I have been to this salon many times and will return.. The pedicure massage chairs are the BEST in this area..
__label__4	"yeah i still like this place, food good, folks nice.

but for god sake when you completely screw up and you know you did the very least you could do is say you are sorry.

until the next time......"
__label__2	I ordered the sashimi bento box and got a few scraps of fish, one third the size of a sushi slice.  Very stingy servings, mediocre at best.
__label__2	Tapas here was pretty weaksauce compared to what I'm used to on the west coast. It's an okay thing for 2-3 people but if you show up in a group of 5 it just becomes an odd struggle where you're paying way too much for some 'just okay' tapas and you only get a small bit. The decor here was pretty RAD... so I do kind of want to give you an extra star for that;  for some reason girls love this place. That also may get you an extra star.... one day.
__label__2	We are fans of Brazilian steakhouses and this  is the most mediocre one we've ever eaten in. They pack the place in with tons of promotions and discounts but to make up for the low prices they sacrifice the quality of food and service. Our waitress would show up very infrequently with our drinks and the gouchos cut the meet to such small slivers you could almost see through some of them. The salad bar didn't have many fresh vegetables but limp looking canned items. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because the person who took our reservation was nice.
__label__4	"Stopped in for dinner after touring the gardens and doing a river boar tour. They had a taco bar going on so we decided to do that. It was very good. The food was fresh and hot! The pulled chicken and ground beef were excellent and I usually don't eat beef. I also enjoyed the sautéed veggies and the chipotle salad dressing. The entire menu sans two items are gluten free which is great.

If you sit outside you can people watch and take in the beauty of all the gardens."
__label__5	Fantastic massages. I would highly recommend this place. I didn't realize how much walking I would be doing in New Orleans. This is exactly what I needed. Is recommend to come here.
__label__4	"I always love shopping here but some of the employees need to pay better attention to customers. I was with my mom and there were 4 girls behind the register one of them checked my mom out and I waited figuring she'd just get me to next not a huge deal. Instead she went back to talking to all the other employees ignoring the fact I needed to check out too and I had to ask to be checked out. Not great customer service. 

Other than that everything was great thought it was easy to find what we needed and the store is clean and organized."
__label__1	I ordered two sausage and cheese croissants. They DO NOT! Come with eggs...  I get my pickup order home to find out they gave me egg and sausage -.- no cheese. I don't eat eggs. This is the second time I've never there that they've messed up my order. Last time I figured I'd give them another try... I think it's safe to say I'm done with Kneaders
__label__5	Upon entering the Little Greek restaurant the music was enjoyable and the establishment was very clean. The owner and his daughter were attentive and very kind. The food was fresh and delicious. I would recommend everyone to come try this delightful experience.
__label__1	Do not go to To this pharmacy . the pharmacy techs are the worst. They are rude, very unhelpful, they do not know what they are going there. Stay away! The worst pharmacy I have been to ever.
__label__3	"Food was cold, order was wrong and I found a rotten tomato in the rice. So yeah....
Other than that they have a great menu and great drink selection. I'll try again."
__label__5	We stopped there on Sunday at 2:45. Only to be told that, sorry, well be closing in 15 minutes so you can not dine in. That is a terrible way to do business as I guess the lady was not the owner. 2 Sunday's previous we went there for lunch out of curiosity an I will have to say that the food is fantastic and the service is awesome! Just the turning away business is very bad for business! And the restaurant is not in a gas station but an old IHOP!
__label__4	The patio is SO AMAZING!! I spent most of my summer there. Most of the bartenders are nice but there is one male there that is NOT nice or friendly at all. He's actually pretty rude to be honest. I do wish they had more than one bathroom and maybe food. Overall great bar.
__label__5	Been coming to Los Arroyos from LA to Camarillo for years until it was closed ! Made the trip all the way to Santa Barbara not a bad drive , food was great and even got a discount for making the long trip , staff was friendly and service was great as always never get disappointed with Los Arroyos !
__label__3	They are understaffed so it took us 30 minutes to pick up our pre-ordered food. It's delicious but a bit over priced if you add anything to your tacos. I would love to be a frequent customer but it is too much of a hassle.
__label__5	Such a wonderful little brunch place if you're close by. My girlfriend and I look for such places and this was a gold mine! They had outdoor seating in such a cute little town off of Main Street. The service was amazing and the food was absolutely fantastic, especially the paninis. Word of advise if you are wise enough to try this place out, do not order chips if you're sitting outside.
__label__5	Let me start by saying we came all they way from Austin Texas & this place is awesome! When we arrived the place was BEYOND packed but we were able to get in very quick. The atmosphere was right the people were very friendly. The only thing  is the food did take a while to come out but is was WORTH the wait. We started off with Voodoo egg rolls. They were amazing.! Then I got the stuffed catfish Wow.! It came with shrimp past. The portions size was good.  Will come back when I'm in New Orleans
__label__5	Every single bite was just as amazing as the last. I had the jager schnitzel--schnitzel with a mushroom sauce, and I can't stop thinking about!!
__label__5	Needed my dress in time for my wedding. My precious semestres canceled on me less than a month before my wedding and I needed to find someone to fix my dress. I only had three months of wedding prep time so had to cramp up all planing in that time. Sharlee did an amazing job fixing my size 12 dress down to a size 4 dress. Wasn't aware of this when I bought the dress but she did great fixing it. Very happy!
__label__5	I got the nachos with shredded pulled pork. The shredded pulled pork was very tender and juicy. The chips were thin so they were easier to eat. The bbq sauce they put on it was a tad spicy. The restaurant had friendly/attentive staff. The building was well decorated and clean.
__label__2	Sushi was very very good but the service was far from it. We never got our drinks until after the food came and by then the hot tea was cold. Then we continue to wait for our salads while our waitress served other tables there she came in way later.   maybe it's just put their new and need to get the kinks our, they also need to hire more qualified servers.
__label__4	Food was good portions great. However the waitress did not write our order down (4 people at the table). Then came back to the table to clarify the order twice.
__label__5	My first time here & it was a neat place.  High ceilings, you can see the whole operation from the drinking area.  They have a big bar, lots of seating and games.  We sat on the couch by the fireplace and drank our flights.  We went close to closing time, but I would definitely go back again.  This is only a craft brewery l, you can bring your own food in.
__label__1	This business owner and his staff were extremely rude and disrespectful. They are scam artists that overcharge. They wanted to charge 300 dollars to put a new fan in my refrigerator, but when I declined they bullied and made my wife pay a portion of the charge even though no work was rendered. I put the $30 dollar part in myself after booting them out of my house. Would never recommend.
__label__4	"New place in Gulfport.  We sat outside on a cloudy rainless afternoon. For a while we were the only ones enjoying a lazy afternoon.

We started with chips and salsa. They were seasoned chips and a lime accented salsa. 

I had a braised beef taco while the hubby had the black bean and corn taco. They were topped with cotija, pickled onions, radish slices and crema. They were delicious!!!!

We'll be back!"
__label__5	I love this club! They book the best names and I lost my purse one time and security was so persistent about helping me find it. It ended up being in the lost and found immediately! What great service. The vibes were great and the drinks were on point. Best club in SB hands down!
__label__3	"The first time EVER, I have had to pull off to the side to wait to get my food, at a Wendy's establishment. Out of any ""fast food"" restaurant, I've always said that Wendy's had the best service. They asked me for change because they currently didn't have any either... Very strange..."
__label__2	Pizza was a C. Salad was very sad and limp, I give that a D. Haven't had desert yet. Will not order from here again. Waste of money.Delivery was a mess but that's because, for some reason, my address in Cherry Hill, NJ isn't located on a Google maps.
__label__5	First things first, I didn't go inside the church. I went to see the Tomb of the Unknown Slave. It seems important that, in a city full of historic cemetaries, that we spend some time considering the thousands of people who weren't given the option to be buried in those places.
__label__5	I love the Chicken Soup.  It is the best. Taco salad is good here too.  I have been here many times and have always had great service.  One of the best affordable Mexican food I have had.
__label__5	Came in because the place where I've gone before was closed for all 3 of my available shopping days, really glad I did. Ed went above and beyond, giving me a great deal on 3 beds, and then, made sure they were delivered that night, working late, almost 2 hours after store closed. Can't get that kind of service out of the chain stores, another reason to shop local. Thank you
__label__4	Love this place for the music and drinks! They have fun outside bar that has heater for chilly nights.
__label__2	When I was living in the Affton area, I attempted to try this pizza as it was well recommended by several friends. I was sorely disappointed. After waiting over an hour for delivery service, the pizza came. It was extremely cold, in addition to be the nastiest tasting pizza ever.  I decided to call the company back to voice a complaint, but received some nasty feedback from the management at this restaurant. Sorry, I won't be a patron of this establishment. Terrible pizza combined with the worst service.
__label__4	Some of my favorite donuts in the city!! The sugary twisted ones are my favorite and the chocolate dipped are my second favorite! Go early in the morning and get them when they're warm!! The cannolis are good too!
__label__3	A decent choice if you're in the FQ and your options are limited... I do like the fact that they offer Gumbo Z'Herbes, which isn't easily found nowadays. Their gumbos are pretty mediocre though, to tell the truth. A basic, average place.
__label__5	"***The place for donuts in Tucson.*** 

If there were a Krispy Kreme in town, I'd still go by Wheel Donuts every once in a while--and that's saying quite a lot.  ;-)     It tastes like they pour melted cake frosting on the donuts."
__label__1	"Although they have some good prices for us occasional smokers, their follow up on their advertisements leave a lot to be desired. I've ordered from them 5 times in the past 18 months and it's always the same. 10% discount on your next order. Then I get, ""your order doesn't qualify!"" Really? The last 3 orders I signed up for the military discount and didn't get that one either! I'm fed up with these guys... I'll just go to the convenience store or local smoke shop from now on. I'm done...."
__label__1	"I have had my second bad experience and will not be ordering from them again. I was told 45 minutes for my order and at 1.5 hours and 2 phone calls later I directly asked for a manager or someone to make this poor customer service experience right but was only told ""you want food?"" and the driver would be 2-3 minutes."
__label__4	Went here with business associates and we split all the dishes.   Our waiter made great recommendations and we generally followed them.    He and the staff were very attentive.     I never thought I liked collard greens, but here they were delicious.     There was a braised lamb pasta dish that was also very good.    We had two different preparations of drum, both excellent.    The restraunt is louder than I like,  Otherwise pretty good and definately food you will not have elsewhere.
__label__4	Really nice place. It's not too loud to have a conversation in. This is the bar where I overcame my karaoke stagefright for the first time. Staff is friendly. The receipts say I'll get a gift if I yelp about my server, so I was at the bar on New Year's day and Susi took care of me. She was very polite and attentive.
__label__5	The Parmesan truffle fries with the balsamic ketchup, is amazing! along with their craft cocktail menu, and extensive beers on tap. this place is amazing. along with friendly, great service! Nick, at the bar is a great bartender super friendly and attentive!
__label__4	Great hot chicken. Had myself a pitcher of Southern wit all to myself! Great place! Great service! Nice patio. AC inside feels nice during the day.
__label__1	this location, after 5 visits, still sucks. The bar is great, the food & staff, like sheep lead into the cliff, no one gives u an honest answer
__label__5	One of the few classier places on Bourbon and great for daytime cocktails outside with live music.
__label__5	Amazingly fresh salad, avocado melt is uniquely delicious, and staff was extremely efficient and friendly. Dining area is clean and cozy.
__label__5	Absolutely fantastic!!! It was a pleasure to deal with this company. Very professional and good bedside manners. I am so blown away by how great my carpet looks, and it was done in less than an hour. I have no need to search for anyone else. This will be my go-to guys from now on.
__label__1	This airport is filthy. The layout is difficult, and the staff are unfriendly. I would prefer to not fly out of this airport again.
__label__5	Delicious lunches every visit.  This place looks and feels great.  You cannot get a better meal than one served here.  Gary is such a talented chef and is always creative with his meals. The baked pies are wonderful.  Best lunch spot in the county!
__label__5	This is my number one go-to quick and easy place for pizza carry out on the east side. Prices are reasonable, pizza is always hot and fresh, and they have great service. I know they have a new delivery service that they have been using, but I have not used it. I highly recommend this place. Give them a shot!
__label__5	Best ever restaurant in Broad Ripple. Excellent beer selections and the food special were outstanding! Our server Derek was awesome!
__label__4	Consistently flavorful food you can count on. Really recommend the rellano. Certainly American/Mexican food....yet there is a separation of flavors not all bean and cheesy melted messes....can taste quality ingredients. Service is friendly and efficient...atmosphere, typical.
__label__5	Tender, juicy, and teeming with FLAVOR. I could not get enough. It was my first time having Birria tacos and I literally have not stopped craving it since! Hands down BEST BIRRIA TACO JOINT IN STLOUIS!
__label__1	$150 a night and no complimentary toothbrushes on your wedding night? Mentioned it's our wedding night and didn't care. Better experience at the Vacasa.
__label__1	"WOW! First of all, I ordered my pizza and my order Tim was pushed way back because they gave my order to someone else (I ordered in door dash). Then when I tried to call the restaurant to see what happened with my order (because it took 30 minutes past the original deliver time) I kept getting left in voicemail and when the rude girl finally answered the phone, she literally would not let me speak and said ""were busy""! Absolutely terrible customer service and would not recommend this place to anyone :( also some friendlier staff would be appreciated"
__label__5	This place is awesome they have great promotions all the time and the owner Mike seems like a great guy who goes out of his way to make sure the customer is taken care of.  There's a nice variety of frozen yogurt to choose from as well as milkshakes and smoothies.  Nice set up with plenty of seating and a few televisions and location is in a large strip mall so parking is never a problem.
__label__5	My friend and I came to Billy G's tonight. We had heard it was a new Giannino family restaurant. It was beautifully remodeled, great service, 40 Min. wait on friday night. A great place to enjoy with friends.  A delicious pulled pork sandwich, baked beans, cole slaw, sweet potato fries and desert from Blue Owl. It was a wonderful experience. I will spread the word. Thank you Billy G. MJ
__label__1	The boba tea is disgusting. It ruined the taste of my ice cream. The boba was chewy. Would never get it again or recommend it to anyone.
__label__4	Friendly place to grab a beer & some food. The Stromboli, salads & chicken fingers are amazing. If you try one thing here it has to be the Stromboli!
__label__1	What people say about the service is true. You can't have people like this interfacing with potential customers. It's like I'm somehow burdening you by contacting you for business. This is a huge detriment to the store that will eventually cause it to close. Whatever girl is answering your phones on Thursday nights 9:30pm 3/11/21 is costing you everything. She's single handedly driving your business into the ground.
__label__5	Once you've had five guys, it's hard to go back to fast food options like McDonald's or Burger King. The level of quality and taste is just so much better at Five Guys. Love this place!
__label__5	This is probably one of my favorite burgers I have had since moving to St. Louis! The burger was SO good and I loved the fries! I got my burger with a fried egg on top and was so excited when it came out that the yolk was runny, because I don't like when the yolk isn't. Even though there was a wait to order, it went by quickly and the food came out really fast! I will definitely be coming back here again to try other options!
__label__4	Arrive 10am on a Saturday... line out the door!  However, the service was very quick and turnover and the tables was quick so we were even able to sit down.  I had the basic breakfast bagel... nothing too entirely special, but it was tasty.  I would go back again for sure, but it's not going to be a regular stop for me.
__label__1	"$23.00 for a large pizza with half pepperoni!  What a joke.  

Pizza is below average, service stinks, this place won't last long."
__label__4	Love the food, and since it gets super busy at times, lots of other people do. We go hours that usually let us avoid the rush. Nice staff, comfortable atmosphere. My only complaint is the bathroom, which could use a bit more love due to the crowds.
__label__5	Great deals. Nick, Gunther, and Phil always provide fantastic customer service. I love giving business to a local shop like this.
__label__3	Solid beer stop, prices are high but hey it's a 6 pack shop. They also sell cases and singles and here is what rocks... They fill growlers! They have a little tap bar in the back left. The bar tenders know their stuff and are very helpful.
__label__5	I have been going here for years and always had a positive experience.  They handled the insurance for my contacts and glasses.  No complaints!
__label__4	Was craving sides. Ordered Mac & cheese, candied yams, plantains, and garlic green beans. No pictures because I devoured everything so fast. Everything was great but DAMN those garlic green beans may have been the best I've ever had! Only reason I give them 4 instead of 5 is the delivery took 1.5hrs since the time of ordering. Like I said, I was craving sides, and I gotta say the wait was worth it. Can't wait to order jerk chicken and more Jamaican food in the near future!
__label__5	"They take covid seriously. Their new menu is via a QRC CODE which is easy, point your camera and most pick it up right away. Servers wear masks and the table are cleaned throughly before the next customer. 
Food was delicious! Thanks for keeping people safe!"
__label__4	Went for lunch. Lunch bowl are large. Lamb Broth was delicious. The bowls get delivered on a monorail via conveyor belt to match their Train theme.
__label__5	We enjoyed this place! The phö, Wings, spring rolls, and sandwiches were good! The staff is amazing!
__label__4	Excellent breakfast at great prices! The specials are phenomenal deals. Don't miss out on the pancakes made from scratch! My two year old could not get enough of them.
__label__5	Came here for about 1 1/2 years. Absolutely loved the classes, sweating and pushing myself. Definitely therapeutic!! Wish my schedule would of kept working out to come at the times the classes are offered. Hopefully I'll be able to come back! I've tried boxing classes at Escape and these are way better! Linda is fabulous!!
__label__3	Good casual food, pretty big portions. It's a popular place, so be prepared for a bit of a wait.
__label__3	Pizza was good, wings were tasty, restaurant clean, cashier slow! Games were horrible, almost half were not working! Selection of games poor! Only one person on floor trying to maintain games! Young man working prizes was awesome with kids! Needs improvement before we return we'll drive extra miles so kids can enjoy playing on games that work!
__label__4	I love the self-order and self-pay, and service is quick. I've gotten poke twice to go from here and loved it both times. They do tend to over stuff the cups with the base you order (like, way overkill on spring mix or overkill on rice), but I bet if you just put in a comment on your order to chill on some ingredients they'd do so.
__label__4	I thought parking was over priced, and our rooms had windows but they were opaque! I was looking forward to a view of the city. Other than that, I don't have any other complaints!
__label__5	Great breakfast sandwiches on fresh bagels. Lots of options for bagels as well as muffins. Everything was excellent.
__label__4	"My husbands shrimp and grits were awesome!!! I had the crab cake dish, don't order that! Staff was very nice and attentive. I'll go back 
to try something else."
__label__5	"this place IS so great the best mexican food in south philly, authentic, cheap, and the salsa is BANGIN!


HIGHLY RECCOMENDED!"
__label__4	One of my favorite place to grab lunch or dinner with family and friends. We beat the busy crowd on Sunday by making it here by 10am. Food are a little over priced but yummy. My favorite item on the menu are the lemon grass chicken with com nep(fried round shapes rice) and an avacodo drink. Today food were on point but the service were not great. They must had new workers because we had to ask for our plates, lids for drinks and napkins that we asked since we all sharing our food. Over we were very satisfied with our food.
__label__5	Doylestown rock climbing place rules! Casual dress style is required. Been going here for 10 years, and loved it. NBC 10 runs the 2012 Summer Olympics in 5 minutes. But anyway, the gym has lots of equipment and good rocks thingy. Love the rock gym and hope you do too!!!!!
__label__1	Nobody likes being towed. No one appears to know what's going on and it took about an hour in the heat to finally get my car with only one other person there. Cash only.
__label__5	Delicious, refreshing interesting drinks, same for the food. I adore the staff and the food! Chicken salad always amazing. They use local veggies and you can taste the difference!
__label__1	Just had a horrible experience going for a job interview here, I'm so glad I was lucky enough to move on. DO NOT APPLY TO WORK HERE!!
__label__1	This store has terrible range and do not provide a WiFi to the customers! Trying communicate with my spouse what we should get. I have been coming here several times and frustrate increasingly every time I come here!
__label__5	Dr. Forniss and her staff are great! My daughter needed glasses recently and her experience there was excellent.  She was able to find nice frames for an 8 year old that were just perfect.  I recently took my prescription there and found me some replacement frames. Love them and I will continue to go there for my family's optical needs!
__label__5	This place is hands down, the BEST!! The most perfect sandwich you'll ever eat in your life!! If you haven't been here..GO.. Run!!
__label__1	I ordered 2 medium pizzas and some wings. Most disgusting pizza i have ever had. It was just dark and the mozzarella cheese hadn't melted yet.  The guy who delivered it took over an hour, and we only live 2 blocks from the pub. My husband was on the phone with him for over 35 minutes.  Never again.
__label__5	The lines are long, it is pricey, but the drinks are damn good and it's a New Orleans classic. I'd recommend going at an off time and not during Mardi Gras if you can so you can experience it in its entirety.
__label__5	Great spot! Really nice staff. Selection is mostly rock and jazz, and I found some great soul and international records. Price is pretty good for the quality of used records and priced better than what I'm used to in NYC. Didn't have time to check out the $3 bins.
__label__2	Very disappointing.  We went there for our anniversary and left early.  We were not impressed with anything we ordered.  Very mundane:( . We left and went to re-eat dinner for half the price and enjoyed it a lot more.
__label__3	Brunch is brunch, with a French swag.  You can save your money for a more tasty experience or if you want to have the Instagram photos, then feel free to eat outside w a glass of wine and sunglasses.
__label__5	Food was incredibly good! The service was quick and friendly. Easy to walk up, get your delicious indian street food and they even have limited outdoor dining spots to sit and eat in the age of COVID. The rolls are like little burritos of your favorite Indian dishes...... amazing. Make sure you try the sauces too! They were priced so that you can buy a few as one won't fill up an adult with a hearty appetite. I will be back whenever I am in the area.
__label__5	This is the second time I've been to Reno Nevada but neglected to visit this awesome bar. The atmosphere is classic with an abundance of seating and pool tables with a fantastic selection of drafts, liquor and food. The staff is superb, constantly looking to make sure I was doing ok. Needless to say anytime I come back into town to visit I will be sure to spend my money here. The only caveat is they should have an awesome breakfast menu to pair with their sensational lunch & dinner menu.
__label__5	Wonderful place for my boyfriend to stay looking fresh and clean. I love the way Stacy cuts his hair!
__label__5	"Awesome place
Great food of all kinds
Fun and nice bartenders

The gumbo was awesome 
I suggest if you are with friends order different things from several vendors and share"
__label__5	Delicious.  Did this on the strength of yelp ratings.  Dropped in to get out of traffic.  Excellent.  Will come back and get the beef next time!  Had chick schwarma with hummus and tabouli.  Pickled Turnips beautiful.
__label__5	This place is so good. The poke was fresh and there's so many options to choose from! I got the cauliflower base and half salmon half tuna. Topped it with ample toppings they offer and some yummy sauces! Great heathy lunch option or dinner too. You can also get proteins that aren't fish as they now offer chicken and steak. Or go full veggie!
__label__4	"We were a party of six and found this through opentable.com. I love the atmosphere and design of the restaurant. The wait staff was excellent and very attentive. Amongst us we had a variety of food. My trout was delicious. Two people got the pork shank, it was good but a little too fatty. Bacon wrapped scallops were also very good. Charcuterie and cheese board were very good. 
I would recommend this restaurant especially if you want to get away from all the BBQ type places that are around town."
__label__5	We are SO HAPPY we no longer have to drive to FK down in South Tampa. I have never had a bad meal at a FK. Today we got a four bowl and a six bowl. The decor in the inside is so adorable. The utensil dispensers are great, you just grab the stem of the utensil so there minimal contact from other people. There is seating inside and outside. FYI there is seating outside on the side of the building in case there is nothing out front. We will now be adding this FK to our rotation list!
__label__5	"This is the best bike shop in the city. I have had everything from bike emergencies on the way to work, to just a basic question and every visit is short and sweet. Everything you need and nothing you don't. All the employees are friendly and knowledgeable and will direct you to a superior product for less money. 

Also great rentals when you have friends in town."
__label__5	"I have always wanted to eat here since I have heard so many rave reviews and now that I did I can't stop raving about it myself!  I met a friend for dinner during restaurant week and I have no complaints at all.  The food, service, and atmosphere were all outstanding! 

Our first course was gazpacho.  Definitely the best I have ever had! Then we had vaca frita.  The steak was so tender and tasty and the rice and beans complemented the sea.  For desert, I had carrot cake which was a great choice!

I highly recommend checking this place out!"
__label__4	"came here for lunch and was pleasantly suprised.  The tacos were delicious (I had the tuna and the duck) very unusual combos...but very yummy.  For lunch I though it was decently priced.  

I would like to check it out in the evening.  The bar menu seemed quite nice.  

I will mention the eye candy there wasn't bad either :)  Very attractive waitstaff...yeah, kinda pushy...but not obnoxious!"
__label__1	"DO NOT USE. sales guy assured no problems, however with 6 loads on the truck you are guaranteed to be missing items and forget about collecting on your claim. They don't want to know. They say it's not their problem because not one of the 5 other deliveries claimed they got anything extra. They are truthful but you, the claimant, are not.
I got $42 on a $500 claim. Find another mover!!!!"
__label__5	Traveling and needed a quick adjustment before getting back on the road. Walked in and was adjusted 10 minutes later. Paula provided just what I needed without the fluff. She'll be my first consideration if back in this area.
__label__3	The food tastes good meat kinda dry but not good For the price. If you like five guys it tastes similar but five guys def tastes better and has cheaper prices and shorter wait times.
__label__2	This Visionworks is only about a month old, and were having trouble operating when we went to pick up a pair of glasses. The wait, in terms of days, was very long to receive the glasses. The choices at this location (and the location on Fletcher had the same exact choices) were not that nice or stylish, esp for the prices. They need more higher end brands. The people working at both locations were pleasant, but we will not be back to this chain for glasses again.
__label__2	Honestly, this place is just really inconsistent. I used to love their food but its really bland anymore. I ordered the Mac and it was basically just dry pasta. I feel like the chefs or management are not on the same page. I hope they go back to what they used to be.
__label__4	Great after work specials. Great food for example, their Kolbe burger and a side of 4 cheese Mac and cheese. Heaven with a glass of sav blanc.
__label__1	Ryan had the worst attitude and was very rude and disrespectful. Non helpful and to he tells me in the end don't care how you feel I can find a job anywhere, really wish I was not in the contract to go to another carrier. Totally not helpful and very rude attitude, the worst store don't go there
__label__5	I had an amazing reading with Joanne a couple of days ago. I am still astonished at the accuracy she had with details that no one would know. But this was not a reading full of predictions, this was a profound life coaching type of reading, where the advice and guidance that she gave me was information that I so needed and will follow. Joanne is loving, insightful, funny and a genuine caring woman! I highly recommend a session with Joanne.
__label__1	The owner is very rude and didn't do anything close to what I asked for. Then charged a ridiculous amount for something I could have easily gotten for $100 less elsewhere. It wouldn't even bother me to pay it but at least listen to what I ask for. Also the woman shampooing, very sweet but omg I thought my scalp was going to bleed with how rough she was. It was actually painful. Thankfully I've found another stylist who is so sweet and kills it every time.
__label__3	"Good but not great.  The ciopinno was solid and the service was great.  Bloody Mary and the wine list were also strong.  A great place for small kids because they are drowned out by the open kitchen. 

The garlic clams were breadier than I expected.

Skip the mild flavored clam chowder and bread basket."
__label__5	Wonderful food and service! A really great menu and the best of very few upscale restaurants in Carpinteria!
__label__1	THIS JACK IN THE BOX IS HORRIBLE. The guy that took our order was extremely rude. Definitely shouldn't be working in customer service. We ordered pancakes and then got to the window and was told they were out of syrup. Was asked to pull around to wait for our food. Waited 20 minutes, they brought our food out and the order was wrong. HORRIBLE. This jack should be shut down. Ridiculous
__label__5	"Great Great Great
I had the Tour of Italy.....awesome.

And the service was great, always have a great experience when visiting Olive Garden."
__label__1	True N Y pizza owners are truly bad . I called an order of 2 pizza pies the brother in law quoted me around 30 dollars when the pizzas got delivered the bill was over 40 dollars. I called to make sure of the price and was told to return the pizzas. I contacted the store to make sure my credit card was refunded I was told by the owner's wife not to call again.
__label__3	They were very generous with samples to help me figure out what I would like.  Just wish that the sample glasses didn't taste/smell like dish washing chemicals.  They have a long and varying list of beers, something for everyone, as they say.  Food was fine.  It was a nice sized operation, not too big (read corporate) or too small (limited variety and/or quality).
__label__4	The portions here match the price but the food is excellent! I got the flatbread with tomato's and pesto it was very good, my son enjoyed his grilled cheese and I ate his fruit they served because it was sweet and delicious. The only reason I can't give the extra star is because the staff is kinda of rude if you're not dressed elegant or fancy I should say. I walked in for lunch with causal clothing and was not given as much attention than the couple dressed on a date. Please don't judge a book by its cover.
__label__5	I'm vegan so it was a few options for me. My husband had curry goat , beans and rice, cabbage and plantains. He is from the islands and was very  pleased. Staff was friendly, professional and welcoming. I believe it was the owner even gave my husband some chicken to try. Prices was reasonable, food tasted authentic, restaurant was clean, and a staff looked clean.  The cashier  was able to answer all my vegan questions and concerns. I would recommend this for anyone passing through like us. And I can't see how locals don't come a few times a week.
__label__4	I went to Cactus Creek for a third time several weeks ago, and the food was excellent. The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because of the horrid cigarette smoke wafting through the restaurant. Top notch food. I went with the New York instead of the ribeye this time because I wanted to try something a little leaner, and new. Next time I am going all out for the porterhouse. I love the food here.
__label__4	In my opinion Jim's Steaks are among the best Cheese-Steaks in Philadelphia.  One of the best parts of this place is that it is indoor seating which is good when the weather is cold because that seems to allow the cheese to melt into the meat better.
__label__1	Went here last night with my kids.  Not crowded at all.  Took several minutes for a host to even acknowledge us.  After he sat us, it took 10 minutes for someone to take our drink order.  It took another 10 minutes to get my wine and a water.  Server was awful.  I had to go up to the counter to get boats and napkins.  My son's GF had to go up to counter to get refills on our drinks.  WORST SERVICE EVER.  Food under average.  You all better get some workers in there or you will be out of biz by Christmas.
__label__5	Best Reuben I've ever had.  Fast, professional service and located in the heart of the Central West End.  Just wish they were open 7 days a week!
__label__1	"Checkin in was almost as slow as the elevators. The staff is disinterested in any concerns you may have. The place was out dated, smelly, and not up to code. The phone didn't work I. My room, coffee maker was useable, and there was only 1 towel. The stairwell exists appear to be a real safety hazard. If there were ever a fire not many people would make it out of the building. The free breakfast consisted of boxed eggs, toast and muffins. Worst hotel I've ever stayed at. 
I would not recommend to anyone."
__label__5	This place rules. No frills menu, and it's done right! Root beer and mini sliders are the way to go.
__label__1	Food was ok yet the small of rotten food was repulsive. I could not finish my food. We had to leave. Staff was friendly and it looked clean.
__label__1	"Worst stores in the valley, all of them are filthy, poorly stocked and gross. Then there is this ""Ruby"" person who thinks everything is valuable, ridiculous prices for donated junk!!!"
__label__5	A group of us went to The Harvest Room at the Fairmont Hotel Macdonald for dinner and enjoyed the ambiance and the view of the river valley.  The waitstaff were prompt and attentive and the service time was well within reason.  The quality of the food that we order was excellent and each of us enjoyed what we ordered immensely.  We did not have any issues and everything met our expectations.  It was a great meal and a memorable experience.  Hope to come back again soon.
__label__3	I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs. It was good but nothing really out of this world. For me it was  bland, plus The portion was a little on the small side. I'm just used to the restaurants in Chicago and I have yet to find any comparable down here.
__label__5	Tour was great and your guide even better! They gave us a delicious drink in the beginning and a bunch of samples at the end! All were tasty. They have an awesome cocktail area for before or after the tour too and the drinks there were great as well! I recommend trying them after the tour though, since you will already have sampled all of their spirits and can choose a drink with your favorite!
__label__3	"3.5 stars.

I came here around 1 on Saturday night. A friend of mine who's familiar with the area said they closed at 3 which is better than the usual 1:30-2 last call at other places. There was no cover which made it better. The music was okay, and it was a nice change from the Olde City bars. For a Saturday night, it had a good amount of people. but wasn't packed. I would check this place out again next time I'm in the area."
__label__3	Wasn't impressed. Location was good, beds comfortable and felt safe ( which is probably most important).  Nothing special though. I didn't feel like the hotel was making an effort to make the stay personal. There really was no one greeting you or saying goodbye. Very different than other 4 star hotels. It was okay, but no difference than a 3 star for me. For example, there were no complimentary drinks in the lobby or rooms like other hotels. No water even. At least i didn't see it.
__label__5	Dr Lala is the absolute BEST. My teeth were far from great but slowly and surely, Dr Lala is helping me achieve the smile of my dreams. Not to mention she is compassionate, kind, and pretty funny. The office is so cool, they even have TVs on the ceilings of the exam rooms! The staff is very friendly and compassionate. I literally make the trek fromPhilly to Horsham for anything with my teeth. Thank you Dr. Lala and thank you team!
__label__4	This is our go to place for pizza in the area. The pizza is surprisingly tasty, with crispy crust and good sauce. Sandwiches are good too, prices are reasonable and friendly service.
__label__1	"First, they sold me a plan that did not work with my phone.
So I changed both the plan and the phone. 
Second, they fried my old phone doing data transfer. The tech guy didn't even apologize !! I lost all data/photos/contacts/etc.
Third : though they assured me the first line got transferred and therefore didn't need to be canceled, they charged me for all lines..
Conclusion : find another option !!"
__label__1	"Unsanitary. Very dirty. Had old stuff on cups and silverware, server was horrible. 

The reviews speak for themselves, I mean they have so many. 

It's Benihana, it's a known place, didn't think I had to look at the reviews until now. I wish I did. I don't even need to write a review but I'm so disgusted."
__label__5	Thank you for making my eyebrows look amazing!!! Great service, she is very professional and will do a great job, best eyebrow service EVER and I can't wait to book with her for make-up
__label__1	"I wish I can give 0 stars!!  Just tried to go to lunch there today. They open at 10am and I went to the drive thru at 10:45. No one was answering the speaker so I parked and tried to go inside. The doors were locked. All the lights were on but there was no one inside. There's a big pink sign in the window saying ""Now Hiring"". Not sure what's going on but very disappointed!"
__label__5	I got Lindsay and she was so sweet and did an amazing job!! I showed her the hair I wanted with a picture and she did exactly what it looked like! Definitely would recommend coming here for a color, even if you're not from Boise!
__label__5	"Appetizer : Brie tartelette
Fantastic smoke baked and crusty - julienne apple. Fantastic   Finished with toasted hazelnuts sweet cmetelized onion 

Scallops were single sided seared only but heated through and properly served. 

Popover as always very good - new garlic butter recipe or at least very well executed

Overall great place to go."
__label__5	"Very nice little place! Authentic Mexican, very nice portions. The salsa that they serve with chips is excellent. Terrific prices!

 Been there several times, service is always great and never a bad meal."
__label__2	Food was not worth it, there are plenty of better places on Broadway. My ribs were tasteless and I wouldn't order meat there again based on the average-ness of everyone's plate. The only stand-out was the fried pickles appetizer--the best fried pickles I had in Nashville, they do the entire dill spear instead of the rounds. I would recommend you go for the music (it's loud so don't expect a conversation), a beer and the fried pickles.
__label__5	Good family owned place. Rick, Paul and Nancy are always so nice and helpful with whatever I need ! Bring all your cars here !
__label__4	Came here for happy hour with my husband and a friend. We enjoyed the raw oysters and also got the trio. My friend who doesn't like raw oysters liked the charbroiled trio. There was a woman who greeted us at the door and the waiting staff were extremely friendly. My husband ordered the sazarac and he really enjoyed it, it was strong! We would definitely return and recommend this place to a friend!
__label__4	Great place. Delicious pretzels. And they gave out coupons for free pretzels on St. Patrick's Day!
__label__3	Great Salad Bar, Had the salmon & wasnt very impressed at all.
__label__4	"We have been here a few times now.

Each time the wait person is nice and attentive.

The food is good as well, this trip I had the mushroom burger being huge to the point of not being able to finish it. I ordered it medium rare and it actually came out perfectly cooked along with some very nice onion rings.

I do like the interior of the place, it fits the area."
__label__1	i used to go to this place and see the owner Danny who was great. I went on sunday and Eric the new owner did my acrylic nails. They are lumpy looking and look terrible. Today is Tuesday and three have ALREADY fallen off.  Not going back.
__label__1	I found this dentist through Groupon. After x-rays and cleaning, I was told that I needed 13 fillings and a crown, totaling over $4,300 (after their in-office discount plan). I got a second opinion who told me: 0 cavities and no crown - just possibly replace a filling in the near future. Would avoid at all costs.
__label__1	Food wasn't too bad.   Service was horrible.  Being in the Bourbon Lounge, they first said they couldn't make a Bloody Mary.  Then one said they could.  I finally got one.     It was rare to see a server.  They even forgot to put my order in to the kitchen for food.  Very upsetting.    Of course; tip reflected the horrible service we got.
__label__5	best fish fry and love the little corn  nuggets of goodness!   I could eat this everyday.   highly recommend coming here.  Forgot to mention soft serve cones for dessert and they have the best carrot cake! And chocolate cake, lemon cake, strawberry cake, and pies.
__label__5	Went back on this trip just as good as the first! My wife got the banana foster for the second time and the kids loved the double chocolate chip pancakes.
__label__5	Love! parking is horrendous due to location and popularity, but by far the most unique taco experience I've had. Avocado tacos - who knew?
__label__4	Filthy, fun, loud, crazy..what else would you expect. I'd go again though, because it's so historic and cool :)
__label__5	If you want a good reliable moving company, Nicolosi IS the right move. An honest job at a fair price. Highly recommend!
__label__3	"Animal friendly!

Lots of clothing, but does not take household items anymore."
__label__2	It looks good but is really a fitness chuckie cheese. Kids were swarming around the front desk shake bar. Their parents were just chatting like it's a bar also. Many shreks (typical slightly overweight crew cut men) just stood on treadmills talking while wearing a lot of cologne. I just want to run and lift and not have a mall experience.
__label__1	"Okay, where do I start.  Had a party of 4.
2  had ordered a simple breakfast dish,  Chicken & Waffles, Pancakes &  bacon. 
The other 2 ordered, Biscuits and gravy with Country Ham,  Breakfast Scramble Bowl.  TERRIBLY SALTY!!!
I will just say this, The food was HORRIBLE, 3 out of the 4 dishes COULD NOT ENJOYED!!!

**THEY MIGHT want to THINK ABOUT RENAMING the RESTAURANT.**"
__label__5	YUM!  Went with a group & tried a little bit of everything.  Definite favorites - the roast pork, the eggplant/tomato/mozz & the meatballs.  Everything was really well-seasoned & tasty.  Fries were amazing.  I'm already looking forward to the next time I can eat here!
__label__5	I've always had a great experience at Yard House! Good food, drinks, and prices. I once had a server that was new and seemed a bit too worried about keeping her job and apologized every 2 seconds, but otherwise I've never had a bad meal.
__label__2	Couldn't find anywhere for customer feedback on the website or app, so I came here to complain. I've had food from this restaurant several times before and it was always good and fresh but today was a different story. I ordered the Spicy Thai salad. More than half of the romaine lettuce in my salad was old and a few pieces looked rotten. Some of it looked like it had been previously frozen. Everything else in the salad tasted good once I picked it out!
__label__4	Very Good Italian Food. Service was very good.  Fresh Garlic Bread was good. We had the Spaghetti Bolognese and String Linguini.    And  First time I tried their Brown Rice Fusilli Pasta. Im a fan since I cant eat regular Pasta.
__label__4	"This little park is tucked away a few turns off of Rancho Vistoso, but has plenty  for everyone...even fido ;) The park has plenty of shade trees and also offers a playground, restrooms, tennis, volleyball, and basketball courts as well as an enclosed grassy dog park. No need to park on the street since this park has a parking lot plenty big for everyone!
Just a sidenote...the park is not located at the ""Bougainvillea"" address but is actually off of West Desert Fairways :)"
__label__5	Had brunch here for the first time today, it was pretty great. Had a wonderful Carmel cold brew with almond milk and a garden frittata with a side of scrapple. My boyfriend had the cinnamon bun pancakes and sausage. Food was pretty decent. Our server Lexi was super sweet and accommodating. I have a dairy and gluten intolerance and she was awesome at making sure my meal didn't contain anything that would make me sick. She even offered have things made special for me. Would be back just for her.
__label__1	Who Gives napkins with the receipt and makes you put them in the bag? Only this Burger King. It's a bad idea, makes a mess and makes the customer take longer. Whomever had this genius idea needs to go back to Burger King Basic school. Or jump over to McDonalds and learn a couple things from them 1st.
__label__5	Beer and video games. What more could you want? Games are set to free play except for pin ball. Will be back.
__label__3	Went therer to listen to a band.  The service was terrible.  We didn't have s menu, utensils, napkins.  We ordered and our food came cold.  It took a long time to get our food.  Ordered wine and they wanted to put it in a plastic cup.  Probably won't go again
__label__5	Nice clean store and friendly staff. Incredible free Christmas light display every year.
__label__1	Had the worst experience on Friday morning. I had three free items on the am pm app, I went into this am pm to redeem them, the cashier wouldn't take my phone to scan them he pointed to the scanner, I scanned it and went to pull up the next one and the cashier said it didn't take and then started to call me a liar, then he proceeded to tel me to go f myself. I always go to this one but no longer again
__label__5	I visit the location on Little Chicago Road in Noblesville. The staff are very friendly and I'm very happy with their services. They were able to remove dried slime from my daughter's dress! It looks like new. Thank you!!
__label__4	Great music and 25% discounts for vets. Gets a little too crowded at times but overall a great place. Bartenders are honest unlike another bartender on Fri and Sat nights 4 blocks south of here
__label__4	Great variety of food - had the Carolina pork bbq (5/5) and General tsos cauliflower with Shrimp (5/5). Food was excellent but this place is in a strip mall so outdoor patio view (parking lot) is the only reason we are giving it 4 out of 5 stars
__label__5	While waiting for my table, I visited the bar. A young gentleman named Michael was there, my husband asked what his specialty was. I am a whiskey kind of lady so he made us two Whiskey Old Fashioneds and let me tell you, It was the best I have ever had. I made sure he made my drinks rhe rest of the night. The food and service was just as good. Drinks always rate higher with me :)
__label__3	Decent food, great pies, but spotty service. We usually go on holidays and the Brandon location has better service than big bend. On our most recent visit, our server was nice and food came out quickly. However, she dropped off the check, disappeared and never asked us if we wanted dessert. Twenty minutes later, we gave up, walked up front and had the cashier add on the pies to the bill, along with a small tip.  If we could've located our server, she would've gotten a large cash tip. Her loss on a holiday.
__label__3	I have had the turkey burger, veggie burger, and pretzels off the food menu. All of there were pretty good. I really like stopping here on a Friday afternoon for happy hour and enjoying drink specials on the sidewalk and watching the people and dogs walk by. It's a fun part of the neighborhood and the vodka bar is an interesting place to see it happening. The bar  is iced over to keep your drinks cold and the house vodkas are always changing to give you new flavors to try.
__label__4	"Made reservations for brunch on line on ""Open Table"" which was a good idea because although there are quite a few tables the place is extremely popular. The atmosphere and decor is electric and classy.
The Bloody Mary was the perfect start to a delicious meal.
I ordered the OE Eggs Benedict which a new twist on a Benedict. It had crispy bacon, tomato and was on a perfect biscuit. 
Tables around us all ordered the crispy Brussel sprouts which looked fantastic. Will try those next time, which will be very soon!
Service was very attentive and knowledgeable."
__label__2	On the surface, it has all the makings of a fabulous place.  In reality this place is disappointing.  On the menu, the creations seem like your going to have a party on your tastebuds but to be honest, the soft serve was tasteless and the toppings weren't anything special.  Save your $8 because you can get better soft serve at McDonalds or Costco for a lot cheaper.
__label__5	We visited here on our trip from North Carolina and were not disappointed!  The food was delicious!  I order Arroz con Pollo at every Mexican restaurant I go to and this was the best I have tasted!  Fried ice cream was yummy too!
__label__3	We have been coming to your restaurant for 6 years, lately we have noticed that the quality is not as good as it used to be, for example, I ordered a take out, beets and spinach salad and Chicken Parmigiana, the salad was missing the cheese and the chicken was over cooked, please keep an eye on the chefs in Blue Bell, they can do a much better job, my wife told me she didn't want to go your restaurant any more.
__label__4	What a great little cafe. We stopped in on a Saturday. I had a Cuban, my husband had a burger and fries. We had the bacon mac n cheese bombs for an appetizer. All delicious and you can tell it's home made. Our food came out in a timely manner. The place was very clean and the staff were super friendly. Can't wait to go back for breakfast and try their biscuits and gravy.
__label__4	The have a great variety of specialty rolls here. The Geisha and Samurai rolls are amazing. The basic rolls are well made with fresh and tasty ingredients and were just as enjoyable. I absolutely love their Red Bean Tempura ice cream. Seriously I crave that stuff way too often! A member of my group doesn't do sushi and was pleased with the chicken teriyaki bento box. I don't think you will be disappointed in this place.
__label__2	I got the sweet potato roll and was disappointed! Yanako is run by the same chef as Chaaba Thai in Manayunk and both the places have great reviews so I had to try it! The sweet potato roll just tasted off and weird! The rice used for the roll didn't even taste like sticky rice! The price is ok but the food was meh would not be coming back!
__label__5	Our food was great, and our server, alyssa, was even better. A rather rowdy group was crowding our table early outside on a Saturday. The people that she politely asked to just grab a table and stop standing by us got extremely rude and combative. she handled  them with class and grace and apologized profusely for their behavior.
__label__5	Came in and was welcomed in like a local. The place is very small. Only 6 stools but thats fine because the sandwiches we shared (paesano/arista) were some of the best sandwiches I ever had. The paesano was definitely he winner. The roasted tomato and egg really put the paesano on the top. A must visit if you are in that area of Philly.
__label__2	"In response to the owner's claims that prices are unusually high due to using handcrafted locally sourced organic ingredients, I'd like to point out that my $8 Paloma ""craft cocktail"" was a Grapefruit Jarritos soda bottle with some tequila added, a lime wedge and a salted bottle neck. I've posted a picture for reference. Perhaps the salt and lime were locally sourced and organic? Does buying the Jarritos at a local store count?"
__label__1	Smelled like weed and closed 2 hrs early. Night manager needs to be fired. Employees Wasn't the most friendly way when I pulled up in the drive thru.
__label__5	Received a few gift certificates here and fell in love. Tried some closer to home but Jose Lucena makes it worth the drive. He really listens to your concerns and understands what to work on to make you feel relaxed. Jose is very professional and I highly recommend his services!!
__label__2	"Quite disappointed by the experience for a place that creates such an upscale feel. The view was amazing but give that credit to the architects of MO/IL, fall colors and that muddy Mississippi. Service was not what I expect -- below expectations and the pepper steak was smothered with nearly whole peppercorns. 

I'd rather order off the grill than this place!"
__label__1	Price is misleading. The prices posted are not what they charge. It's like 10% more then they add tax on top. I hate it when businesses do this.
__label__5	Made alittle trip to Tampa yesterday to try this place out, and let's just say it was well worth it out of all the donut shops I been to this is one of the best ones, they have a big variety of unique toppings plus u can customize your own, customer service was amazing as well owner went up and beyond to make sure we were happy, most defiantly going back real soon!
__label__5	Amazing creole food! Our favorite find in Franklin so far. We're addicted to the etouffee and garlic bread. This place is worth it's 5 star rating.
__label__1	"After reading the other comments here. I'm not surprised at all. Rather I'm glad that its not just me who felt so about this place.

This place has the worst costumer service. I had gone for an oil change which usually takes 10-15 minutes. With over an hour before closing time he denied me service for no good reason and that too in the rudest way possible. Never going back here again."
__label__5	Francesco's has the best food in town! Their pizza is second to none.
__label__4	Very quaint tucked away place in the French quarter.  Great ambience.  Just had a breakfast sandwich (ham, egg, cheese, and tomatoes on sourdough).  Simple but tasty.
__label__5	I'm not a huge country music fan, but I had an absolutely fantastic time at Tootsie's.  I would consider some of the songs played as more main stream than Country, but Country is prevalent.  It's a simple formula, great music, libations and wonderful service.  Check it out before the crowds become too overwhelming.
__label__2	"Rude and argumentative stylist. Used incorrect clipper setting and instead of apologizing, made up an excuse and was immediately rude though I was not. 

Wait times were quick."
__label__4	I wanted to try a new pizza place and decided to give this place a shot. Great NY style pizza. Had the wings too. Food was delicious. Service was also good. I will definitely go back to this place.
__label__4	I had the grouper dinner special. It was good but the wait was like 30 to 40 minutes. It was a good thing I was with a friend who I hadn't seen in a long time. Inside the place looks like a dive bar but the food is good.
__label__2	Went there for happy hour. They have some sort of special but it seemed to be an inconvenience to explain what it was. Beers were cold and so was the service.
__label__4	I'm very particular about my nails and when I wanted to switch salons I found this place on Yelp. I called and made an appointment with Jennifer. I've been going to her for a while now and I love it! I've come in with crazy ideas from the internet and she has reproduced them pretty well. She's very nice and personable :)
__label__5	"Good scotch good food need I say more?
Ok I will. 
Cheese fries are amazing.
Bartender knew his stuff."
__label__5	Best rehab I'll ever stay at, the staff was excellent.  PT & OT was 6 days a week and after my stoke 3 days after getting the virus was intense & made it possible for me to become secure enough to get from bed to wheelchair, as well as independent in the bathroom. Sorry to say new rehab facility, if you can call it that is a shithole. Rehab is a joke & I have to do exercises I learned at PowerBack.
__label__1	came in and the server were really rude...after being seated and getting the food after an hour of waiting i found a piece of hair in one of my sushi rolls. i showed it to the server .. at which  point the server stated that it must have been our piece of hair! we left and will never be back... good luck
__label__1	Horrible horrible horrible.  PODS will charge your credit card even if you cancel the service prior to their published cancellation date.  Always double check your CC transactions - these people are crooks.
__label__5	Popped a tire during a bike ride today and $17 later this was repaired and ready to go in five minutes. They are also practicing safe social distancing only allowing a couple customers in at a time. Very impressed.
__label__3	After shopping some wine and spirits for tonights festivities and after looking at all the inviting refreshments at the spirit store, I decided to top it with a cold refreshing beverage..so I'm here with my shopping friend having a cold refreshing tasty drink.
__label__4	Decent food, great prices! I love their buffalo chicken pizza& mozzarella sticks. Fries tend to be a bit soggy. Would order from here again though!
__label__5	This BYOB has excellent food and friendly service, perfect for when you want great Vietnamese but don't want to go all the way to Washington Ave. The food is great overall (shoutout to the pho, spring rolls, and that addictive salad dressing), and the prices are certainly right. The interior is simple but clean, and all of the employees are so sweet and helpful.
__label__1	If you are black you will most likely be seated near the bathroom or kitchen.   I am white and my wife is black.   I usually do not like pulling the race card but we went three times and were always sat next to the bathroom.   We also noticed all the black people and some Hispanic were all in these sections.  I do not patron businesses that support bigotry.
__label__5	Liam was the only one here today and he knocked it out of the park handling all the business by himself. There were six of us at a time and he served us with speed, professionalism, and kindness. Also the poke is really good! Please come here :)
__label__5	Went in on Thursday afternoon and did not have to wait long. Highly recommend. Food is amazing!!
__label__1	I find it interesting that Kristin was furious with Shannon's glitch on the news letter, but doesn't seem the least bit concerned that her online store continues to be 80-90% sold out. As she said on her show, buyers will check out the site once and never come back. There are far too many other options for quality jewelry and home goods to waste time checking back to see if product is available.
__label__5	One of the best beach restaurants I have been in. The food was great and the service could not have been better.  Call ahead seating was a big plus because this place is busy.
__label__5	We stopped by Zinman's on our road trip from Austin to San Diego. We stopped at every vegan place we could and Zinman's was my favorite. The menu changes daily and the variety from Ethiopian to Southern to Asian did not disappoint. The place is charming, clean and comfortable. We even brought our pooch to dine on the patio.
__label__1	"Disappointing. Waited 25 minutes on a Friday for a meatball sandwich and a salad. When I inquired, the woman at the counter said  ""I've waited longer than that in a restaurant"". To which I replied ""Remember you're a deli counter not a restaurant."" This will be the last visit there."
__label__5	Hands down best laundromat I've been to. Clean. Kind and helpful staff. Well lit. Free WiFi. Takes cards and Apple Pay.  Cannot more greatly recommend this place.
__label__4	Great atmosphere. Reminds me places I go to in Austin or NYC. Very hipster-esque. The cocktails are pricey, but I like the changes to the menu each season. Not an every weekend place (especially if you don't want to break the bank), but great for special occasions.
__label__2	I really don't understand how people say this Wingstop is better than BWW. Was super excited to try these wings and was so disappointed! Asked for extra crispy and it seemed like I hadn't even asked for that! Prices are pretty high too!
__label__5	Small place, only 4 at a time during Covid. Parking was easy Nothing is sprayed and they use organic seeds. Support local! Kind girl working. Off the beaten path but on the way to a cute downtown.
__label__4	I've always had a positive experience here when ordering take-out. The food is always made correctly and the service folks are quite friendly. While waiting for my food and looking around, the place has always been clean and organized, and seating is abundant here. I knocked off a star for wait time, because it does take quite a while to wait for my food to come out. I've waited as long as 12-15 minutes before, which is quite lengthy considering its one salad. However, quality is good and their friendly faces still make it a nice experience.
__label__5	Stopped at this little place in vacation with the family.  Looks like nothing from the outside.  We ordered five different menu items.  All fantastic.  We go to Mexico every year and eat out.  It was just as good or better.  Reminded me of Playa.  Service was exceptional!
__label__1	New Port Richey Freedom Boat Club: Jason, the manager, was rude to my wife and inappropriate with my 14-year-old daughter. Other staff member used foul language in front of my daughter and 80-year-old father-in-law. Additionally, I witnessed Jason standby and do nothing other than smoke a cigarette while a returning member struggling to dock a pontoon boat banged off three pilings and two docked boats.
__label__2	"Truly a sub par cheesteak. If you ever find your self in the navy yard for lunch you should head over to URBN for lunch. It is open to the public and one of the coolest buildings. 

On the plus side the cheesteaks are priced for what they are worth. About 5.50 add .50 for cheese and onions"
__label__3	Love City Winery in NYC. Same design here, same quality (good) food. But in this location service was extremely slow. Asking for check multiple times, begging!, waiting 15 mins for it. So if you're really really laid back and not in any kind of a hurry I'd recommend it. Oh, but not when its 50 degrees outside - like today -  as it's also uncomfortably cold inside. Sorry!
__label__5	Recently at a party there with about 50 people and have to say the food was AMAZING. The sushi was fresh, the spicy fish salad delicious, beef negamaki tender....I've been craving more since the party. Had a chance to try so many items and none were a disappointment.
__label__5	Tonight was my first visit to Fud Bar and I was pleasantly surprised.  I got the trout almondine and it was delicious.  Tasted the rotisserie chicken and that was also very good.  The sides were delicious - I can see myself coming back often.
__label__4	"Their Greek food will not let you down! It is consistently good! The falafel is moist on the inside and crispy on the out. One of the best that I have had. Tzatziki is good as well! The pita bread they serve is grilled to perfection as well. 

There are many beers on tap and the service/owner are always very friendly!"
__label__3	I could see how people are sentimental for this place, but unless I lived a few blocks away, I would not go here again. It's average and completely edible greasy pizza. whoopeee. nice gelato, but it really just tastes like ice cream. I am thrilled, however, that they are solar powered.
__label__5	This is best place to leave your dog, it is Universal Studios for dogs! They don't get placed in cages and play all day with other dogs.  My dog literally sleeps for 2 days after getting back from playing so much, the people there truly love dogs.  I wouldn't take my dogs anywhere else.  I think there is a you tube video, check it out.
__label__2	"Overcharged for in cabin filters with a ""lifetime"" warranty and a $20 fee I was not told about to allow this warranty. $200 for an oil change and two filters. This excessive and will not come back again. Staff was polite which is why 2 stars instead of one."
__label__5	Great food and even better service.  Salad bar is the best I have seen for a Brazilian steak house.  Ask for a certain cut and they bring it over immediately.  Give them a try
__label__5	Really high quality food from this little hole in the wall place. Will definitely go back to try more stuff! Super nice staff too. Love it!
__label__2	Small pull thru sites... Barking dogs everywhere.. All the ataff seem to be missing teeth!
__label__1	I would give this place zero stars if that were possible. The one older guy who works there was the absolute rudest piece of shit I've ever encountered at a retail store. Please save yourself the condescending attitude and go to the KOP store instead.
__label__5	I can't seem to get enough of this place!!  It's turned into our weekly stop.  We had Sunday brunch and Friday dinner!  The more I go the more I crave!! The 'chicken' nachos are the BOMB!!! My palette can't get enough!  This is my latest greatest spot.  The owner is personable and welcoming as well!  Great customer service - which honestly makes or breaks a place.  The nachos are truly irresistible.  That being said I'm totally into the 'fish' tacos as well!!
__label__1	Don't bother using the online app to skip the line - food wasn't ready when I got there and had to wait another 15 minutes ...And the order was not correct   Very disappointed
__label__3	Had a good experience on the 4th. The lines where insane but a vast improvement from our visit back in March.
__label__4	Had the pizza delivered to the hotel that I was staying and it took 45 mins. The pizzas are large slices and very good. My only problem was it was very oily.
__label__5	"My husband and I had an amazing meal yesterday night, decided to post a review because we are still talking about how delicious it was, I had the chicken piccata, it was so good, tender, lightly breaded chicken with capers and a light lemon sauce and side of spaghetti, my husband had the lamb Oso bucco, which he raved about, it was tender, and cooked perfectly.
We ate on their patio, the service was great! We highly recommend this restaurant!"
__label__5	I've been to Dandelion three times now! I love this spot. Great location and probably has the best pods in the city. The food is very delicious and the cocktails are on point. We got the jungle lion cocktail in a pitcher, which is a tequila drink! Not too sweet and super good!
__label__5	"Awesome customer service, good prices and they offer ""Mothers"" paste wax! My car looked showroom clean afterwards. Very good job you guys. I will be back!"
__label__4	I went to Burt's with a friend one afternoon last week for lunch. The burgers were tasty and the server's were good. I would recommend anyone in the Feather Sound area to stop by and give it a try.
__label__5	Amazing pizza and service.... we will for sure be going to eat more Pizza. Must go if you haven't tried it.
__label__5	Road our bikes from our hotel on the waterfront to experience this gem before catching our train back to SLO! So worth it! GREAT coffee, Hall and Oats playing on the Sonos, and THE FOOD!!!! We shared the Tug Boat (a kick ass version of a Benedict) and the Chilaquiles...so so so so delicious. Nice folks too!
__label__5	Holistic Pet is my favorite pet store in Franklin! The people that work there are always wonderful and helpful. Last time I went, I needed quite a few things. I had my hands full, so the offered to watch my dog while I shopped- it made my day, and my dog loved all of the attention. The customer service here is unmatched and I didn't even have to ask for help. The range or treats/ toys are also great. Love this place so much!
__label__3	The service had angry overtones, why be angry with customers, who want to enjoy their day by supporting your business? The food was better than average, but I will be going to neighboring restaurants with less attitude.
__label__1	Carpet was to be installed today at the very latest.  Waiting on carpet before photographer arrives tomorrow to take pics to list home.  No carpet, no response to multiple calls.  Totally screwed over by Empire, should have bought from Bob's or anybody else.
__label__2	"I went to the southeast and a doctors assistant wasted my time. hours of time asking questions. So I go back a few days later. And refuses to give me the medication a real doctor was giving me. When I make a doctors appointment I want to see a doctor with respect for people. Why do you have to disagree with a doctors opinion? She ""doesn't feel comfortable"".  It's not right I'm an experienced person of many years and doctors opinion it was fine."
__label__5	Made an appointment, showed up when I was supposed to. Went down the street for a good Mexican breakfast and coffee while my bike was being serviced.  Miguel's a sharp mechanic and had me finished up in no time.  Pointed out a few things too.  Always appreciate that kind of service.   I'll be back!
__label__4	One of my favorite places in Santa Barbara for 2 reasons.. Atmosphere and food. Best views of the harbor and a fun, relaxed, casual atmosphere. Fresh and delicious seafood. Clam chowder is great for a foggy day, baked clams, ahi poke salad, shrimp and crab salad, trasher shark sandwich and fish and chips are all sure to please your taste buds! Make sure you get a homemade Bloody Mary while your there. Popular spot so be prepared for long waits.
__label__3	BJ's brew house has good food but you'll never be able to get that full 45 minutes to over an hour AFTER you sit down, back again. The service is terrible! I don't think it's the servers fault, I just don't think there's enough servers to go around. It'll be a looong time before I go back!
__label__2	"Decent place...  my food / burger was above average, but $$$$ for what you actually get.  I've been here twice and liked my food and the service.  I did a build your own burger, which explains the price.  My 10 yr old did a kids' burger and it was basically a slider, and too small for her age and size.  

I'll likely not be back, based on getting a burger, fries, & soft drink totaling $20 for one person, and leaving slightly hungry."
__label__5	Thank you for my car!! I had one of the easiest and most pleasant car buying experiences thanks to the awesome Staff. The vehicle is exactly as promised and pictured and I couldn't be happier with my new Mercedes E 350. I dealt with a salesman by the name of Ross and he was very knowledgeable and helpful through the whole transaction. Thanks again!!
__label__5	Love this place! I randomly went for the first time back in September when I needed my nails done last minute on the way out of town for a wedding. Very safe with the measures they take with covid and I have had a pleasant experience all three times I have been here to get a manicure and or pedicure. Recommend this place if you want to get in and out quickly but also don't want somewhere that rushes with your mani/pedi.
__label__5	"This review is for Rosa, and it's seriously overdue. 
The girl knows what she's doing, and she really takes the time to understand what you're going for. I used to always complain about my cuts -- sloppy, too short, no style -- until I found her. No BS, after almost every appointment with her I end up texting later that week saying, ""I LOVE THIS CUT."" Keep it up, lady!"
__label__1	My daughter got her makeup done by Ellie for her senior prom & not only did insult her eyebrows telling her they missed a spot whoever did them last, making an 18 year old worried about her appearance on her big day but her makeup did not even match her skin tone. We had to go home and redo it ourselves. Very disappointed!!
__label__5	I don't know if it's because I've been coming here since I was a kid or because the sandwiches are really that good, but I love it. Highly recommend coming by for a turkey sandwich if you are in the neighborhood.
__label__5	Best pasta dishes in town, hands down. The specials are truly special. Chef William has created a wonderful little restaurant with a unique ambiance. It's been a great experience, every visit.
__label__4	"When you just can't decide where you want to eat, Eat-Rite is there for you 24/7.

You want breakfast, or burgers, eggs, bacon, fried chicken, chili, or all of it?  Each bite is better than the previous bite!  Sure, there's only 9 seats in the whole place...but worth the wait if you have to.  Timing is everything.  Just be prepared to rub elbows with a perfect stranger.

Don't let the janky appearance sway you...just go in and be friendly.

Just a great, and I mean GREAT place."
__label__3	Our Super Bowl tradition - get there early, have a beer, order wings to take home, and people watch.
__label__5	Very polite staff and manager. We have food allergies and they were very accommodating. The Crab cakes and fish tacos were excellent. The manager even cleaned a table in the shade (his idea) rather than placing us at one of the many open tables. Just a wonderful place. We will definitely go back!
__label__5	"Excellent service and food, just like last time I was there! I had the chicken Schwarma plate and substituted baba ghanoush instead of green beans, and my friend had the combination plate with lamb and substituted hummus instead of green beans.  I guess we just didn't want green beans that night! 
The plates also come with a side salad which is so fresh and delicious, there's just something about that dressing that's so yummy and fresh! The proportions are pretty large I couldn't finish my meal and my friend couldn't either so we had some leftovers."
__label__5	My kids who are teens wanted me to rate wok&roll 5 star! My kids are very picky and have high standards with food, so that speaks volumes! They seemed impressed! Considering the covid pandemic era were in they are upholding their end on containing a safe clean environment. My kids loved the HUGE selection! Best Buffet they ever had!!! Daughter said they literally had everything I wanted to eat!
__label__1	Had the same experience as Michael .Still waiting for call back from company for missed service calls two days ago.No call back from tech. Or supervisor.I have a contract with the company.and have not received expected service.Very disappointing!Will not use company again
__label__4	They get an A for effort. While I did not purchase a vehicle here, their sales staff was great to talk to. They were helpful and attentive. They did call me to check in and tried their best. Had the soul been available in a manual transmission outside of the base model they would have made a sale. Not their fault but the manufacturers fault. Maybe next time! Thanks for your hard work and diligence!
__label__5	Not only was Steve on time, but he called so Linda could let me know he was around the corner. He was very professional and honest about what he could or could not do. I observed his relationships with his other customers and they all seem to enjoy his presence. I am okay with paying top dollar. You get what you pay for.
__label__5	I'm a big fan of this store - well built,  mostly American made furnishings at very reasonable prices.  I enjoy doing business with family companies, and this is one of the nicest ones you'll find.  The salespeople are knowledgable and honest - can't beat that combination.  Great selection of recliners and Flexsteel products too.
__label__5	Drain Pros was super prompt in their communication.  On time, on quote, and quick. They also provided multiple future solutions to our overall problems. Great service!
__label__1	"After reading the mixed reviews we decided to stop by and give it a shot.  We ordered the dinner buffet.  The food was subpar, all of the meat and rice was cold. It was about 6:30 and it was probably the same food from the lunch buffet.  When we brought the issue up with the server, instead of bringing fresh hot food, she stated it was a buffet and we would have stir the food to get it warm.  

Overall a bad experience.  Their egg drop soup was good but that's about it b"
__label__4	"This place is really cute! I love boutiques and really wish there were more where I live in Illinois. Everything is so unique and one of a kind.

This place has really cute earrings, rings, necklaces, gift items, and clothing. It's a small store, but laid out well so it's easy to browse. I bought a pair of black studs that when the light hits them glimmer w/ a purple sparkle. Super cute!

I would definitely check this place out if you like unique jewelry!"
__label__1	I'm a regular costumer and I think the food is very good. The service is almost always slow and today I was treated with outright rudeness by an employee.  If the service was better I'd eat there much more often.
__label__3	I come from NYC, where Vietnamese food is super cheap and the menus have 400 dishes on them. I guess I can't expect too much from an Uptown Vietnamese place. The pho is huge and the rare beef actually is served rare. The eggrolls are hella pricey. I'm used to getting 6 egg rolls for $3 (and being served with lettuce wraps and extra herbs and cuckes), instead of two for $4 with no extras. The service is super friendly, sometimes a little pushy.
__label__1	Should have done it myself. Actually came home and vacuumed again and wiped down condole. Terrible. Will never go back.
__label__3	Went here cause we were staying at the Howard Johnson, portion sizes are tremendous. And the tuna fish spread appetizer was very tasteful. I did however not really enjoy my fried clam basket, not too much flavor there.
__label__2	Food is NOTHING SPECTACULAR!  I'm not sure what everyone elses idea of great Mexican food is, but this is not it. The cooks/staff were not friendly/helpful.  Not worth the prices! Meat was very dry some BURNT, and almost NO FLAVOR!  DEFINITELY WON'T BE GOING BACK
__label__5	Excellent food taste. The food had a solid consistency and tasted good in my mouth! The chef was so nice and interesting !!!!! Love this place would recommend to all!!
__label__1	"Sorely disappointed AGAIN! I thought I'd try their Sushi/Sashimi Lunch one more time. Sadly, like before, the sushi rice is sub-par. It's cooked granted, but not seasoned, just plain dry unflavorful rice! My sashimi was room tempature (or below) & is my raw fish supposed to smell fishy? I didn't think so!! 

Maybe the chef ought to get some flavor profiles and techniques from the chefs at Sushi Bistro in Kirkwood!!  

I will not be back."
__label__5	I love this place. The sandwich selection is impressive and their daily specials are also not your run of the mill sandwiches. They serve homemade chips and they hippie theme makes it that much better. I work in the area sometimes and when I do I come here for lunch.
__label__2	"Hmmm the menu seemed very cool
But that's just it. It wasn't amazing but it wasn't terrible either. I'd rather eat at shack shake"
__label__4	Best part of Pinwewood Social is the social. The baby swimming pools, bocce ball, outdoor patio and bowling. Make a reservation if you plan to go on the weekend for an of the activities. The tater tots weren't earth shattering but the pancakes melted my heart. Presentation was everything and the coffee came with a whole kit. Try it if you are in Nashville. Every bachelorette party in the city made a stop here.
__label__3	Burger was good, and I loved the mayo bar. The fries were overcooked and hard. Be aware that you have to buy your side(s) and drink(s) separately from the cost of the burger. I think it's a little steep to pay $20 for something I could get at Wendy's for less than $10.
__label__4	"Great food and great service.

Cobb salad: huge bowl with shredded chicken, very fresh veggies.

Roasted salmon; it's spicy which isn't my liking and not described in the menu. I told the waitress about it and she gladly changed it to be not spicy. It comes with perfectly cooked grilled asparagus. I subbed the potato salad with mixed green salad with $2 extra which I discovered after the bill , and that's why I took one star down"
__label__3	We go here for their Chicken breast and their french roast whole bean coffee.
__label__5	"Fresh bread and ingredients and high quality meats ""piled high,"" as they say at Daggwoods, make this THE best sandwich place in town. Ample sized sandwiches that are big enough to share. Or you can just buy a half. Hot, cold, meat, veggie; dozens of choices. Salads, chili, soups, sides and desserts that meet the same high standards for freshness and taste. Reasonable prices for it all.  They deliver too."
__label__4	Traveling from Arizona to Vancouver, BC we stopped in Nampa for the evening. After searching for a non chain restaurant we settled on Gino's. We were not disappointed. Fun atmosphere and very clean. Food was good and the service friendly and efficient. If we stop in the area again we would definitely return.
__label__5	"This 5 stars goes out to our waitress MADISON! The food was obviously tasty but her service made our visit here A+. A mouth at our table was NEVER dry she was keeping up with the refills, requests, and all of the above while attending to other tables. She had great suggestions for what to order and was helpful with deciding between dishes. I hope next time we visit she is there again.
Thanks Madison!"
__label__5	Loved this place! Great food (Chicken w/Red Beans & Rice) and great service at the bar :) will definitely go back!
__label__4	Loved the food here!  The set up is a little interesting with the waiting in line to order then they bring you your food, but the food is absolutely amazing.  One of the few places you can get good burrata cheese.  The pizza was delicious and we love the naples style of crust - it's head and shoulders above other pizza places in the area.
__label__5	I love the way my nails turned out! I had to get them fixed from a previous manicure that wasn't done very well. I was seated right when I walked in the door, I was offered something to drink, and I was given colors to choose from right away. The appointment took less than 40 minutes which can sometimes mean that the nails aren't going to turn out very well but I can tell my lady knew what she was doing. This place is right down the street from my house and I will definitely be going back!
__label__5	This is our first time having breakfast here. Lawd have mercy. It took me by surprise. This is really good. When I have potatoes with my breakfast, I have to add seasoning. Not these potatoes. Well seasoned. Their sausages look like they are on steroids. They are so big. We were surprised. Definitely making this our breakfast spot.
__label__1	Pizza was super soggy, drinks were overpriced and weak. Oysters were overpriced also to me, and the waitress did not inform us of any specials. Will not return.
__label__1	"I came here regularly for years, the coffee is definitely good. But today I was spoken to by a manager in a way that was extremely inappropriate, including him cutting me off and saying ""I don't care"". I definitely feel they were discriminatory against me, and as I was calmly trying to express myself and clarify I was cut off and shown no sympathy or courtesy. Very bad experience and I won't be returning due to their unprofessionalism."
__label__1	This yogurt is so gross... I threw mine away after taking notes a few bites. I can't put my finger on what's wrong with it, but it's not good AT ALL. It sucks because I was excited about a yogurt place down here in Rita.
__label__2	I would not recommend this place at all. Ordered loaded fries which were absolutely terrible and the meat was weirdly sweet, which probably came out of a can, to be honest. Also ordered crab legs which were decent but they couldn't find me crab crackers for over 20 min so I couldn't eat the claw and harder legs so they were cold. Very disappointed.
__label__3	Don't Go Here! The food is fantastic and ambience is cool! I've lived on St. Pete Beach for 20 years now and I have to say the place has been consistently good the whole time. Stop coming to Snapper's and filling up all the tables! I need to eat here and you're in the way!
__label__2	"1.Very loud because of kids
2.Very sliw service
3. Not nice host and waiter
4.Espresso machine was not working"
__label__2	The food was great.. Fries were perfectly fried and chicken didn't taste reheated. The service was below average. They didn't have their hours posted on any of the entrances and the employees weren't sure of exact hours of when they opened or closed
__label__2	"What a poor excuse for a Japanese restaurant.  Linguini noodles as udon? Disgusting sauces! Tea in a tea bag!? Making an order to go as you order it at a sit down restaurant!? Are you kidding?! 

The only good part was the service.  It's a poor attempt to copy Benihana. Nice try but not worth it at all!!"
__label__3	Healthy stuff but really nothing exciting in flavor to me. The gumbo was decent but really small for price.
__label__5	One of my favorite places to get fresh fruits and vegetables. Got nuts in salads milk and eggs. Vegetables are always fresh and there's always someone helpful answer any questions . It's normally busy there but the lines are quick and the prices a great
__label__5	This is a Fun place, with plenty of golfing sections, good variety of delicious food, friendly staff. It is Good for going alone or with a group.
__label__4	If you're looking for an expensive furniture you should check this place. I bought a wooden bed from here for a very good deal and assembled it for just 30 minutes without the help of anyone. Very good customer service as well. Came back the next day and bought a end table for just $30. I'll come back for sure.
__label__5	Phenomenal!! I got the classic dark tenders and they were the perfect amount of crunchy on the outside and moist and juicy in the inside. Never had such great tenders in my life! I also got the orzo salad and half baked cookie- both delicious. So many options that I didn't get to try... Will need to come back! This place is very friendly and has unique yummy options. My only complaint is that it is a little expensive.
__label__5	"I love this little boutique shop; it has a great variety of styles and high-quality pieces. I found a lot of interesting, distinctive pieces that I haven't seen anywhere else. I made out like a bandit on their clearance rack too, scoring a dress for a quarter of the price it was listed at the upscale retail shop up the street. 

But what will definitely make me a repeat customer was the outstanding customer service! I accidentally left another small shopping bag on the counter when I was making my purchase, and an employee chased me down the street *several* blocks to return it. Very unexpected and hugely appreciated."
__label__3	There ok.nothing great !when you have had really good Chinese food and you get this ....then that is why they are just ok.
__label__1	It takes forever to get the food right, employees seem to be not caring. Food is too greasy. Bbq mix comes with the skinny strips of ribs.
__label__4	"This is one of our favorite parks in Jersey, so far. The little lake that's there provides a nice view, especially when you're up on top of the hill sitting on one of the benches. People also fish in the lake as well. The hill provides a really good view for the sunset as well.
There are trails to walk, dog play section, jungle gyms for kids, picnic tables and everything is clean and well kept."
__label__4	Great wings, slow smoked over Cherry wood. Then served with a white sauce. Best wings in town! These are not Hot wings, if you want hot wings go elsewhere. The soups are quite good. The food is reasonable, and service is always good. Nice craft beers on draft. The owners are always on site, which shows they care!
__label__5	Sooo delicious and healthy!! I love their salads/wraps- they are absolutely flavorful without the fat. The flat breads are amazing too! Very friendly staff and every time I go I am very happy with my purchase/experience.
__label__4	"The food was delicious! If you're in the mood for an extra cheesy meal, this is the place. Very rich, could only eat about half of my ""Big Cheezy"" but definitely hit the spot. The wait wasn't bad, came in at lunch time and waited about 15 minutes. Would highly recommend trying it out!"
__label__5	Always good and lots of choices. Good value for the money if you go when you are hungry. Have noticed that some days during the week seems slower to get your food than during the busier weekend which is odd but if you order a few things at once you won't notice the wait for the next rounds...never had any issues here
__label__4	"I'm no fan of Mexican food or any of its Americanized bastardizations so it says something for The Green Chile that I am giving them four stars.
God, that burrito with the red Chile sauce is heavenly."
__label__1	My girl friend went in for help with a hair problem. The stylist she got was mean and snotty, We will never go back there....
__label__2	"Still needs to figure some things out. Been here a few times. Service is pretty bad. All around... every server I've had (all 3 times) has been awful. One got mad at us, one we saw twice, and the last one also got mad at us for asking for napkins. Terrible. 

The food is pretty good. 

Beers are ok. As expected it's gooseisland- not expecting much. 

Space is cool, very open. 

Hope they figure the service out. It's really bad."
__label__5	My best friend and I were wandering around Jackson Square and stumbled upon Muriels. This place has the best drinks, but only ask for MARY. She took care of us and made us feel SO welcomed. Mary is personable and knew from my previous drinks exactly what I wanted. We will be back only if she serves us!
__label__5	We love The Novel Neighbor! The staff is always very helpful and good at recommending books for specific ages of children. They are a great addition to the neighborhood.
__label__1	Last Friday: Service was fast, food was about the same as what I'd make at home. Witnessed an employee drop bread on the floor, pick it up, put it in the toaster and then serve it to some poor schmo. First and last visit.
__label__5	Great haircut and beard shape! Friendly and talkative barber! I will definitely be back in a few weeks!
__label__4	East Coast is always an excellent meal for our family.  We enjoy their pizza and we have always had great service.  We also now enjoy the fact that we can order online.  Thanks
__label__2	Tried the loco moko, which is like a sautéed burger patty in sauce- that was okay. That lunch platter comes with 2 sides, I picked corn and Mac and cheese. It's hard to mess up corn, so that was okay although plain I added salt and pepper. The Mac and cheese was horrendous, it tasted like the milk used for it for spoiled. Wouldn't recommend their hot food, wraps and sandwiches looked good and saw many people buying them- should've went with that :(
__label__1	Went to Next Care on Harrison and Old Spanish Trail for covid19 test. What was suppose to be curb side testing, ended up me having to go inside after waiting in my care for 2 hours. Then once inside, nurse told me I had to wait for staff member (Casandra Owens FNP) to speak to me after test was completed. When I said I didn't want to be in the building in the first place. The nurse told me that if I left then my test would be thrown away
__label__5	This place is great. The food lives up to the hype. Burger, meatloaf sandwich, fish and chips, Indian chicken sandwich are all amazing. The have great specials for brunch and dinner. I seriously doubt you could get a bad dish here  bar is small and tables are hard to come by. Well worth the wait.
__label__4	Although the drive through isn't as fast as I'd like, the staff are super friendly and the location is convenient.  I stop at this location almost daily and my order is always perfect!
__label__1	On February 14, 2012 I called to report money was jacked from my 93 year old WW II Vet father's account. Branch manager could not care less. They actually wanted him to come in to the branch to fill out paperwork...93!  I had to call Eight on Your Side to get his money put back into his account. It took weeks! I ordered a new debit card for him on February 15th, still haven't received it. I've opened an account for him at the Credit Union. C-YA 5/3rd!!
__label__5	"This place does pretty much any type of work on your vehicle!! I brought my truck here for the 30,000 miles service after I got a quote from the dealer  ship and let me tell you something before you go to your ""dealership"" shop around because this guys save me $600 for the same service!! Customer service here is the best."
__label__5	Our server was the bomb! He was so kind and friendly. The food was great! The smoked ribs were off the chain!!
__label__4	Top 5 in the city, without question the best anything north of the city.   The pizza is great and anyone who says otherwise doesn't know pizza.  The pasta is really good too, but doesn't travel well.  The sandwiches could honestly use work, I'm not a fan of their bread choices.  All around, a very solid spot.
__label__4	I really like this place. This spot is intimate but still had a really communal feel to it. I met a friend here today for a late lunch. Great drink specials everyday. Nice to see a varied list of food specials daily, too. I settled on the Bison sliders, which were pretty darn good (I subbed cheddar for pepper jack). The staff is really friendly and helpful. I will definitely be returning here again.
__label__4	I used to eat at Smash burger almost weekly, and although I've outgrown that phase (thankfully), once in a while a Triple Double really hits the spot. I've never had an issue with the staff or any kind of excessive wait for food or service. I love their Smash fries, especially bc of their unique spices that set them apart from your average fry (Cough, cough, McDonalds). A must-try if you love hot and juicy burgers!
__label__1	The is probably the worst meal I've had since I moved to Tucson. This is not a tamale. This place was recommended, but I'm sorry to say it disappointed. The food was super bland and everyone around us had to drench their tamales in salsa to get flavor. I will stick to the Mexican market off Prince street for my Mexican food.
__label__5	My fave go to for Pho and noodles.  And it's still very reasonably priced.  Bo tai Chanh appetizer is my regular.  And old school Viet music as well, makes me feel at home.  Love this place.
__label__5	I have been to see Sarah at Encore for my hair cuts and color many times. She always cuts my hair and colors it to compliment my face shape. I get a lot of compliments on how the style fits me well! So happy and I will continue to go back!
__label__5	I received a full body massage 3 weeks postpartum after experiencing complications and a back injury. Lindsey K. Was absolutely amazing! I've had many massages and this was by far the BEST one I've had! I could feel the aches and pain releasing from my body. 10/10 would recommend, go see them!
__label__5	Had the Pulled Pork sandwich ....oh....my....GOD .....it was gooooooooooooood. Hard to get a seat, rightfully so. I'd cut in line in front of my own Grandmom for another sandwich from DiNic's.
__label__5	Owner, Chris Cantrell, coached me to recovery from knee replacement surgery. After some months, I graduated from private sessions with Chris to group classes.  The studio offers such a peaceful environment.   Pilates is the only form of exercise I've never wanted to quit, thanks to the great teachers at Pilates Powerhouse!
__label__5	Can I give this 10 stars? Service is super fast! Went here for lunch and we were seated right away. Try the soup dumplings! I went to soup dumpling heaven on my first bite!!! Had to bring home some more dimsum for dinner!
__label__5	Great place, service and food! Cute, frog themed decor. Lots of hot coffee always kept refilled. Wanted to try the cinnamon roll French toast, ended up with eggs/hash browns/toast. Been there twice. St. Pete and North Redington Beach(?). Further north on Gulf blvd. Both equally deelish!
__label__2	Have usually been happy with takeout from Chili's however this last visit the portions were very skimpy. The full-size salad I ordered was the size of a side salad. I had to pay six dollars for three extra chicken strips. The appetizers I ordered also were smaller than what was served in the restaurant.
__label__5	"My only experience with TCB is the cupcakes. So far I have tried Red Velvet, Chocolate on Chocolate. Brownie (yep! It's a cupcake!), Vanilla with Peppermint Icing,  Very Vanilla and Cream Cheese Icing.

Now you should know that my mom makes the best cream cheese icing I have ever eating. Don't tell her, but TCB has matched that taste! I live very far from my mom and so I was thrilled to find an icing that matched Mom's.

Great service. Cute place. Fantastic cupcakes!"
__label__1	This is possibly the worst Dunkin Donuts location I've ever been to. It's unfortunate that it's the closest location to me. It never fails that every single time I come here I am told to pull into a parking spot and wait 5-10 minutes for my order. The people usually working the drive thru are very rude. It's a bad experience every time I come to this location.
__label__5	"I recommend to start with an appetizer karaage!! Its awesome! Pair it with nigori sake! Or sapporo if you prefer  then go for the spicy dosunco ramen! its pretty good! It comes with bamboo shoots, cabbage, egg and the sexy meat called ""pork"""
__label__5	Carrillo is my favorite dining common from the other three on UCSB's campus. They always have a great variety of veggies, options, side dishes, main dishes, soups, and desserts. The staff are friendly and welcoming. The atmosphere has an outside patio, booths, tables, and bar-like tables. I miss going here for meals everyday.
__label__5	Roger and his staff have created an out of this world dining experience! Took 6 of our friends here last night and it was awesome. His take on Mediterranean food is amazing...everything is so fresh and tasty...Prices are quite reasonable (actually think they should charge more!) and the quality is like no other place I have been to. Can you tell we are huge fans of this place? Keep up the great work Roger and team!!
__label__4	Updated Review: the customer service here is still crappy, but I will say the food is still good. Better than your average burger meal without all the grease of Five Guys and a better portion than Steak n Shake. I will say I just now tried the milkshake, Vanilla Bean, and I've been missing out! It was the bomb like better than Chick fil A, Steak n Shake, and anyone else you can name. The fries on the other hand could be less burnt and uhm less stingy as well.
__label__4	This is a great place to either browse books to buy or just sit and read a book or magazine where it's quiet. They have nice chairs throughout the store to read in and it's well laid out. The coffee shop seems worth trying but I have always been here in the evening and not been in the mood for caffeine!
__label__2	Came here when stuck in Indianapolis over Thanksgiving. I've been here before, but the meal experience this time was pretty poor. I ordered the half rack of ribs. While they tasted good, I would describe the portion more of a quarter slab. The entire slab was about 2 x 6 inches. With about half of that bones, that meant the actual amount of meat was about 2 x 3 inches. Pretty lame for an $18 entree.
__label__5	"This is by far the nicest and most female friendly place I have ever been.  From the polite person on the other end of the phone every time I call, to the explanation of what is wrong with the car to the details on why.  I appreciate this place giving back some votes for humanity.  

Also my fiance had a flat tire one day and he stopped what he was doing to pull his car in and fix it with a used tire to save money!  

What a great guy! What a great place!

PS-- You should drive out of your way for this place, it is worth it."
__label__2	I went one weekday morning craving crepes.  I ordered the cobbler crepe that came with fruit.  It arrived and I was underwhelmed.  It came with what tasted like apricots out of a can that had sat in the refrigerator and absorbed the taste of one.  In addition the fruit was cold.  I ordered the French press coffee (which I make at home) and it tasted like a cup from one of the casino buffets.  This is the second time I have been there hoping it would get better.  After trying to find a parking space in Midtown, this was a disappointing experience.
__label__5	We had such a great time working with Kelli! We had a little, intimate courthouse elopement and Kelli captured it all so beautifully! She stuck with us through multiple locations, despite the Sacramento heat! And she made us both look fantastic. We were so lucky to have found her!
__label__5	Been a co-op member since 2011. Best deals on locally produced organic foods in the area. Owners are helpful, honest, and friendly. They carry a wealth of knowledge about recipes, gardening, as well as a fantastic selection of fruit, vegetables, meat, poultry, dairy, and seafood. Give this place a try and discover the difference in food that has been raised for nourishment as opposed to food that has been raised to just look nice on supermarket shelves.
__label__2	gal who took my order was able to work the register- no smile- no can I help you- place was slow but took 40 minutes to get our food- the waffle was hard n cold and not edible the chicken not too bad but not worth the price- $30. for 2 ppl for chicken and sweet tea? wont be back
__label__4	When I walked into this bar, I knew something just felt right.  After initially thinking it was just my general love of the macabre, I realized that between the skeletons and skulls adorning the place was Chicago swag!  Being originally from Chicagoland, it felt like a little bit of home.  Beyond that, the atmosphere in this bar was just cool.  As I was here in the summer, I'm sure it wasn't as crazy as it gets when school is in, but the drinks were strong, the staff friendly, and reminders of home everywhere - what more could a girl want?
__label__5	"Love me some Sauce on the Side. So happy I have one down the street from me. When my son wants pizza and I don't, we compromise on Sauce on the Side. My favorite is the Duke. It is full of a bunch of flavors and you can never go wrong with BACON!!
Service is good and always quick when I order."
__label__5	One of my favorite local restaurants, have eaten here numerous times,  Their steaks, pterodactyl wings, and bread pudding are all winners. On the weekends it can take a while to get in, because of the popularity and small size,  The staff are friendly and efficient.  If you order the bread pudding it's is enough for 2 to 4,  an out of this world delicacy. Everything I have ordered here has been very good with large portions.
__label__4	Awesome beer selection, loved their BBQ pork pizza, and kid friendly!
__label__5	I just want to say thanks the hardworking staff at The Flavor Spot for taking the time to prepare  real authentic Jamaican cooking, I had almost everything on the menu and is not disappointed.  Jerk chicken is the bomb not to mention the curry goat and the steam fish with okra i can't wait for my next trip to the Flavor Spot.
__label__1	Was just ok! Rice was cold. Fish wasn't fully cooked! Something to do while in the Lou. Probably won't go back. But I did it. Wait staff was very nice!
__label__5	This place was the BOMB! $1.50 lemon drops, can't beat it. Sean or was it John? Can't remember, I'm drunk & happy & satisfied. Great service. That dude knows how to juggle when it gets crowded. Go for happy hour, you won't regret it. Nice locale & good vibes.
__label__5	"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJKCQLx_K0M&feature=plcp

Palace Cafe was so wondeful. Thank you for helping us with our school project. Please watch this video. The more views the video gets, the better grade we get for our midterm!"
__label__5	Everything was delicious, we ordered the tuna tar tar, the crab cakes and the rib eye, the drinks an dessert all top noch
__label__5	Ever since Covid started, I've only been ordering takeout delivery, and I have to say how impressed I am with the cleanliness and set up of this place! Not only is the food fast, tasty, and full of healthy options, but the safety protocols they have set up surpass any other place I've been to so far. They even have a speaker system so you can hear each other through the plexiglass front. Good food, friendly service, fair prices, and safe setup.
__label__5	Was craving a cannoli and found this place on yelp and was super happy that they were made fresh and only had to wait 5-10 minutes so great!!!
__label__1	"I wish I can review 0 star. This place is SICK. I found died fly in my miso soup. Waitress added 20% tip without any notification. I didn't know that so I ended up ""Double tip"" her. I am normally generous to pay for the good service fee but She was NOT GREAT AT ALL. Make sure to check your receipt. It was very tricky. They pre-charged you ""20%"" tip. WTF"
__label__5	We had a fabulous dinner on a first night in NOLA.  The oysters were the freshest and most delicious I've had anywhere.  We both had the shrimp and grits Napoleon with fried green tomatoes and every bite was wonderful.  The service couldn't have been better and we'd highly recommend this Bourbon Street restaurant.
__label__4	After having a not so great experience one time at this place, I'm glad to report its just a one time thing and that their banhmi is better. Almost as good as my fav place QT in Chinatown, but this one is a close second after trying it for a second time. The one with the roast pork is my absolutely favorite. Need to try their non banhmi food for next time.
__label__3	The service at Happy Garden Restaurant is effortlessly charming and the spring rolls are pretty good, but the rest of the whitewashed menu is just a notch or two above average.  Overrated, I'm afraid.
__label__1	Birthday party ticket what a waste of time waited Two hours just for three ticket draws which just happened to be there friends
__label__5	"Yup. It's about as good as it gets. The medium and hot were about the same spice level and they were very bearable. I didn't want to try the xtra hot as I don't like blowing out my tastebuds.

The fried chicken itself is superb."
__label__3	We came here for the great happy hour specials. Busy place, nice atmosphere
__label__5	Yes!!!  The brisket here is out of this world. Such a perfect spice and wonderfully moist!  The sides change all the time so make sure to check the board so you don't miss anything!  They also have very friendly staff and a great beer selection. Come in for a brisket sandwich and 2 for 1 beers!  Life is good because of BBQ joints like Edley's
__label__4	Both myself and my father use this business for our a/C and plumbing needs.  For the most part we are very happy with them.  They do a very through preventative maintenance.  I really like the 9.95 a month one price for pm contract.  One thing  I'm not really keen on is the techs writing the invoice, it seems to me it would be more accurate if it came from the office. But maybe that's the way the industry does it, I'm not sure.
__label__3	This is your standard run of the mill chain restaurant.  A colleague of mine and I enjoyed a lunch of Spinach Dip, Teriyaki Chicken Bites and a Balsamic Chicken Caesar Salad.  Everything was good on taste but the Teriyaki chicken bites were AMAZING.  I'm not one to rave about anything chicken, but this dish blew me away.
__label__5	Great dude, great service. Very professional. Repaired my ac within an hour of calling him. Definitely recommend. Thanks mitch for the awesome response time. 5 stars all day long
__label__5	"If in Tucson you must make a stop at the Parish. Great service, awesome food, reasonably priced. A shout out to Alexis ""our server"". Very attentive, engaging and personable."
__label__5	"Stopped into Little Greek while around the area for work, it is new, clean and yummy. I loved having a Greek salad that I could actually select the ingredients, extra kalamata olives and no onions for me. I took home some baklava.

Heavenly."
__label__4	Good food after mourning. Terrible machines. The breakfast I had today was the worst. Runny watery eggs, the potatoes had a strong aroma of rancid oil. One pad of butter for cardboard toast. Yet friendly staff.  But cmon. That was just gross.
__label__4	"This is the first time I'd had fried alligator.

It tasted like a chicken that could kick my ass.

The chicken/andouille gumbo was a little disappointing.

The catfish was great.

The boudin was fine.

The mac n' cheese was good."
__label__5	This is an amazing local florist. The ladies here put together beautiful arrangements at just about any price point. My wife loved her anniversary flowers!! If you need flowers for any occasion, I seriously can't recommend this place enough. Professional and extremely kind. I'll definitely be back.
__label__5	Great place.  Great service.  Gumbo was perfect. I wish I could stay longer just to cure my hangovers with the gumbo.
__label__2	"Really disappointed. Ordered fried mushrooms to start with, couldn't eat them, soggy and so unappealing. Told server, He charged me for them. Sisters meal was better, ground beef patty with gravy, beans were boring. The other item ordered was a burger, was ok. The side salad had a lot of croutons on it and the side dressing had spilled all over it. 
Go for the view, service slow.
They did take off the mushrooms after I asked for a manager."
__label__5	I love this place, I even hate to let out my little south street nail secret. The girl here are kind and do a great job. I always get compliments on my manicures after seeing the ladies at Queen. I wont get my nails done anywhere else. It does tend to get busy on Saturdays and evenings so you can call and make and appt. They also are closed on Sundays which is my only complaint.
__label__5	This place was mega proper! Could be the best Mexican food I've had in South Jersey. Will definitely return for round two, three and four!
__label__5	"Really a great exhibition space and on par if not better than most public art galleries in North America.  It's not the Met or the Guggenheim, but it's as good as the VAG and the Musee des beaux arts.

The really well done Karsh, Goya and Degas exhibits have moved on, but now we've got M.C. Escher and the ""Art of Warner Bros."": Bugs and Daffy.

You bet I'm going."
__label__4	More laid back then the Mad Mex in University City but still a good place to go for a bite to eat and drinks. The service was good, Frozen Margaritas were great, and the Honey Chipotle BBQ wings were delicious!
__label__4	Bustling restaurant in the heart of Clayton! There definitely needs to be more seating for such a hot spot! The calzones are great, besides salads, that is the only item they serve. So if your looking for a traditional pizza or pasta, don't go there. The Nutella and banana calzone is my favorite! A must try! I also love the calzone bread, it's made fresh and super soft and buttery! Great lunch spot!
__label__4	Wow! I have never tasted food like this that came from a hotel restaurant. Turkey burger, sweet potato fries, awesome! Great service - fast and friendly and not over-priced!
__label__5	I had kimchi pho and my wife had traditional pho, we both had fresh spring rolls.  Everything was outstanding including the quality, cleanliness, service, price, portions, and overall value.
__label__1	"Awful! Don't eat here, very bad service. Didn't get our food before we had to leave; had to cancel.  Then manager ""too busy"" to come out and talk to us. The group after us was served before us, we think they lost our ticket.  Never again."
__label__5	Very cool and knowledgeable place.  Treated me right on my visit,  will continue to frequent.
__label__4	Very clean friendly staff and good food. Beats the restaurants around it. Wish I had eaten there sooner instead of trying other places
__label__5	Its a heaven for Indian food lovers. Delicious curries and well made breads : the place has a simple and quiet ambience. The food was equally good as veg and non veg.
__label__4	Had lunch at this Jimmy John's. The staff was very friendly and the sandwiches were made very fast. The dining area was very clean. The only issue we had was finding napkins. Overall, another great Jimmy sandwich.
__label__2	The Hilton Garden Inn Highland Manor Tampa is older and in need of many repairs. For the cost that a customer pays for a room with Hilton they should be clean. This room was dirty dusty moldy & smelly. The pics are from a stay in May 2020 showing cracks in the ceiling, mold growing in the bathroom shower, dust on all solid surfaces. This is during COVID 19 and all cleaning should've been above normal standards. Clearly cleaning is being overlooked and skipped in this hotel. Clearly not Hilton standards.
__label__5	I don't normally like this kind of food but this stuff is good. The chicken salad is really good. The place is clean. I'll be back.
__label__4	"Always come here for produce. The freshest of the fresh!

Great service and wide selection.

Love this location - inside the Reading Terminal Market (always a big draw)! So much to choose from. Go to Iovine and be inspired to make a refreshing salad, sizzling stir fry or hearty stew from their fruit and veg.

Delicious!"
__label__1	"Gross. Ground fish in the sushi rolls was disgusting. Asked waitress how many rolls in an order of spring rolls and she said ""i dont know much about sushi"". Ummmmm...?!?!?!?"
__label__5	This place is actually very good.  The slices are big and floppy, with a crust that is crispy to the point of being a little charred on the bottom.  This place beats out SoHo, but not by as much as I may have thought initially.  It also ranks well above Lorenzo's.
__label__3	Pupusas are good! Only rating 3 stars because the place needs to be more clean , salad bar is disgusting I've witnessed kids playing with the curtido and salsas.  Cashiers need to be more friendly.
__label__5	I really love the food and the service here! I almost always order the curry puffs and the chicken satay! Their Thai Iced Tea is a bit sweet but it's a welcome distraction from the spicy food.
__label__5	This is a great little low key diner. Good breakfast food at a good price and they keep your coffee cup filled. The pancakes are delicious! They have great fried potatoes too.
__label__3	Came here for a large party for brunch. Food was okay. The tots were good. My gripe is with the poor service. There was a fly in my friends mimosa, she asked for another one and the waitress tells us that they are out of champagne which is shocking since it was 1:00pm on a Sunday.
__label__3	"Ask the price of any specials or appetizers before you order! 

The food was better than average but the 3 times we went we had sticker shock after ordering from their specials. $40 entree that should have been $25 and $16 appetizer that should have been $5. Our bill was close to double what it should have been.  The meal was enjoyable but the price extravagant.

Either stick to the menu (which has the prices) or ask the price of anything not on the menu before you order and your experience should be average to above average."
__label__4	Great Sandwiches! We've eaten in the restaurant & done take out. Restaurant & bar area is rather dark. I love the Italiano pork sandwich. These meals don't come with fries though. I would have rated it at 5 stars, but when we called for take out, the man that answered was pretty rude about order requests. Courtesy is just as important as the quality of the food.
__label__4	Checking out the local breweries in the Tampa area we cam across this one and what nice treat it was. The tasting room is huge. The beer selection is huge. The flavors were pretty big too. I had a nice cold pint of the Control Freak, a pale ale,  that was very satisfying on an 80 degree afternoon. Lise felt the same way about her DIPA, the Mangrove. Nice, relaxed atmosphere with picnic tables inside and out. We only tried these 2 but we will be back because they have another 26 for us to try!
__label__4	Always a favorite place of mine when in Nashville!  The music is always great. Top notch bands. I like that we could reserve seats online too. Our server was very attentive. Food menu is typical bar food and draft beers may not be 16 Oz. Not sure. We liked the fried pickles, gumbo and fish sliders.
__label__3	A decent ramen shop for Tucson. I tried the black garlic ramen, takoyaki and fried octopus. The food is okay but somewhat overpriced and not very authentic. I may stop by once a year or so to check them out but nothing I'd crave for.
__label__2	"I am not about the Pita Pit.

Most of their wraps are not great. The Chicken Caesar is actually really good though.

But anyways, we got catering and they completely messed everything up. We only wanted to types of wraps, and they sent a complete mess. They were SO rude on the phone.

They do deliver until 4 am, so that's pretty bomb."
__label__5	"Honestly great food, can't go wrong with any menu item.
Never had a bad meal... truly a hidden gem.."
__label__4	"The seafood pancake was a huge portion, so it's great to share with another person or as an appetizer. I love that the green onions didn't overpower the taste and that it wasn't greasy. 
The seafood tofu soup was good as well, except that the egg wasn't runny by the time we got it, and I prefer it to be runny in the soup. But the tofu was delicious."
__label__5	I'm so grateful for the amazing work of Dhara and the pelvic health center. Dhara is an exceptional and devoted therapist . I am so grateful to have her as part of my health care team. My visits are worth every dollar to help me heal, to stay active, and to support my own efforts to stay active as I age.
__label__4	A typical college pub - food is good, beer selection not bad, service, while perhaps not as ideally attentive as I'd like, was acceptable. For the late-night, after-concert need for sustenance, particularly involving some fermented grains - this is your place in this neighborhood.
__label__4	Cute, traditional diner with a long history.  It's obviously very popular with the locals.  We went for lunch during the week, my first time.  Great service, hardworking waitresses.  We ordered eggs, hash browns, chicken fried steak with gravy, orange juice, and coffee.  Everything was excellent.  Honestly, I've never had better anywhere.  Extremely casual atmosphere.  It's cash only, which is unusual, but just fine as long as you know before you go.
__label__3	The beer selection here is impeccable but you will pay top dollar for it.  The food menu looked good but again the prices seemed a bit high.  Plenty of tv screens all around but the only really good viewing seats were at the bar.  If I'm in the mall and its raining or snowing I would opt to eat and drink here over Fox and Hound but other than that... I'm walking across the street for better prices and portions.
__label__2	"Too loud, too overpriced.. This place hangs on because of the ""old"" Olga's.  Much better options in Marlton."
__label__5	It was my first time here the food was delicious and the most thing I liked in this place was the customer service. The burger was bomb planing to try the rest for the next time.
__label__5	The Benchmark Eatery The food was well-made and delicious the outside sitting area is awesome this is the spot in Santa Barbara you need to check out and visit
__label__5	Wonderful beers on tap.   The harvest salad is excellent.   Also shared pretzels with good dipping sauce
__label__5	Everyone at Best Care is very welcoming, friendly and professional. Our six cats are always treated very with care and tenderness.  With the restrictions due to COViD-19 in place, we miss seeing the rest of the staff.
__label__1	If you want a place for over service and not a very friendly service then this is your place to be. I asked a server how much my friend had to drink (since he was sent to hospital) and said they would find out. 15 minutes waiting still nothing. I can tell they don't care about their liquor license. Great place for the liquor control board to investigate. Seemed like a great hangout but when you don't care about your customers you serve then probably not a place that should be in business if you're affecting the welfare & Safety of the public.
__label__1	This place is  sorry excuse for a Bojangles place the chicken was old the manger was rude and disrespectful she almost give us biscuits that was hard as a rock we had to wait 30 mins for a remake chicken and biscuits but everything else was good never again visiting this place again
__label__5	Fantastic food for a chain. My kids even ate. I absolutely recommend this place to all. Great food and great for kids.
__label__5	I had another great meal here tonight calamari was awesome the portion was a little little. But I'm still very good the parmesan crusted Hogfish was very tasty and the Barbados ribs were good. I had the sangria which was tasty my date enjoyed her wine the food delivery room table was quick.
__label__4	"On a whim, we went to this place one night and it was a great surprise! If we could, we would give it 4.5 stars. 

Service was fantastic, friendly, and very fast. The food was great, especially the fried catfish tacos which was the special for the night! The Jumbalaya was good, but not the best we had in New Orleans. 

Would certainly recommend if you're in the neighborhood!"
__label__4	Good go to place for wings and chicken stringers (basically chicken fingers). Ordered the Hot and Honey Stringers, which came with 6 pieces. Good flavor and crispy breading and lots of sauce  They have a lot of menu options and prices are all under $20. Love the big screen TVs for game days!
__label__4	Tasty , fresh food, with plenty of seats, which is a great combination in this part of New Orleans. We did the taco sampler and each of the items were excellent. My son's meal, although for kids, was as large as any adult meal.
__label__3	The decor of this place was adorable, absolutely loved the uniqueness of it and bright colors. Unfortunately, my latte was not very good. I'm not sure if the milk used in it went sour but the latte definitely had a weird taste which was disappointing.
__label__2	at a comedy show right now and waiting for management to throw out the dumb, loud girl who has no respect for the comedians and the people who spent money to see them.
__label__3	We won't be back. The food was small and not out of the ordinary but I'll tell you what wasn't small. The cost. On a side note. Their burgers come with kettle chips. Not French fries. What gives. A hand full of cheap chips. We were very disappointed.
__label__5	"I could eat here a couple times a week. Food is made fresh to order and not overly salty. I loved the Thai chicken, kinda like sweet and sour but with a kick. Best thing was I ordered it to go and they gave me a separate container for the sauce so it didn't get soggy.
 Also ordered Muu Shoo pork which can be hard to find and it was doo good. The sauce was very flavorful. The Mongolian beef was great not overly salty like most. I will be back quite often"
__label__1	If I could this place zero stars I would. If you are a person of color please do yourself a favor and do not come here. Staff is super racist and will literally refuse you service.
__label__1	I would put 0 stars if this was an option.  I was extremely dissatisfied with the quality of the products I received.  I contacted customer service & they don't have an exchange policy.  They recommended that I sell these on a resell site.  This is the worst customer experience I've every heard of.
__label__1	Make sure you check the work of the employees inside and out.  The interior of my car was my touched by anything but a vacuum and had to ask them to clean it.  Will not return!
__label__5	Boutique clothing store with name brand options in tops, jeans, shoes, etc., and a plethora of dress options for special events, including prom, weddings, black tie events, and cocktail parties. Great customer service, plenty of parking, reasonable prices. So happy I found this hidden gem!
__label__4	"We chose this spot because it is close to us and the service has been great. We generally just get our meds here but occasionally we will get a snack/drinks, otc meds, sunblock, etc.

The items here vary from makeup, toys, toiletries,  gift cards, as seen on tv, and seasonal things.

My favorite part of this CVS is that there is a drive-thru for prescription drop offs and pickups. The pharmacists are kind, helpful and send text alerts when your scripts are ready."
__label__1	I ordered the chicken kabob and ground sirloin kabob plate. After eating half of the sirloin kabob i noticed some pink on the inside. Opening the kabob up i found the entire inside to be COMPLETELY RAW. I am absolutely disgusted and will not be returning to this restaurant.
__label__3	Decent hotel--clean, quiet.  Great location with tons within walking distance.  The rooms are a decent size, but the bathrooms are tiny.  I honestly dont believe that someone who isnt an average size (height or weight) would feel comfortable using the restroom.  There was no counter space on which to place a toiletry bag, nor large enough space on the tiny mantle-like area under the mirror.  The grout showed vestiges of mold and the curtain rod was rusty.  Not bad, but some room for improvement.
__label__5	Outstanding meal. 4 different entrees, salads, soups, desserts, wine, beer ... all couldn't have been more tasty.  Good prices, great menu, very friendly, low keyed and the BEST in Boise! There is no comparison to the quality and taste of their food compared to Gino's.
__label__4	Pizza is great. Vodka penne is excellent and I like their salads. Gluten Free pizza is good as well.
__label__2	The owner is the rudest guy in the all Entire universe. The food is frozen, not fresh. A lot of customers complained about his attitude. He had only one cook at Ardmore location , he end up by shutting it down . Same thing will happen to the new place
__label__5	Fabulous  Sangria! Great chips and very flavorful salsa! My chimichanga was excellent! The service was very quick and pleasant. This location has been several different concepts - all ok but nothing great. This is really good Tex mex - I hope they make it! Based on my experience- they should!
__label__4	The food at Vincent's is always great and the service is stellar.  My only complaint is the parking at the St. Charles location is not good but the food and service well make up for that.
__label__5	Excellent Service. They guys were great! I highly recommend! They were on time and handled everything professionally.
__label__1	Called to see the wait time, was told absolutely NOTHING about making an appointment. I didn't know they could take them over the phone (obviously calling for wait time I would have happily appreciated the option to make an appointment) left after being told to go pick up over the counter medication, which is completely fine, but because I did not make an appointment I paid over $160 for them to tell me to go to CVS. This staff is ridiculously ignorant in customer service.
__label__1	I have never had an issue with this bank until they put in some fancy atm in their lobby. Now every time I come in to simply get change its a  30 minute wait because they only have 1 teller behind the counter. It was far better without the fancy machine.
__label__1	Not very effective at killing weeds or growing grass.  I trusted them with my lawn management and they didn't come throw.  Final straw was paying for aeration and seeding and they only seeded.  I cancelled service and they keep coming and billing me.  PLENTY of better options; including your local Lowe's, Home Depot or anywhere else you can buy supplies.  Stay away.
__label__5	"I just love this salon.

1.  Richard is an amazing stylist.  He never pushes me to do too much to my hair and he actually has opinions on what to do.  Plus he is always right.  He does stylish but timeless cuts that meet my needs.

2.  Kathy is the best waxer in the city!  Love her work."
__label__5	This Midas is fantastic!  Super friendly and fair employees who won't charge your socks off even when they can probably get away with it.  I will definitely bring my car back in the future when it needs service.  Highly recommend this place.
__label__3	Love the beer and the atmosphere. Burgers were so/so  but getting/paying my tab took forever. They need to seperate 'order' line from 'pay' line.
__label__3	"My plane just touched down and the rear end started fishtailing as if the pilot were power sliding in Fast & the Furious. Well, any landing you can walk away from is a good one, and I wanted to go celebrate at the nearest bar.

Jack's was pretty crowded too as if people were coming to the airport for happy hour. The best thing was the price. I was expecting $10 drinks since it's a bar in an airport, but my 2 blue moons were $10. Excellent! Unfortunately, I couldn't stay and cause trouble since my connecting flight was boarding."
__label__5	This is our favorite pizza place in Fishhawk.  Not only is the pizza delicious (and I'm from Chicago, so I'm very jiffy about pizza) but the place is managed brilliantly.  Kudos to the owners!
__label__3	"I met friends for brunch in mid-August.  The place was nice, and the food was fantastic.  Our server was awful.  Every time we wanted anything, we had to find her, (she stayed at the server's station on her phone).  We had to search for her when we wanted to order.  We had to send someone to find  her every time we wanted a refill on coffee / drinks.  Not once did she come to our table of her own accord.

Everything else was good, so I would be willing to try it again.  Hopefully our server was an exception and not the rule."
__label__5	I just love this place! They are so kind and do an incredibly wonderful job. They take their time and don't rush you like so many other nail salons. I live very far north but make the drive just to come here!!
__label__3	Overall food here is tasteless. The rice ball in a wine soup is very watery. For spicy food, I would recommend Jane G's in center city, much more authentic.
__label__5	The food is delicious and the portions are huge! I heard they are consistent in their prices and quantities so i will definitely be back. The Bandeja Paisa and Sancocho was exquisite. My husband loved it too. The fruit juices are also really good.
__label__5	Without a doubt our favorite place to visit when we are in Santa Barbara.  We always make a point to get some and take home and freeze.  Not only are the spudnuts delicious the people that work there are friendly and nice. They always remember us.
__label__4	Very good. Worth a short wait. Looks like regular clients that value their little something extra.
__label__2	Usually this place is pretty good,  but lunch this week was disappointing.  Arugula and prosciutto  on Flatbread were off, and chicken on Cobb  salad was spongey. We will try them again- maybe it was just a bad day. Waitress  was very nice, and soups were good.
__label__2	It's a BWW.   And not a particularly good one either.  The food is pretty standard BWW fare, but the service is pretty awful.   The servers are more intent on hearing the latest gossip than waiting tables.
__label__5	I was amazed, I decided to try this place and was surprised. I had the volcano which was delicious and the delirium roll. This second roll was to die for, i would definitely recommend it. I loved the miso soup, it was delicious!
__label__1	I went in this morning to have blood taken for a test. Within 10 minutes of leaving I had a burning itching pain on my arm where they had the tape.  The pain was so extreme that I had to stop my car and rip off the bandage. When I attempted to call to find out what they put on me they gave me this rash, I couldn't reach anybody either at the store front or at national customer service. I have never been allergic to adhesive or latex in the past so I'm curious what in gods name are using over there.
__label__3	This is one of my favorite places to eat unfortunately this time around the service was a little slow I will try it again at a later date to see if this improves.
__label__4	Breakfast is yummy yummy yummy!  Has a great family feel and the service is always excellent.  My husband loves the gyro omlette.
__label__5	I'm going with all five here like some of the others.  Great Thai food, EXCELLENT jasmine green tea!! ...and it's BYOB (although I had none to bring).  I'd def say if in Philly and looking for some good Thai food with a nice atmosphere this should be a go to spot.  Not to mention it's location is great and you can walk somewhere else for a good drink or something.
__label__5	Yes! Love this place! The pizzas, the mood, the people. Makes it feel very city like, very New York/San Francisco. The pizza are fancy, original and flavorful. Will be back. Also, next time I'll have to try the bread, it was sold out this time.
__label__5	Blk mkt is my go to Poke place. Love their generously sized bowls with the combination of fresh ingredients they use!
__label__5	"Dr. Lokesh, is a top doctor for my little girl. My little girl, has Special needs due to Cerebral Palsy ( CP ). Dr. Lokesh goes above and beyond to assist her in managing her multiple conditions. He explains his diagnosis and treatment plans so her mother and myself understand. Great doctor, I recommend him to everyone that is a little more protective of their children like myself. 
Jon P."
__label__2	I order the combination fried rice most likely the onion fried rice. I had more onions then meat in the rice. I thought this place would actually taste like authentic Chinese food but it didn't. The rice didn't taste like nothing at all, if it wasn't for the duck sauce i would of have gave a 1 star rate. I'm very disappointed.
__label__5	"Went here on a food tour.... do yourself
A favor a go here. The grapefruit vodka drink was a must!! All the food was on point!"
__label__4	My first time to this restaurant. Sat on the 2nd floor at the bar which was really nice. Great bartender, Phoebe was serving lunch. Food was very good but pricey. Happy Hour drinks were a good value.
__label__5	I could not recommend this place enough. I took my rabbit to see Dr. Balzer to get spayed. The consultation was very informative and the surgery went very well. I was also given a lot of information on aftercare and how to administer medications. The price was much much more reasonable than other vets in the area. I will definitely be back!
__label__4	A great place for quick and easy Thai. All the dishes are Thai with an American feel. To go orders they cut holes in the boxes so the food stays fresh. Open on Sunday can't go wrong
__label__5	Wow these guys are awesome. Greatest arcade in Tennessee, no contest. Even sold me arcade parts. Very helpful will be going back.
__label__5	I would eat here every week if I lived in the area!  Stopped by traveling north for a little Cinco de Mayo fare.  It was like being inMexico--even better!  I had shrimp tacos with fresh mango salsa, beans & rice.  My husband had chicken fajitas which he enjoyed.  And, the Margaritas were the best!  We will definitely stop again! Yum!
__label__3	If you're looking for a sandwich as big as your torso, look no further: they are all at 4th Street Deli. They are really good, even if you have to dislocate your jaw to eat one. Soups are good, too, although with everything here it's good to have some salt on hand because I find things sometimes under-seasoned. Better than the alternative, though. Place offers quick take-out but no delivery. Hours are phenomenal -- Philly restaurants, take note!
__label__2	Went there once and they were out of rabies vaccinations. Also, the boarded up windows are a total eyesore! They should have more pride in their business.
__label__4	deeelicious way to linger over dinner with a good friend or date or parent for 2 hours. my 1 girlfriend and i split bread w/ mozz, baked brie, spinach salad, and stuffed bell pepper. the atmosphere and mood is calming. the server, philip, was attentive and funny and helpful. the food wasnt anything too crazy creative but it was comforting and simply tasty. would like to see more flavors and exotic combinations.
__label__2	It's a nice place with really good coffee. however the eggs and the bacon on the breakfast sandwich were not made to order, it's very expensive, and the girl at the cash register is very rude.
__label__5	This is one of the best restaurants/night club to come to Edmonton in a long time!  It gives off an old Mexico meets modern chic feel. Tacos are amazing and drinks are mostly tequila obviously. They even serve large size coronas on a brown paper bag. Downstairs is the night club. On the night we went they had a really good DJ. I would definitely go back.
__label__1	The condo complex I lived in is managed by Bidegain, and today I called them about someone took my covered parking spot (I'm sure everyone understand how important it is in Tucson in the summer) The agents I spoke to are unbelievably rude and hung up on me twice! I hope people who are thinking about doing business with them would think twice. Hope this helps.
__label__4	Had a great breakfast here yesterday! Eggs over easy, perfectly grilled sausage, and delicious home fries and an omelette, home fries, and a side of bacon. Service was fast and friendly. Coffee was hot and delicious. table next to is ordered the Heart Attack Special, an omelette brimming with bacon, ham, sausage and scrapple. It looked delicious, but I couldn't bring myself to order something by that name! They also had a stack of pancakes that l will definitely get next time. Breakfast for two cost $13 - can't complain about that!
__label__5	"Food was yummy. Place is popular. Wait wasn't too bad for a Sunday morning. My husband likes the frittata. Fruit cup was fresh. Tried grilled muffin. I ordered chocolate chip, but got corn bread by mistake. I got it to go and didn't realize until I was at the convention. But it was still tasty. I'll have to try the chocolate chip next time we are around for a show. 

It's only about 8 mins from the Greater Philadelphia Convention Center. So very convenient for attendees and vendors."
__label__5	I have been going to Dr. Goldberg et al for probably twenty years. I have always been well taken care of, treated with the utmost respect, and received great care. It was not until I went to another dermatologist in another state and was told they couldn't help my sun spots, seriously, that I realized how up to date and professional Pima is. Also, Lynne is the best and has kept my skin looking great. I still won't let anyone else touch my skin and schedule my trips home around seeing her.
__label__5	Amazing bbq! If you're local this is a must try! Great hospitality, staff was knowledgeable on what they served and gave great pairing recommendations, and they also offer a first responder discount.
__label__5	Went there for the first time last weekend. Everything was delicious! The omelette was extreme fluffy and our waitress, Whitney, was so fun and helpful!
__label__1	somewhat standoff-ish staff that talks crap about you right after you walk out the door...not the most knowledgeable about skin care either.  next time i'll buy online.
__label__4	I have only had Indian food once before, so I am no expert. But the chicken makhani was Delish!! Also really liked the samosas.
__label__1	Never ever rent from them. They are ver kind before you rent after you rent it they change the attitude. Don't rent from them.
__label__3	"PROS:
n/a 

CONS:
- Corned Beef Hash was a bit dry
- Crowded

This place is a normal diner and the food that I tried was normal as well.

Corned Beef Hash - had good flavor but was a bit on the dry side."
__label__5	The Yard House, like the nearby Kona Grill, is one of those places that you can visit and know that your food will be good no matter what you order.
__label__5	"Incredible. Flat out, incredible. I have been waiting for something like this to open up in Nashville for years. Let me preface this review with the fact that I have NEVER reviewed any place/restaurant. However, after going there today, I felt obligated to post a review. Extremely friendly staff, clean place, cool atmosphere, reasonable prices and great food. Finally, a filling, healthy and reasonably priced meal.

As an investor, I really see great value in this up and coming franchise. This place is sure to be a huge hit in Nashville and wherever they might expand."
__label__5	My mother and I had our hair styled and pinned for a wedding with Carlyle. My mother had the utmost blast with her hairstylist - chatting away the whole time. And we both came out of it with impressive hair that stood up to a day of outdoor activities. While they might not be crazy cheap, I think they're def worth it!
__label__4	"Like their selection (specially high end brands of
Purses) BUT it is VERY messy specially in the home accessories area. Cashier in my case seemed very inexperienced and had to count with her fingers? Idk what was going on to be honest...."
__label__5	"I recently moved to the area so I'm checking out the pizza places to see which one has the best pizza and so far La Famiglia is my favorite. 

It has a good crust nice cheese good sauce cooked well. The place is clean,  they deliver like they said they would, on-time. It all adds up to a great place so far.

I'm actually tempted to stop my search but since I've just begun I'll keep looking but so far so good. Give La Famiglia a try."
__label__5	"I too, took both my cars for state inspection and emissions one day last week. On the same day they were ready
In a timely matter. I'm looking for a shop that's professional and fair. Joe & Sons has this and now he's earned my trust.
It's a great way to support our local businesses.

Wm. K."
__label__5	Three years ago Javier and his men repaired an old fence in our backyard and built a new redwood fence on our side yard.  Soon after the new fence was built we had at least a dozen neighbors compliment us on how good it looked, and to this day we still get inquiries about who built it.  The repaired fence is still holding up well.  Javier was great to work with and we highly recommend Los Padres Fence!
__label__4	"Most people know about 45's half price sushi on Sunday's, but I would love to recommend their half price cocktails and martinis on Thursday. They have a wide selection of fun, fruity drinks to choose from and a seasonal drink menu as well. 

My favorite cocktail is The Zen and favorite martini is Blonde Moment."
__label__5	Best shaved ice! Has the consistency of snow.  So many flavors to choose from! My favorite is the pink lemonade with tropical creme.
__label__4	We enjoyed our experience at Mr. An's. We ate sushi rolls in the bar during happy hour. It was busy. Mr. An thanked us personally for coming in.  The sushi was excellent, which surprised me since we are in the middle of a dessert.
__label__5	My friend really likes its Tom Yong Kung soup. Remember ordering it in hot pot with shrimp!
__label__3	"I've only been here once so maybe I don't know a whole lot about this place, but when I went it was for a bachelorette party. My friend really wanted to go up on the stage, but she couldn't because we didn't give the singer/piano player $20...boooo...it was busy that night, but still. She was dissapointed. 

I realize this is a fun place otherwise, however, and give it credit for that. It is entertaining."
__label__5	Food was Amazing we tried a little of everything it was All Soo Yummy,,,can't wait to go back! My husband was so pleased he gave waiter $30 tip!!
__label__1	"Tried to be forthcoming in the review that I sent before. There really isn't nothing to put here, considering anything you put in this country nowadays, gets censored, and/or deleted. That's politics for you. Back to my review of the buffet.
The bottom line:
The Buffay is not open for public use. I asked personally when it would be available to open, and was given a half, snarled, sarcastic response to me.
That is the beginning and the end of the story."
__label__4	This is a large super Wawa located on route 30 in Barrington. It's on the east side of 295 and on the south side of Route 30. It is your classic super Wawa with the big store and many pumps.  However you cannot enter from route 30.   The entrance driveway is actually located behind the store. There's a service road that you have to turn into either right before or right after the store itself. Very strange but it works. This is probably why the gas here was five cents cheaper than the other super Wawas in the area.
__label__1	Over priced on everything and super smokey, no ventilation. Music was not bad and karaoke was ok. I will not be going back any time soon.
__label__4	The food was good. We had the shrimp and grits with sausage and the roasted chicken. The cocktails were also tasty. The service, however, was not great. The waiters split our table (2 waiters). At one point, it took over 20 minutes for one of them to check on us, so long that we opted out of dessert due to the excessive wait. Wish I could have given five stars, but the service needs some work.
__label__5	One of my favorite bars in Nashville! The bartenders are so friendly and really know their drinks! Not to mention they have some of the best live music downtown!  I ALWAYS stop by Silver Dollar whenever I'm downtown!
__label__2	"Average. Nothing  special.

Over priced salad and burgers. Very loud.

If you want to drink...ok. To eat...you can do a lot better."
__label__5	"Colombre coffee = yes. 

I got eggs benedict with the turkey bacon. Exactly what a egg benedict should be. Also got the whole wheat pancakes. SO SO SO GOOD. You don't even need a lot of syrup or butter!!
Friend got lox eggs benedict. Still, very delicious. 

Great go to for brunch or any meal of the day. 

Pros: intimate seating, close to Rittenhouse,coffee and service. 
Cons: small, easily crowded"
__label__5	"Our favorite place to shop in east St. Pete - solid organic selection and good produce. 

Not a ton of cheese and cured meat but it makes up for it with an INCREDIBLE bulk section and deli. 

The bacon is amazing and the checkers are always friendly."
__label__3	"Visited on a Saturday night for late dinner. The decor is modern and the restaurant has low lighting, it definitely sets the mood for an intimate dining experience. 
I had the Lobster BLT - the sandwich had lobster pieces sprinkled on the top and tomato in the center. I felt cheated as the sandwich was 50% bread, 20% lobster and 30% tomatoes. I also had the brussel sprouts which had a great flavor and chunks of bacon. The server great and  helpful. As for cocktails the Old fashioned is one of the best in the city."
__label__4	"We came for Brunch yesterday, the food was Excellent! I ordered the Bayou breakfast! Very good! 

The only complaint is when we were waiting for our food I saw the waitress take a presumably dirty glass with lipstick on it, wipe it off and serve someone coffee in it. So we happy to be drinking mimosas out of plastic cups at that point. 

Other than that the food was great, atmosphere is nice. I wouldn't absolutely come back and recommend it to anyone."
__label__2	Horrible service I came in an hour before my appointment and it took an hour to get anyone to talk to me just to get my car serviced. Seems they only care to help people with more expensive vehicles like tundras and Tacoma's. So of you drive a Corolla just go else where.
__label__5	The hummus platter is amazing - the hummus is smooth, the pita is warm and soft, and the veggies (onion, carrot, celery, olives) are crispy fresh. I personally love the greek salad - huge serving and will fill you up quickly. The gyro is stuffed to the brim. Can't say anything about the hookah, but the food and the ambiance is most excellent!
__label__4	Good beer. Yes. I tried them all. I would have gone 5 stars, but I'm not down with being served beer in a plastic cup when I'm at the bar. Had the hummus and veggies- also good but I don't think they used any tahini. BUT they get points for giving me raw zucchini and spring onions. GREAT lady bartender the first two times. Not so great one the third time... and I didn't like the male manager at all. Worth a stop if you're trapped in downtown INDY.
__label__4	"We ate here last night for my buddy's 40th BDay.  I was a little nervous as our other friend showed up late and said the cab driver told him this place was owned by Sizzler and it was the same food but double the price.  That alone talked me out of the prime rib which it shouldn't have.

I ended up getting the 12oz Ribeye with garlic mash & veggies.  My steak was really good and had tons of flavor.  My wife had a filet oscar style and enjoyed that as well.  We would eat here again in Reno."
__label__5	I got the half po' boy and shrimp gumbo special, it was delicious!!  The portions are huge, it was more than I could eat. The place was busy, but the service was extremely quick. All the employees were incredibly nice, service was excellent! I can't wait to come back.
__label__2	Sat outside by myself,and waited while everyone else was being waited on,I finely had to grab the attention of on of the waiters after sitting there for 20 mins being ignored. I will think twice before coming here again.
__label__5	Checked this place out tonight for the first time. If you like wings you won't be disappointed. The wings and thighs had just the right amount of spice and smokiness. I thought I might be disappointed by not having any dipping sauce like ranch or blue cheese. Neither are necessary. The only side is a cilantro flavored cole slaw. It wasn't my favorite, though it wasn't bad. Glad I stopped in on this trip to Nashville.
__label__3	"One of my go to Asian food spots in Reno.  Solid restaurant and great prices.  Yes, it's not the ""best"" but what do you expect for 10- 11 dollars?  Good, quality Vietnamese food.

The imperial rolls are crunchy and hot.  The fried wonton soup is really good.  The pho, Bun rieu, and bun Bo hue warms the soul.

Bonus:  If you are a Costco member, they give you 10% off!"
__label__5	Beautiful coffee shop with very unique tables all individual works of art! The staff is friendly and attentive. The coffee and pastries are top quality! I go there on a regular basis.
__label__5	"This Hallmark store is INCREDIBLE!!
There are so many unique things available to purchase and the staff is so courteous and friendly. I love buying Birthday gifts for people here. The store is forever changing the products available which makes for a fun shopping experience. My all time favorite time of the year to visit is during the Christmas season....WOW is the word that comes to mind. Thanks for such an incredible experience at each visit!!!"
__label__5	Really cool little wine bar in a really cool town!  The bartender here was really nice and attentive.  They have a surprisingly large bottled beer selection as well.  I'm not a big wine drinker so I was happy to find a couple of beers that I loved!  Only downside is they don't have a bathroom but the restaurant next door allows people to use theirs.  A handful of tables are outside which is the perfect place to sit on a cool evening.  Definitely a place to check out when in Ybor City!
__label__1	"We are in a party of 15 to celebrate a friend's birthday party . After consuming beers , dinners , spirits and stuff , we asked the server ""Tim"" to clean up our table so we can bring the cake and celebrate and he just walk away . Then we asked again and he says he is too busy to clean up the table. They should have a customer service training so their team better service its clients ."
__label__1	Order my Ch steak wit cook Green Peppers  earlier today i was about to dig in open it up NOT WHAT I ORDERED this is the second time they got my order wrong 1st time i got someone else food. Im ordering around noon what's the problem to top it off i have no way of taking it back $10 lost wont be ordering again. Steaks are good if your order is right. Damn
__label__5	Family and I had a great time. The guys that played were funny and talented. The only draw back was trying to find the place.
__label__5	Some of the best falafel I've had. I love this place and have been coming for many years. Wonderful food, wonderful owners, and the price is excellent.
__label__4	"truck rental for my move.  cheapest truck rental in reno. simple easy friendly and no wait on pick up or return.  they have a small coffee shop attached as well so i got a chai tee as i took care of paperwork too; and due to credit card terminal issues ended up getting the chai for free!!  

this was the second time ive used this place and if i need a truck again ill use them yet again"
__label__5	Great place.  These people know their shoes.  I was very happy with my purchase and the service was excellent!  They have some pretty nice technology to help determine which shoes you might need.  Staff is extremely patient and kind.
__label__5	"Loved the coffeeshop at the corner, which was a great place to wait to get to the restaurant.

The food was amazing."
__label__4	Super happy with Choice Greens! Great salads, sandwiches and panini's. The salads are large enough for 2 meals; I can never finish in just one sitting. The staff is friendly and helpful and the restaurant is clean, clean, clean! Bit pricey, which is the reason for a 4, but other than that its a must go for salad joints! Tip: parking sucks since it's in the Trader Joes lot!
__label__5	Love this place, atmosphere is cool, great customer service, and delicious ass food! You can dine in (indoor & outside seating) or take out either way you can't go wrong. They have a taste of Puerto rican, Dominican, and Cuban food. You can bring your own beer/liquor, or enjoy there slushees. The location is very convenient, you can walk, ride bike, drive and or take public transportation. If you are in the Lafayette area definitely stop by!
__label__4	After hearing about this restaurant from coworkers, my husband and I decided to try it. and I am happy that we did.  We arrived about 530 and were seated immediately.  The service was great and the food we loved it.  I hope they put a Chedders on the Southside otherwise we will be making the drive West.
__label__5	This is the spot hands down. I've dealt with diabetes and they are the only spot that has sugar free ice cream. They are amazing!!!!!!!!
__label__4	Great drink prices and friendly staff.  Cheap food that has never disappointed me - definitely get the fries! Just a nice little corner bar in Soulard - definitely check it out next time you're looking for a place to go but don't want to deal with the crowds at other bars in the area!
__label__4	"Do you like slushies? Milkshakes? Irish coffee?
Have you ever had all of those rolled into one?

No?

Then go to Erin Rose.
This is seriously the most amazing thing ever. Sure, it comes out of a machine, and I'm sure that you don't want to know how the damn thing's made, but one sip and you won't care. It's boozy milkshake crack.

Also, fantastic jukebox, giant f'ing po'boys in the back, and a passable whiskey selection.

Pretty damn good dive bar."
__label__5	Probably 4 1/2 stars but I'll round up :) they have all you need and are open late! Staff is very helpful and typically a great selection
__label__5	They all have the best customer service... which is key to making any customer return. Everyone is so nice and friendly. I had a manicure by Josie today and she was great. I felt like she really took her time! Love how my nails turned out. The facility is also so nice and clean. Prime location in downtown St Pete, too. Can't wait to go back!
__label__1	I would like to write a review but we actually never received our food. We left about an hour and 15 minutes (and several cocktails) after we ordered.
__label__4	"+1 on the Staff meal ; seems like everyone enjoyed it. Fried tomatoes were good, but not out-of-this-world. As was the pizza.. err ""flatbread"" if we're to use the restaurant's terminology.

They have a good concept of farm-to-table, and you can peruse through the ruffage ostentatiously displayed in the main dining area. I don't think anyone can go wrong eating here."
__label__1	This place is just horrible, the food my be good but the service is so bad good food can't save it. There is always a problem getting your order and more than half the time when you do finally get it,its not right anyway. I miss the old small store and will no longer bother even trying to go this new location.
__label__5	I love all the girls that work here. I've been going to Kim for a little over a year and have never been disappointed. They listen to what you want and they are very creative. Very friendly girls, I highly recommend them!
__label__5	"Attention MEN!  Christy is awesome.  Totally low ""drama"" and high results.  NO BS.  She makes suggestions AND THEY WORK!  

I thought I'd have to get a face lift to correct bags under my eyes, drooping ""smile"" and just crappy old looking skin.  NOT SO!  

Christy has the experience (years!) to know what gives maximum bang for the buck-- without going overboard.  

Look for her specials-- GREAT Value even w/out these."
__label__5	I have never tried this type of food and I must say, I was wowed by the flavors and the service. The Bar tender recommended we tried the Lamb Tiki Masala and so we did. I gotta say its my new favorite dish! Also the Drinks were very well made. The ambiance, service, food, drinks  and the Bartender were all unexpectedly Fantastic. I hope to go again sometime soon. Price for the serving portions was fair, we did not have any reservations and we ate at the Bar which was different for me but actually worked well for my party of 4.
__label__3	I've found that I somehow end up here every Christmas. And I don't even drink. This is definitely a place that gets packed but is great for people watching. Drink seem reasonably priced.
__label__4	Lots of delicious veggie options like falafel sliders, veggie pot pie, french toast.  HAvent been back since my switch to vegan, but think it would still work pretty well.  Also, they have cool art shows at times, including the one I went to where they destroyed art based on audience participation.  Cool spot, laid back.
__label__5	Well, I flat out love this place! Was in Philly for several days for a conference and I ate at The Original Turkey three times - no shame in my game! I love turkey but it is rare to find good turkey outside of the home- cooked Thanksgiving turkey. I went straight up turkey, dressing and corn and was not disappointed. Turkey was super moist, corn was deliciously buttery and the dressing was just like Mom makes. Am sad to leave Philly and The Original Turkey!
__label__5	We were visiting Lake Tahoe with a stop in Reno and thoroughly enjoyed the dinner experience at Bimini Steakhouse.  It was our 30th annivesary weekend and the staff and waitress made it extra special for us. The filet mignon was wonderful. Highly recommend!
__label__5	Great local shop specializing in screen prints showcasing the different diverse neighborhoods in St. Louis. I had shirts made there years ago when I lived in South City and returned this time for a new Maplewood shirt and even a onesie to celebrate my new STL baby. They print them in 10 minutes and have a lot of different colors and styles to choose from in the $20-30 range. They also sell stickers, city maps, books, all things St. Louis. It's a great way to showcase your neighborhood or buy a gift for a friend!
__label__5	I have driven past this place several times but have never eaten here, today was my first pizza and wow! It is a great pizza for 8 bucks. I would highly recommend trying Blues Fired Pizza!
__label__5	This is a very unique hotel and one of the best that I've stayed in in Nashville. They called a van taxi for us to take us down to the downtown bars. They were more than helpful on anything we needed. They do offer yelp specials every once in awhile. A nice place and only $20 ride from the bars.
__label__5	Holy Moly is this place terrific!  Tried the crab cakes and the black beans and rice. Terrific. Service was outstanding and the owner stopped by to check on us. The seafood nachos are also awesome!! loved this place!
__label__5	"Though I've resided just short of a mile out from South Philly, only recently did I discover what I can only describe as the best pizza on the planet. 

Their classic tomato pie with mozzarella baked underneath the sauce is indescribable. 

This old Italian gem reigns in a good crowd of South Philly veterans that serve as great entertainment for tourists to the city.

Can't go wrong here. Fan for life."
__label__3	Freindly staff and large portions for the price. Been there twice and cant really say i loved or hated anything. Food is very average but the corn bread is very good. Other then that i can say the place is bad or good, just average. Steak is very plain ribs arent Baby backs so not much meat and the bbq sauce is average, So i guess all im really saying is A-OK.
__label__5	Excellent gyro supreme, the fries where fresh and the service was extremely friendly. I stop here for lunch everytime I'm in the neighborhood
__label__5	"I told the guy I was a fan of Popeyes and heard this was great fried chicken. Drove 25 min to try it. He gave me a drumstick to try while he bagged my 9 piece for $8.89. I loved it! The season they use is delicious! 
I have to admit this place gives Popeye's a run for their money!
Oh and definitely try the beef patties! They are flakey and delicious!"
__label__5	Coach Terry  and Coach Pregon have been awesome with my son. We have only been attending lessons briefly at All Star Performance, but his baseball coach has already commented on the improved mechanics he has demonstrated in practice. Thanks Coaches!
__label__5	We stopped in for breakfast before heading to a long beach day. The food was excellent, the service was superb, and the restrooms were even clean! This is a must stop for breakfast. We had the biscuit and gravy with eggs. You could tell the gravy and biscuits were homemade--a nice surprise and a treat! We also got the Tin Can Wild. The pancakes were so fluffy and tasty! Service was also fast without making you feel rushed. Again, a must stop breakfast spot!
__label__1	My apartment is literally 130 years old yet UPS can't find it. I live by the street sign and the UPS truck is always parked in the bicycle lane but still no luck getting packages from them.
__label__5	Stumbled upon this gem of a beach during a recent visit to UCSB. We were traveling with our dog, and we were looking for an interesting dog-friendly place to take him to play. Arroyo Burro Beach worked well for all of us. Clean beach and well-behaved dogs (and their owners). We went back later and ate at the one restaurant on the beach. My dog and I both give this place two thumbs up :)
__label__5	I have bought a few Ball watches from Jared (who I believe is the assistant manager). He is very knowledgeable, helpful and calls when he says he's going to call. He is currently helping me with a warranty issue and keeps me in the loop with what's going on with the manufacturer.  I have bought other jewelery there from various staff members and all have been very attentive and professional. I'd recommend shopping here to anyone. Just great!
__label__4	Just moved back to NOLA in this neighborhood and had to start trying out the local restaurants.  LOVE the pizza here.  We got the 5 cheese pizza and added pepperoni, yum but beware if you don't like greasy pizza you may not like this one.  I happen to be a fan of NY style pizza and they do the pizza well.  It is also a good portion on the large.  Also have to say reconnected with an old friend there that I had not seen since before Katrina.  Go Peggy (waitress) still the best in service and conversation.
__label__5	This plays rocks! OMG!!! The BBQ is the best this side of the Mississippi and I knows BBQ! Melanie, our server was not only cute but smart and did not steer us wrong! For a CUBS FAN in CARDINAL territory I'm coming back! Ask for MELANIE - seriously she knows the beer and food.
__label__4	Such a great little restaurant by the beach! The aura is fantastic and the service is really good. We ordered an omelet filled with ham, turkey, and cheese with a side of fresh fruit and potatoes, a falafel wrap and french onion soup. The omelet and falafel were cooked perfect and tasted really, really good. However, the french onion soup was a let down. It looked perfect from the outside however, the taste was too sweet and the cheese was way too difficult to chew. Next time I will order something other than the soup but, I will definitely be back!
__label__4	I love the rink and always go there with friends. Great music and crowd, wonderful view. I just wish there are more selections of good and drinks.
__label__4	This place always seems to have a great selection of fresh produce and the staff have always been friendly as well.
__label__2	"The place is really nice but the potion of food we got was way too small. I had pasta. Our server was too busy talking to every guy that walked in instead of paying attention to us. We didn't even have silverware we waited a good 5 minutes for the waitress and finally walked over to the bar to get silverware ourselves. 

Our waitress: she needed to stop chasing after guys and pay attention to her guests. She was not familiar with the menu either."
__label__2	"Concept is good
Service is not
No ownership from servers
Tipping before meal is complete is dump
No salt n pepper, ketchup, hot sauce n no one to talk to to get it"
__label__4	Yes its outdated and doesn't have a pool or mini fridge, but their hospitality is outstanding. We had a great check in experience and the staff in the casino and restaurants were wonderful. If the beds were a little higher quality I could have stayed a few more nights. Definitely a better family getaway than couples retreat. By the way, I was nervous about cleanliness after reading the other reviews. But the newer tower rooms were fine!
__label__5	Would recommend for anyone looking for something different and fun to do. Sal is an expert at his craft and a great teacher. Had so much fun we love the glass pieces we made.
__label__5	My 5 star review is not just for the awesome food but also the amazing things that the owner of everest does within the community like chronic disease screenings. A great STL staple that really gives to the community!
__label__4	Great beer selection. Upgraded menu for a pub. Great patio even on a chilly day. Our server was friendly and efficient.
__label__5	LOVE IT HERE. We have all our children's parties here. Also love coming around for the holidays. Staff is very nice and personable m. I think it's very reasonably priced compared to the movies and sesame place. Great food if your hanging all day and want to get lunch! Chicken salad is awesome! Just a  good time all around.
__label__5	"I met a girlfriend here for a beer and bite to eat in the afternoon while we catch up. I had never been and she chose it so I was excited! I love trying new places!
Our bartender was attentive enough and told us a lot about the restaurant and the change of atmospheres between day and night. We were there in a quiet afternoon, where we had the bar top to ourselves, but at night it fills up and they have an outside beer garden!
I ordered the vegan pizza and devoured it with an IPA. A killer combo! I will certainly be back!"
__label__5	I am so impressed with Sharon. I had a massage yesterday and she really spent a lot of time working on my problem areas. I came out feeling so refreshed. She is AMAZING!! I cannot wait to go back. The establishment was clean, quiet, and very professional. You will not be disappointed.
__label__1	No ice cream no cookies, service is tired af. All on a nice Sunday afternoon. Just shut it down folks
__label__5	Dollar loan center is the best,  Sabrina was awesome and the other staff were friendly.  My credit isn't the best and dollar loan center was there when I was in need for some quick cash!! I would recommend dollar loan center over any other payday loan place!!
__label__5	We ordered from here for the first time last week and now we are hooked! We all got something different from each other and we all really liked what we got. I got the seafood ramen, omg yum! It was so good I might not be able to order anything different next time lol.
__label__5	This place is a must while visiting Boise. Strangers at the table next to us bought us the butterscotch pudding and it was the most delicious dessert I've ever had. Additionally, the pizza was great. Not usually a crust guy, but theirs was delicious. Lastly, their ranch dressing was the best I've ever had.
__label__5	"One of the greatest local cafes in town. Was so impressed by the spread of options and love that everything is local organic. I feel good eating the food and supporting the local business.
I got the tomato soup which was incredible! Will be back."
__label__3	Food is good I wish the salad bar was bigger. Meat is seasoned very well and wait staff are nice. Come with appetite and make a reservation
__label__4	Great spot - would love more chicken/vegetarian options! Make sure to make a reservation!
__label__5	They showed up promptly at the scheduled time and worked non stop for 4.5 hours. My kitchen and bathrooms have never been cleaner! Will definitely be using them again!
__label__4	I really like this spot. The atmosphere is homey, family and friends oriented. The owner is super friendly. My wife and I agree that the coffee is about the best in St. Louis. They use Mississippi Mud beans and know what to do with them.  I like the international flair, including decoupage tables of international travel. Lots of good baked goods, and they have just added a gelato cart -- we haven't tried it yet, but it looks good. A great little place to relax.
__label__5	I've been getting food here for about 8 years, and it's consistently been the best Pad Thai I've ever had in my life. Seriously!
__label__5	Well above average.  Friendly staff and great food.  Carna asada tacos where on point!
__label__2	Visiting from SF. Arrived just before 9 and the staff was less than excited for patrons to come in. They were cleaning up to go home even though they close at 10. Took all the condiments while a full bar of people were eating. Dishwasher running. They forget the reason they have a job is because of customers. Food was good but I've had better.
__label__5	Love this place. Webster was in need of a good restaurant and the owners know how to deliver. Delicious food, great beer selection and hand made cocktails. You won't be disappointed.
__label__4	My first trip to Philly and was told by a friend that Philly is a great food town. Three people recommended Buddakan and it did not disappoint. The food was very good although the service a bit of a weak spot. Enjoyed my meal here and would recommend it.
__label__5	We had some issues with the heater, there was no heat upstairs. We called the AAA brothers last Thursday, Alex came in the next day. It took him very short time to diagnose and install the new taco valve at really reasonable price.
__label__4	I love the tamarind soup here.  And the tofu & avocado salad is really light and different.  No liquor license but you can get something from the Shell next door if you're in need.
__label__3	"I think I need to try this place again before I judge it. I think I was coming down with a cold when I went so to be fair I wasn't bringing my A game. 

None of the food ""blew"" my mind but perhaps the cold and my expectations were built up a bit?    The veggie app plate was tasty but kind of greasy.

I will go back again to give it another try...."
__label__4	Probably one of the better places to eat around here. it isn't perfect by any means, but I was really impressed with how fresh and delicious mist of the food was. There were a few items that seemed saturated in grease, or just poorly cooked, but that's a staple of all Golden Corrals. No GC is perfect, but this one is definitely better than most!
__label__3	Everything was overpriced, no value with the food we ordered (short rib nachos and truffle fries).  There was so little short rib in our nachos that we asked for another side of meat and were charged an additional $8, smh.  If you claim to be good you have to over deliver.
__label__3	"Food was well prepared and tasted pretty good. Our table had pho, summer rolls, rice platter, and a noodle bowl. The noodle bowl came with an egg role which was by far the best thing ordered.

Although the food was decent, it was very evident that they were a new restaurant. The service was slow and not demonstrate the best customer service. 

Clean place. Definitely one of the better pho places in Boise."
__label__1	Been on the phone 15 minutes waiting for someone to come back to the phone in the Doors Dept. #Under staffed. Heading to Lowes!!
__label__5	This is only for the roast pork sandwich with the spinach and provolone. It is the perfect marriage of savory, sharp, and tangy. The line was out the door in the middle of January and that should be a pretty good indication of how good these sandwiches are. The Philly Cheese, which won best of Philly 2008, was okay. But the roast pork sandwich stole the show. Can't wait to go to Reading Terminal and try the roast pork with broccoli rabe.
__label__5	Our favorite breakfast place right now. Their corned beef hash is amazing. The waitresses always remember my little details in the order, my coffee and water are always topped off. Great prices too. This is a wonderful treasure of Tucson.
__label__5	Incredible people! Every bite is a new level of deliciousness! Addicted to this beautiful bakery shop...
__label__3	Burgers were simple but order still messed up. The burgers were small & im sure the fries would have been delicious if they were hot. I was told order would take an hour but when i went early to get it they had obviously been sitting out a while because all the food was lukewarm. We'll try another time but 1st impression was so so.
__label__4	"We ate here twice...the pizza is excellent, as are the calzones.  The ""small"" Greek salad is enough for two to share."
__label__4	"Definitely one of the best Thai spots in New Orleans! The food tastes super authentic. 

All the dishes I got were super flavorful. My only complaint is that I ordered everything Thai spicy - which is their hottest - and it def wasn't. I asked for extra bird eye chili on the side and I found that their chilis were not spicy. It was probably just a bad batch of chilis, which isn't their fault."
__label__3	Rustic hotsprings and massage.  Both private and public soaking tubs with natural spring water.  The private baths are tiled, deep and long and the window is colored with different colored glasses.  About 11 miles outside of Reno.  An hour massage is $60 plus a soak in the hot mineral water for $12.
__label__2	"Order placed was not correct and I got the wrong food for take out. They also served me half cooked cherry turnovers which were so gross.  I could not cook them more because they had put icing on them.  

This is the first time I have had this happen but they are sure going to hear about it.  The manager was the one that provided me with my messed up order."
__label__4	pplace is small but the service makes up for it in a big way!! and they have sapporro
__label__4	Great food, large portions, super fast friendly service. They were so busy for lunch when we went but service was great! My soup came out cold but they fixed it immediately. I will definitely return!!
__label__4	Excellent service to get rid of all the stuff you have cluttering your house. All the recycling is free and disposal comes with a reasonable fee. This location can be particularly busy. I recommend using the ambleside Eco Station as it is usually significantly less busy.
__label__5	Best authentic Mexican food in Tampa  Been looking for a spot like this for a while !
__label__4	I was driving by and decided to stop in for a cheesesteak. Don't let the looks of the building fool you. The sandwich was delicious. I am definitely going back.
__label__5	I stopped in for a late lunch after wandering around Society Hill.  I ordered the Cobb salad and a chipotle chicken wrap to go. Both were excellent. Nice folks, reasonable prices, and tasty food. What more could you ask for!?
__label__4	Place is good great food but they always bring you the chicken like 75 times the meat and the lamb maybe twice
__label__1	Was really wanting to like this place, sadly the food was cold, missing items we ordered, service was incredibly slow. Food would sit at the counter for a long time, if it wasn't the servers food they'd leave it sitting there. You get what you pay for and apparently a $3 burger doesn't cut it. The stars on this place don't lie but it was  late and needed somewhere to eat.
__label__4	the bruschetta is bomb. The pizza obviously takes a while to make as it is deep dish. but its worth it.  Not quite chicago status but good for California.  Service is good.
__label__2	Worst pizza ive ever had. I went in there today got a slice of pepperoni pizza. The pizza was still frozen when I ordered it and watched her put it in the lil oven behind her. It was done in like two seconds. I sat down took a bite and the pizza tasted like nothing but bread. As I ate my pizza I noriced bugs in there (a couple of flys and nats). I was empty in there when I walked in (lunch). I guess people avoid that place for a reason.
__label__5	"This place rules! I can always find amazing handmade gifts here, along with awesome stuff for myself! The owner is a lot of fun and always really helpful! 

Everyone should go here and support local businesses and artists!"
__label__2	"I really like this bar. They have a great beer selection and the service is great but the food is way over rated. I had the burger with the cheese in the middle and it was dry. I have the cheese steak things that are fried and they were super greasy. The other day i had the lamb belly sandwich and the lamb its self was really good but the flavor was lost in the whole sandwich. 

Come here, hang out and get drinks but pass if your looking for really good food."
__label__5	Open beautiful space with good food! Feels safe with the outside seating. Highly recommended!
__label__3	"I am giving Grocery an extra star because when i stopped by today I was pleasantly surprised to discover that they have a ""little lolita"" hot bar!

So, instead of the boring couscous salad I was prepared to purchase, I loaded up on rice and beans with smoked chicken and tomatillo sauce.  Yum!

Nice 3/4lb lunch for $5.51 -- not bad.  And the staff today was much friendlier today."
__label__5	I've been here with my book club, and for a girls night out. But just swinging in by myself for a quick sip between shopping or after work on Friday is just as welcoming. The owners are friendly and accommodating. You can order UBER Eats, but I just get the cheese plate then walk down to BadFin for lobster rolls and appetizers later.
__label__5	I've called in looking for odd hardware and they have gotten me what I needed very promptly, and they have given great quotes on lumber over the years.
__label__1	Beautiful facilities but, they will bump you or conveniently loose your reservation if they can fill your room for a dollar more.  Standing in line to check in, which took 20 minutes, i overheard three people  go through this situation.  Then they did to me.  I stay an average  of 50 nights per year at Marriott hotels, and I will avoid staying here if at all possible in the future.  This same situation happened to several people in our group the last time I stayed here as well.
__label__5	Beautiful place! Service was fast and friendly. Food above espectacular ! Tasty vegetarian options and beautifully served.
__label__4	"Flight of 4 -5 oz beers
Cherry cider
Chocolate cherry stout
Proper snakebite(stout + cherry cider)
No name stout

Loaded fries
Chicken gyro w/sweet potato fries
Margarita salad. 

Solid food behind excellent beers. 

$57.75"
__label__4	"Maybe I caught the staff on a bad day (Sunday at noon) but they weren't very friendly, and I waited for more than 30 minutes to get 2 sandwiches ordered at the counter. There weren't many orders in front of us - no acknowledgement from the guys behind the counter on the wait. 

Royal PoBoy was awesome. All that Jazz PoBoy was even better. Worth the wait? Yes. Opportunity for them to improve service? Yes. But I'd go back."
__label__2	"Nothing bad, just nothing to make them stand out. And in Reno with an all you can eat sushi bar on almost every corner you really need something to make you stand out.
We had a coupon which is why we tried them. I would have been disappointed if we hadn't had a coupon and had to pay full price.
The sushi chefs were quick, but the waiter was slow. We were always out of water and soda."
__label__5	Always a great experience when I stop by Maccabee Arms. They are extremely knowledgeable and can answer any questions that you have. I originally bought my firearm from them and then had to go back this past week to purchase night sights for my gun and they were able to install them for me almost immediately. It's always a pleasurable experience. Great service! Definitely recommend stopping by for all your firearm needs.
__label__4	"The key is to stay in the bar area to eat. It's cozy and convivial. Food is excellent, but beware that most glasses of wine 
The dining rooms are a bit too roomy, so you might be alone in the dining room if you don't go at a peak hour. That would be good for a group business dinner, though. Food is excellent; watch out for the wine, though--$12 a glass!"
__label__1	Employees very rude will not be visiting this location anymore a lot better ice cream places to visit
__label__4	"I just had to say it again:

""Hoooooooooooooooooooo!""

I need to send DJ deejay my unique cut of ""The Way You Make Me Feel.""

MMP may be a regular thing for me every month now."
__label__1	If i could leave 0 stars I would. We had way too many issues with them and when they finally delivered our washer and dryer they don't even work. Had to wait on the phone over an hour to at least talk to someone. and when the guy delivered them practically destroyed every doorway and wall we had bringing our stuff in and said all of 2 words to me and my husband. Save your money.
__label__4	Food was great! Brussels sprouts, white arugula pizza, pimento cheese, spinach dip, eggplant shells, and curry cauliflower were some of the best among our table! Atmosphere was nice and place was clean. Service was great as well!
__label__4	Excellent if you are going to eat at the restaurant, it won't keep as well if you are doing takeout. Highly recommend if you are eating there.
__label__4	"Very fun lively winery. I had a good time playing games and tasting wine. 

The inside and outside areas are pretty big, lot of seating. The bar itself is big also.

Only issue was that there was only 2 people pouring wine and the whole place was packed. You had to fight to get your next pour.

Tasting - $12, 6 wines"
__label__5	I came here for a friends birthday brunch and OMG! The food was amazing! The pork belly Benedict was fire! I will definitely be bring all my friends! The staff was great and let's not forget the $11 mimosa with $1 refills! Yassss!
__label__3	I was pretty excited to try this place, as it looks pretty fancy and the pizza always looks good. I'm sad to say I was a bit disappointed. I thought the pizza was just okay, and the pricing was a little high for pizza & a drink. Cute atmosphere, but I don't think I'll be rushing back anytime soon.
__label__5	Service was fast and friendly. Food was hot and tasted great. I like their rice bowls with chicken. My husband gets their chicken tacos and my daughters gets the chicken nachos. Their chips and salsa go great with the food. Place was clean.
__label__2	"I stopped going here. At one time I went all the time, then I noticed on more than two occasions I came in before they closed (over 3 hrs before close) and they said ""we are closed, closed early"".   At that point I was frustrated stopped going.   I had an appointment and no one called to tell me they decided not to be open and it was on a weekend ."
__label__4	Went there with three friends on a recent Wednesday, and we were able to be seated right away. I liked the courtyard layout, although it was a little small. We all enjoyed our entrees (I had the sausage gumbo), and our waiter was pretty cool. :)
__label__5	Took my mom here for a dental appointment and the staff and dentist were amazing! The place was very clean, the staff answered all of my questions and most importantly, they cared. I will be scheduling the rest of my family here for any dental needs.
__label__3	Came here twice. Small section with a handful of stores only. Good deals though. We came back with some dress shirt and running shoes. We came here BC we wanted to stay dry from the rain!
__label__5	I have been using them for years. They do a great job on my dogs. The dogs aren't caged, they are in a pen by the groomers during the waiting times. They listen to my requests. I recommend them to anyone looking for a groomer.
__label__5	"Had a great stay here last weekend. I did not believe the ""Frank"" hype before I got there, but man, that guy is nice. Great location only a block away from the beach. Frank even offered us beach towels and a barrel full of sand toys to take with us."
__label__5	Went to St Elmos with a group of 5 for Devour Downtown.  We were seated right away with water and bread waiting on us.  Service was amazing, the shrimp cocktail was out of this world (as always), the filet could be cut with a fork, I would eat the mashed potatoes everyday and the creme brulee finished it off perfectly.  The only thing I was not impressed with was the salad.  However everything else more than made up for it.  Great place to go anytime.
__label__2	I just moved back to Indy after two agonizing years in Carmel. This is a gorgeous library with a very limited (in comparison to the Indy central lib) selection of books. I might not be so harsh but for a community with such wealth and a large territory to cover, it's discouraging to see only one branch, only two places to return books (sometimes out of order/overflowing), and a more limited selection than I expected.
__label__5	"For me Pizza wise - Woohoo! 

Just knowing it is a Provel- Free-Zone is worth the trip alone. But one can not judge pizza alone by it's cheese. The crust, sauce, and toppings are all Woohoo as well. 

If you are short on glassware at home- Dewey's gives you one of their glasses for dining with them on your birthday. Or, you could come to my house and pick up a few.

Long live Dewey's!!"
__label__5	Brittany and Garet are so great at what they do! They've helped my husband and I so much, I wish i could give more stars. Don't go anywhere else, you need the Movement Chiro!
__label__4	I love the happy hour in this place they've got a special from 5 PM until 7 PM 7 days a week with discounted appetizers drinks and wine selections. My favorite is the beef carpaccio. It is tremendous generous portion and for six bucks you really can't beat it
__label__5	Classic Party Rentals is the best rental company in Santa Barbara. Nicole of CPR's is super knowledgeable about everything from inventory to spacial logistics. Nicole knows what it takes to design a great base for weddings and private events and always suggests items that most forget... Nicole and her entire team go above and beyond to make sure your event runs flawlessly with regards to rental items.
__label__1	Not worth the money. My friends and I were shut off for being too loud and by even told. The owner then swore at us and would not explain his decision.
__label__2	"Horrible service. Went at 9:15 pm. Wasn't crowded. Had to go to the bar to get waters for our table. Had to go find and get ketchup off of the shelves by their register. Waitress took like 10-15 min to even come to our table initially. Oh and my drink was messed up and waiting 10-15 minutes for a fixed one then got charged for 2 drinks! 
Manager said they weren't expecting a rush...we could see its wasn't crowded and they had multiple servers..."
__label__1	Driest cheese steak that I've ever eaten. I will never understand the hype.
__label__4	"Happy with the company and the services received.  They've installed a new air conditioner for us as well as replaced two toilets.

One area to that you need to be aware of is their warranty on labor is just one year.  We had our new AC installed in August 2018 and found out in July 2021 we have a freon leak.  We are working with a competitor for the repair and their workmanship is under-warranty for much longer."
__label__4	Ok, not everything is perfect but ALMOST, I had a Chile Relleno and it was beyond perfection, the cheese the salsa OMG so flavorful but my husband ordered a chicken sandwich and it was ok, not to much flavor but still fine, the view it's beautiful so you have to go and get an outside table.. very nice staff..
__label__5	Unique donuts and a fair selection. Wish they had more choices but I think once they sell out, that's it for the day (at least). Also the lattes are superb. Cozy atmosphere as well. Next time, I plan on trying their donuts burger is hot dog!
__label__4	Great food.  The parking situation is awful.  They share valet parking which leads to problems.  The atmosphere is also a little bit off in my opinion.  They have an old timey looking library look on the walls with 1920s style ceiling with crystal chandeliers and then mid century modern seating circa 1960.  Plus I felt like I was right in top of the couple next to us.  A right fit.  It just doesn't blend in my opinion.  Anyway, the steak was great.  Not sure I would go again....  a definite maybe.
__label__2	Generally I enjoy coming to Barnes and Noble... Until it's time for me to use the restroom.  99% of the time it is NASTY. I was finally so fed up with the way it looked I took pictures.  There's in poop on the floor. For the love God, will someone monitor that restroom on Saturday nights?! DISGUSTING! I will be reporting it to corporate as well.  View my pictures, if you have the stomach.
__label__2	The food is bad, but to make up for it they have spotty service. I realize it is airport food and i have yet to find an airport restaurant that really cares and O'Charley's does not break the mold.
__label__5	Frank was super fast at repairing my old computer! Very honest and very reasonably priced. I thought I would need a new computer and was very relieved  when he told me it could be fixed! He even got it fixed 3 days earlier than I expected! Great guy!  My go to store from now on!!
__label__5	"I recently went to Priscilla Delavega in hopes of going blonde and I was not disappointed! She was so professional, upfront and honest about how we could go about lightening my naturally dark hair color. She recommended products that absolutely helped preserve the health of my hair in between sessions (Don't be unrealistic when going blonde, you need patience and good treatments! Multiple sessions is the way to go!) 

Priscilla has the sweetest personality and helped my dreams of becoming blonde come true! I highly recommend her services! She's awesome!!"
__label__5	They got me in on short notice for an oil change and tire rotation and completed the service on my vehicle quickly. Weber is always great to work with for sales and service. Definitely recommend them.
__label__4	Good food for decent price. Has a nice little patio and even a small dining room. The girl who takes orders at night doesn't seem to be very talkative lol overall pretty chill. Great place to eat when you're drunk!
__label__5	"Whether you want a sandwich,  salad or soup..you will find all that and more here. 
All prepared fresh and fast! 
The jalapeno Turkey crunch sandwich is my favorite sandwich with a large strawberry lemonade! Yum!
Thier potatoe salad is really good as well. In all honesty in all the times I've come here I haven't ordered anything I didnt like. 
They just have good food!! 
Service is fast and always friendly."
__label__5	Have I really not reviewed Tom Tap yet? For shame. This is really the best spot for beer in the city. It's inside the amazing city market. You can always find something new from one of the many Indiana breweries on tap. The bartenders are pretty awesome. Can't go wrong.
__label__5	Food is always delicious and fresh, prices are good, and the staff could not be kinder!! We love being their neighbors.
__label__5	We've been in goleta for an extended stay & this is our spot! The people and the pho is amazing. All cooked there , no freezing . The Tia tea is the best I've ever had. We're going to miss this place & night drive down just for it too
__label__4	Great Authentic Mexican at a reasonable price. The proprietor, Pancho, made great suggestions. The shrimp tostada was awesome as well as the fresh made Guac & salsa's - a gem
__label__2	I  stopped in to get a  Bouquet  of flowers for my daughters performance for $20. Left there and went to Home Depot and saw a dozen roses for $9.99. What a disappointment!!!!
__label__5	I was happy with the food. We had Lamb Korma and Chicken Tikka Masala. We enjoyed both. The Cheese Kulcha with the four dips was also great.
__label__5	I've tried so much of the menu that I'm unsure which to review on, but everything that I have had has been extremely good. I have always had friendly service despite it being so busy at times. The food will be pricier than other spots here but I think that it is justified based on the quality. I do however recommend carrying cash because there's a 30 cent up charge for using card!
__label__4	I've never had a problem when I come to this location. The wings are always good. I recently went back a few days ago after about 2 years of going to another location and everything was correct and freshly made. I just wish the wings would've been fried harder, but that's my fault for not specifying. All in all, good store and I will return if I ever want Wingstop on this side of town.
__label__3	Landmark is the perfect college town bar/restaurant. It's pretty much on the Rowan University campus but does have a wide range of people come in. It was pretty crowded when we go there and parking isn't the best. I drove around for about 10 minutes before someone was coming out of a spot. The food is ok and it was pretty loud on Saturday night being that it's on a college campus. They do have drink specials which was nice. Even though it was really busy our drinks and food came out pretty fast so you can tell they are use to bring packed.
__label__5	The Southbound Group was a joy to work with! Everyone I encountered was professional, organized, and very responsive. This was my first home solo home purchase and the Southbound Group made it easy and stress-free. I have high standards when it comes to customer service and the ladies at the Southbound Group met those standards with ease. Thank you for helping me find my perfect home!
__label__5	"Been awhile, but it felt like a fried chicken kind of night. OK, the real reason is that I had a coupon. But, it still is the best fried chicken in taste and crunch. Biscuits and red beans and rice make a great accompaniments. 

The service is quick and cordial. What amazes me is that there is only one store in the entire area. 

So until they get a Bojangles here. Popeyes sets the high bar for fried chicken in the Boise area."
__label__5	Wanted to say thank you to Janet for helping us pick out tile and granite for our bathroom remodel.  The tile arrived on time and intact and turned out great.  It was a pleasure doing business with Earth Stone Gallery.  Would definitely recommend this company.
__label__5	Unassuming from the outside, the food is the best I've had in a very long time.  Fresh quality ingredients and made from scratch.  Friendly owners, that will provide mouth watering details about how the food was prepared.   The Mac and Cheese is the best! Oh, and the smoked pulled pork and pulled Chicken is excellent.
__label__3	I frequent this Starbucks for business and, out of the 3 in Doylestown, this one is the most 'work-friendly.' It's not too crowded and there's plenty of seats and outlets. Word of advise though: avoid like the plague on weekend nights due to teenie boppers getting dropped off for movie night.
__label__3	What I like most about this spot is the different levels and the seating.  After we ate we hung for hours and we were able to watch football relax and drink our cocktails. They do play live music down stairs however, I never been much for bluegrass. Food was pretty good and the service was excellent.
__label__5	What a cute little restaurant! I love the atmosphere! It's like you're sitting in someone's kitchen. The place is filled with cookbooks, art, and canned goods, to give the feeling of a kitchen. Food was amazing and I appreciated the fact that they let me know what soup was vegetarian and that they specifically didn't contain chicken broth. Plus they make some of their own baked goods, which were the best I've ever had (sorry mom) I'm going to make this a regular place to stop at.
__label__5	"Had to wait a while for our order since there was a party of 20 ahead of us, but the staff was very friendly and told us our food was on the house! It was a cool location, and everyone was very friendly. Avery, our waiter, was only on his second day working there but did a fantastic job!

Food was great, definitely would recommend going here!"
__label__5	"This is an awesome place to stay! It is in a wonderful location...close to the French Market, & a few blocks from Bourbon St. Everything in the French Quarter is walkable from here :-). The people working here are also great! Very helpful! 
We were on a road trip from S. FL to CA, and loved this hotel (& the French Quarter!!) so much that we stopped back here on our way home!!! 
Wonderful place!!"
__label__1	"First time at this theater. Will not return. Yes, it was clean, seats were comfortable, picture was clear, good sound But the Grill part was horrid! Over 50 minutes from the time we placed our order till the meal was delivered. Of course we had to ask two different servers to find our meal. Nothing but excuses. When my pizza arrived it was barely warm and overcooked. Basically they ruined a frozen pizza.
No manager alerted when I expressed my disappointment.
Oh, they comped the sodas, how generous!
Momma Mia!"
__label__1	Dry rice, over cooked eel. Hard, old cucumber.. Save your money and go somewhere else.
__label__5	They always go above and beyond! Love the for and the desserts. Plus they asked if we were celebrating anything, we said we sold our home and this is how the cake showed up!!  it makes my heart  happy to come here every time!!
__label__2	"Very nice people here and good service. 
I've experienced Jacks donuts in the past, but 
Today I didn't enjoy. To be fair, there wasn't a large 
Selection, but the cake donuts weren't like cake donuts;
they were all sugar all the way through.  It was like the 
whole donut was made of icing."
__label__4	"SO...

I was hungry, wanted a drink and wanted to watch my Aggies play.  Had the rest of our large party come join us as the appetizers were amazing!   Later trip, had the burger and just fell in love with this place.  

Great tasting food.  Reasonable prices and outstanding service on more than a few trips there.  

Thus if you are looking for a place to pad the gut before you begin slamming booze, go here!!!"
__label__3	Nice that this place was open late on a Sunday night, but expected, I suppose, since it's in a tourist area. Amazingly busy at that time too. We had the lagniappe basket (fried catfish, oysters, crayfish and shrimp) and red beans and rice. And an Abita. I think the waitress was a bit disappointed that we didn't order more drinks, as it seemed most people in the place were there for drinks. The fried stuff was ok, and I liked the catfish and oysters best. The crayfish and shrimp seemed tough.
__label__1	Honestly wasn't the five stars as it said the only good thing that was good was the honey vanilla ice cream the rainbow one was not good and the banana was Horrible did not like it and the waffle was very salty and hard will not go back again!! I had to force myself to eat it. And got my ice cream wrong after I told the worker what I had wanted.
__label__5	Zia's was recommended to us by another family visiting St. Louis. What a gem. Everything we ordered was delicious. Started with toasted ravioli and fried mozzarella. Had Zia's salad, cannelloni, and chicken parmigiana. Staff was great and very friendly. We ended up purchasing their dipping oil and salad dressing.
__label__5	The receptionist was very nice and got me settled in right away, and all the girls were super professional and informative throughout the whole process. I got the glam dolleye set and it came out super pretty! I would recommend FN Lashes to anyone who's interested in getting lash extensions!
__label__1	"Dear wanna be hipsters who rated this place so highly, this is not a good restaurant. If you like $10 watered down cocktails, stingy over-priced meals, and uninspired menu items than yea this place is awesome. The place was empty on a Thursday night and we waited at least 10 minutes for drinks and another 15 minutes for a cheese plate. $5 for one piece of cheese. 

Please do not waste your time or money on this place. I lost $25 on 2 drinks and a cheese plate but more importantly I wasted one hour of my life I will never regain."
__label__5	Absolutely delicious. Tried multiple items. Enjoyed all of them. Hot sauce is hot. Hotter sauce is even hotter. The hottest sauce is liquid magma. Flavor is spectacular but difficult to handle! I will eat here again!
__label__5	Wonderful everything.  Love the lunch buffet.  Fantastic butter chicken and chicken tikka masala.  Also love the palak paneer.  Naan is a little dry, but probably just from sitting on the buffet.  Dinner is fantastic here as well.
__label__5	Awesome place food from all over and not from a can... mostly Italians and middle eastern great place to find gourmet items not to be missed while in philly
__label__5	This is probably the best breakfast place I have ever eaten...amazing place...im a health enthusiast and this place is all about healthy choices...it is farm fresh to the table food...amazing...i love it...bit expensive...
__label__3	The food was okay we got the curry and the oxtail. I was a bit underwhelmed the food tasted bland like it wasn't well seasoned. I expected a bit more i guess. Might give them another try maybe it was just a bad day.
__label__3	I came here one afternoon to try the lunch buffet. Although the service was good and the dining area had a lot of Old Pueblo charm, I was not overly impressed by the food. Everything on the buffet except for the albondigas was either wrapped in a flour tortilla and deep-fried or covered in cheese;  there was not a single vegetable dish. The food was okay, but I certainly didn't get a balanced meal. I left feeling more tired than I did before my meal.
__label__5	I have been going here for months and I absolutely love it. I usually get a dip manicure and a regular pedi and it comes out flawless every single time. They stay pretty busy though, so it's best to make an appointment at least a day before. Even without the appointment though they always try to squeeze me in! The staff is super friendly towards guests and each other which is especially pleasant to be around. There is also a very clean and relaxing atmosphere. Price points are very fair and you pay for a better quality mani/pedi. I will always recommend this place to friends and family.
__label__4	"Great brunch, had the salmon fume a cheval and shared the berrylicious pain perdu; both were delicious!! Ingredients are so fresh, portion size was just right and the service was very good!

The place is rather small, so there was a long wait (Sunday morning) and the tables are tiny/close together.
If you can deal with that, this is a great brunch spot."
__label__2	This is not a great burger. We all ordered medium rare and got black. So far over cooked it was difficult to enjoy. It was crunchy with no sign of juice or moisture. Pleasant service did not make up for food quality. You'd be better off at Chilis.
__label__2	They are a pain to deal with when it comes to insurance. Stay far away from this place, Philly has many other dentists around you can choose from.
__label__5	Harris Paving was working next door and we asked if they might be able to repave our very long and very cracked driveway at the same time.  They did a great job and were very courteous and fast! A positive experience all around.
__label__5	Food was excellent and fresh. We had the fried oysters and the crab and sausage hand made noodles. The flavors were exciting, exotic and fresh. Definitely would go there again!
__label__1	Wouldn't waste my time with this company or diet. Yes I lost a few pounds. After your 1st order you have to order at least $150 more if you want to cancel membership. They send you reviews to rate foods but would probably take you at least 30 minutes to do so. It's stupid. I would give the food 2-3 stars because the stuffed chicken And some of the breakfast bars were ok. Very unhappy!!!
__label__1	Took my teenage daughter here, on a Sunday. The ladies, behind the desk, were wonderful. Dr. Abraham, needs to work on his bedside manner. He was horrible! I agree, with the other person, who commented about him.  My daughter, has been a patient of the Temple Health System, since birth. Never going here again! Treated us like we were a nuisance.
__label__5	Travelled to New Orleans a few years ago and this was probably my favorite food experience there (and there really is a ton to choose from!). The ambiance is great, the food even better, and the wait staff knew what allergens were in each menu item. We got some raw fish and then a whole fish. I recommend the whole fish because it was so delicious and very unique!
__label__4	We were here for Devour. Had the steak medallion trio and a glass of Shiraz. The steak was cooked to medium which was correct, but the outside temperature was quite cool like it had been sitting for a while before being served. I know it was Devour, but the meal was still quite pricey so my expectations were high.  The server was very friendly and food was served promptly.
__label__5	"this place is handsdown awesome.

clandestine spot for intimate drinks.  the place is hidden and the doorman is somehow really intimidating and protective and accommodating and polite at the same time.  drinks were delicious and extremely smooth.  yes, they are pricey, but i believe this is a place where you get what you pay for.

the staff were also excellent and the atmosphere was alluring.  i'd definitely go back again and again."
__label__5	Everything in this shop is incredible right down to their tasty chai teas and coffees. Their king cakes are moist and decadent. This was a great place to stumble upon unexpectedly while walking to lunch.
__label__4	"Still waiting for price drop from Amazon purchase with ideal for bringing prices down 
Love the hot food bar. I  can buy small spoonfuls of many items and stay under 10 $ range for breakfast and lunch... Yet I've got several items w veg choices a many. Lots of soups..delicious..  And easy to go for tight scheduled day"
__label__4	The food was great for the most part. The service was perfect! My lamb was tough but my sever was quick to bring me a crab cake as my second choice! The piano made the atmosphere perfect! Mussels Outstanding! Chilean Seabass Outstanding!
__label__1	SELLER BEWARE!  I have never taken clothes in for consignment and after this horrible experience I will never do it again.  I am assuming this business is a sham as I have been trying for months to reach them and either they don't return my messages or I can't get through.  They consigned 17 pieces of nice clothing early this Spring and I have not heard a peep...no check, no charity slip, no return responses, nothing.  You should be ashamed of yourselves!  Where is my money?
__label__3	The bacon Mac and cheese was very good and so was the BLT salad.  The chicken lettuce wraps were ok.
__label__5	Favorite place for ice cream in the city! So many dairy free and vegan options, and the best part is they actually taste like real ice cream. Plus they have the most creative flavors you won't ever find anywhere else like Earl Grey Sriracha and Ranch. My personal favorites are the coconut lime which is dairy free, and the vanilla cardamom - which is not dairy free, but it is worth it for this deliciousness ;)
__label__3	"Walking in the restaurant and saw no Asians, my gut tells me that the food is not gonna taste good. My instinct was right. Not only the shumai's taste wasn't that great, but also the presentation did not live up to dim sum standard 
The bathroom kinda dingy, toilet is clogged"
__label__5	So cute! A must stop on your Nashville adventure!!! Cutest drinks and brunch spot. I got the red sangria and an egg white and fruit brunch. My friends for mimosas. We are all so happy!
__label__5	If I get fried chicken, this is where I go.  I get medium and it makes me sweat but not hurt.  Sometimes I get the tenders but usually a plate.  It's just good!!
__label__5	Awesome spot! Order early in the week when they open up Wednesday and you might be able to snag some limited goodies. We ordered a couple McLovin sandwiches that we couldn't stop lovin. Also got the BBQ half chicken which was super limited but oh so delicious with that crispy BBQ skin. Don't sleep on the tots and cornbread either because they are bomb. Lastly the fried chicken wings and butterscotch pudding were also very legit. Really liked this spot and would easily come back again and again.
__label__3	This location is definitely one full of local neighborhood customers! The service is quick but not pushy. My orders are always consistent. Sometimes the food and pastries don't look fresh but I have seen them rotate/discard items at the end of the night so it should taste fresh. They have bar style seating and plenty of different sized tables, including outside, to accommodate study groups, business meetings and just hanging out. Free wifi connection is always strong on my ipad.
__label__5	"Excellent service and prompt response.  I needed to re-hang an exterior door that had been badly damaged and could not close.   Phil recognized the significance of my situation and adjusted his schedule to attend to my issue, within 20 minutes of my request for services.  He gave a very fair rate, especially for a holiday and an ""emergency"" situation.   His technical skill and knowledge were exceptional and his rates very reasonable. I highly recommend his services and will definitely use his handyman and repair services again. BNewbill"
__label__5	Wonderful dinner! Food and service were as lovely as always. The team did a wonderful job with safety and cleaning protocols. Everyone was in masks. Thank you for an awesome, safe experience!
__label__2	What a disappointment. Apparently the place has changed hands since we were here last. The oyster stew had potatoes that weren't fully cooked (it used to be to-die-for). Seascape platter had shrimp and scallops that were both overlooked. Drinks were well made except they didn't have martini glasses for our martinis. The best part was the oysters,  Go for a dozen and then go elsewhere for dinner.
__label__3	"Great little Mexican place with an attractive lunch buffet and very friendly, welcoming staff.  The guacamole and pico de gallo  on the buffet were awesome!  Much of the rest was somewhat uninspired -- iceberg lettuce resting in water, decent enchiladas that looked like something your mom might make from ""Taste of Home"" -- but the selection is ample and attractive.  I definitely plan to go back for dinner to try the seafood."
__label__5	The meal was amazing and the service was even better my family and I will attend often!
__label__5	I can not thank Jill enough! Not only were my flowers beautiful and exactly what I wanted, but she helped to make the day run so smoothly. After delivering my flowers she drove over to the church and helped to guard the door so people would not see me before walking down the aisle, and she stayed to see me down the aisle. When I got to the reception she was already there too, getting things together and making sure it was absolutely perfect. I could not imagine a better experience with a florist and I highly recommend her to any future bride!
__label__5	So, so, soooo good! Probably one of my favorite restaurants in the city. I love tofu and really enjoy theirs. They make great spring rolls and bun. They also make this delicious dish with pan fried noodles, tofu, tomatoes, and this delicious sauce. It is one of the best things i've ever ate. Can't go wrong here!
__label__4	Went for the first time today. Liked the atmosphere, very beach. Good food, great service, reasonably priced. We'll be back!!
__label__5	Love me some chipotle! Had the usual quesarito. Take a while to make but worth the wait.
__label__5	The food preparation offered a fresh alternative. I liked the complimentary dessert (with chocolate chips). The pizza was muy bueno!!
__label__5	Robie was the best! Great friendly service and the best burger I have ever eaten. Everything was delicious. Could not have been more satisfied. Beautiful restaurant!
__label__5	Wow... amazing breakfast. Be prepared for lots of food! It was a Saturday morning, during peaks hours and we were in and out quickly. The menu has something for everyone. Don't pass this place up!!
__label__5	I recently had my hair cut and colored here and they did an amazing job. They also took precautions to limit my interactions with other guests and had a limited capacity so I didn't feel weird getting my hair done during COVID. I will definitely be returning to this salon.
__label__4	this place has good food, and an excellent bartender named Matt who is tall. only down side is that the place is COLD not only in the winter time if you are sitting close to the door but also in the summer i have to wear a jacket inside!
__label__4	Always great food. Great toast, just don't like the yelling from the hostess for the waiting list. other than that. yummy!
__label__2	I ordered the Mega Pork ramen with a side of gyoza. First off, the gyoza was very tasty. The ramen broth was nice and rich and the noodles cooked perfectly. I added some chili oil to give it a little heat. Personally I was not a fan of the flavor profile of the pork. It tasted as if it were marinated or cured in a brine that competed with the flavor of the broth, making it unpleasant. I would order something different if I dined here again.
__label__4	A very nice restaurant, some of the dishes were boujee, if you're into that, but the calamari was good. They had a nice live singer and the setting and mood was peaceful. They have a full bar. Try the truffle mayo.
__label__4	"Just a tiny place with a couple of tables. They have maybe 8 types of cupcakes. I had the salted caramel one which is soft chocolate cake with thick chocolate icing and a little caramel on top.
Very yummy."
__label__5	My sister and I loved our visit to Royal House on Monday afternoon. We sat at the bar and had the chargrilled oysters.  The were delicious!  I thought the atmosphere and service were great
__label__5	Are you kidding me or joking me?  This is by far the best place to get your plumbing and electrical supplies in the free world. You will find their prices competitive with the big boxes. The staff is amazing. You will go home with what you need saving you many return trips. Best of the best.
__label__5	Responded quickly, kept me well informed throughout the process, completed the job quickly and got me up and running as promised.  Also, they were professional and friendly.  Will use them again and can highly recommend them.
__label__3	"This is my second visit to Saffron. The food got better this time. I think they needed time to kind of settle down in the new location with new Chef's. But lack of variety in menu is definitely a drawback.

Finally, this again is not an authentic Indian restaurant but is more like Americanized. Maybe that is the reason they have only standard or well know dishes and limited variety on the menu.

Team, look forward for a variety in menu."
__label__5	I attended an event at The Club and the staff was super friendly, the venue clean and pretty and we had a great time. The Club is very family oriented and offers events each month for people of all ages. Most events are open to members and their friends. Really enjoyed myself.
__label__1	Check out the age policy before going. Cinemark will be getting a lot more of our business from now on. Anyone under 18. must have an adult over 21 with them , so two 16 year olds can't just go to a movie, they have to bring a 21 year old, who can in turn buy the liquor. Silly, parents should be able to drop their teen kids off to see a movie and then pick them up. Or they just go themselves, imagine that
__label__1	I got food poisoning, their spicy tuna roll is out of a bag, made ??? Who knows where, they have a sushi bar why can't they make it there!!!!
__label__4	"Please keep the Power Blend Salad on the menu. Grilled chicken, mixed greens, red and yellow peppers, Marcona almonds with a light Miso Soy Vinaigrette.

My husband and I have always enjoyed Pane Rustica's grilled chicken salads (chopped not so much) but we especially like the combination of ingredients in the Power Blend Salad."
__label__5	"I love this place.  I wish we had them in California!  The service was great, the food perfectly cooked.  I had breakfast for lunch- and loved the grits, and loved the Spiced Apple Butter.  I also tried my dad's pancakes that were so delicious with the Marion Berry Topping.

Will always stop whenever there's one close by!"
__label__2	I really wanted to like this place.  The owner is a very nice guy and recommended  the special which was fish that was filet at your table.  I thought the fish was dry (really dry) and over priced.  The polenta that we had as an appetizer was very good but not much and again over priced.  My granddaughter had chicken fingers which she did not eat I tried one and honestly chick fil-a has better fingers. We then ordered desert  which came out half frozen.  Sorry just not a good experience. .
__label__1	Absolutely awful and over price food. Don't care service attitude. Need to keep asking for water refill. The only time we see our server was when he drop off the food or fill our water (after multiple times of asking). I've eaten lots of Korean restaurants in town and out of town. Tofu house is the worst.  Stay away folks, you will be very disappointed.
__label__5	Great boba tea selection! The flavors are not too sweet and you can taste the flavors of the actual tea. They also serve coffee and it's pretty good as well. They have a great patio that's perfect for afternoon tea hangouts.
__label__5	Had a lunch meeting in the City. One of the best Steaks ever. Decor very nice. Service excellent. Highly recommend.  Cannot wait to go back.
__label__5	I'm always blown away by proper bagel. Hands down favorite quick breakfast to bring to friends or eat myself! East take out or eat at their picnic tables. Get the sweet potato smash!! The creama coffee is so good too!
__label__5	Tony was the sweetest, warmest host. My blueberry bagel was delicious with strawberry schemer. My friend got a sandwich with some of the best pastrami we've both ever had! Great service! Ate too fast for pics
__label__1	"Gracious! It's really not that hard folks. The genuine ""I don't care if you're here or not"" vibe is out there. It's pretty obvious they don't mind if you don't come back. 

It's consistently average on all fronts. But the service is the biggest reason for the score. 

The last time our group of six dropped came with a 30 minute waiting game until our server came and acknowledged us. She was really nice, but it seems like maybe they need more staff or better management/leadership."
__label__2	Having lived in LA, I have tested many versions of Mexican food.El Vez is NOT a place to get your mexican fix not even for Guacamole. It is a place to hang out with friends and Margaritas. This place is not about food. Service is good. My husband I stopped here for dinner since it started raining and did not walk another couple of blocks to our favorite place. It was a mistake. Nothing about the food was memorable.
__label__1	Needs updating and a good CLEANING!!!! The hotel furniture, carpet and building is in a need for an update. The sheets needs to be replaced, as the sheets on my bad had stains on them. There was not enough staff present for the week I checked in(12/24-12/27) but the staff that was there was friendly. I will not stay here again.
__label__1	"Pretty sure they stole my cell phone. 

I left it on there table, they called to say they found it but hung up on my mom. The manager kept it for me out back next to the dumpster, someone tried to use my iPay an hour after I left it there. Why put someone's cell phone out back by a dumpster?"
__label__5	I have used Boise City Taxi many times for business related travel and they are always ontime, reasonable costs and friendly. Recently we went on a family vacation and they sent a van for a $5 up charge to hold our 4 pax/6 bags.  It was awesome and well worth the extra $5 to not have to drive to airport or take 2 cabs.  I have never had an issue with them and very reliable.
__label__5	I have been coming to the original Galatoire's for years but this was my first time to the other side. As the bar opens before the original dining room for lunch, we grabbed a mimosa before our reservation. As I expected from such an establishment, the service was friendly and attentive and our mimosas were delicious. I am looking forward to trying the steak at this side the next time I'm in town.
__label__5	Los tacos de pollo y carnitas son riquísimo. Puro sabor mexicano ingredientes frescos y con una rica textura. Love it®
__label__4	Nice surprise for lunch today. Jerk mahi mahi was fresh, if a little light on the Jerk seasoning. Shrimp with Pasta was a better choice. Drinks big and affordable. Ashley was a great waitress and treated us well. Hope to be back for the luau in March!
__label__3	Don't you just love eating late? The food is ok, but the best thing about this place is the atmosphere, and the fact that it is open--always. Do not expect service to be fast, but do expect it to be sassy, and would you have it any other way?
__label__3	Friendly service on the phone. Nice delivery driver that did not take forever. Will order again. Feta sticks were a welcome change from the usual mozzarella sticks but don't travel well. I'm sure they are awesome fresh out of the oven, but were just okay delivered.
__label__4	"We stoped here in our way to Paso Robles from Santa Bárbara 
Their danish pancakes were delicious overall a good little mom & pop breakfast place. I would definitely eat here again"
__label__4	The people here are very nice.  The atmosphere is classy and usually quiet.  The food is delicious, and the price is fair.  Can't complain!
__label__4	I ordered through DoorDash and the delivery was quick but the order was all wrong. I called IHOP right away and Denise remade the order brought it to us personally and refused a tip. We had a great omelette, great blueberry pancakes and good burger. I appreciate her attempt to make it right. It says a lot for IHOP.
__label__5	Love DHY! The instructors are awesome and I love the variety of the classes based on who is teaching. I always feel welcomed and I leave drenched in sweat with a clearer mind from a great practice.
__label__5	This place is awesome. Great ice cream and shake options. I'm here too often and plan to keep returning.
__label__4	Great service and atmosphere. Sauces are amazing. However I always find myself disappointed in the tenders and fries. Apple dippers are excellent tho.
__label__5	Slinger anyone? Perfect meal anytime of day. I got a slinger with an added tamale: perfection! Pancakes are always a bit crispy on the edges and taste soooo good! My hamburger was delicious with a grilled bun. This place is always clean, well staffed and very attentive to customers.
__label__5	Always great service and great food! Breakfast is great at Rosie's! Out of town guests always love it too.
__label__3	Meh. Not great. The Kimchi Pork Belly bowl was pretty dry. Just rice and pork belly with a side of kimchi and some white crap - whatever that was, was a good add to the bowl. I'd go back for tacos but the bowls were dry and the burrito looked the same.
__label__5	Found a good house cleaner who a.) is taking new clients, b.) does a good job, c.) handles West/SW Philly, and is d.) affordable! Joanna just left my house after a post-construction cleanup, and it looks great - she brings her own supplies, is very prompt, and very responsive! Super pleased!
__label__2	Subpar for a CFA. Food tasted off. Shorted me on my nuggets. Fries were really bland, no flavor. Worst redesign ever! Feels like I'm in a McDonald's. Screaming kids EVERYWHERE! How does it stay so packed...?
__label__4	"Phone staff was friendly, responsive and helpful.

Portion (of the family dinner) was enormous!  Plenty left over for next day.

We enjoyed everything about it.  Glad to see the menu growing with variety.  We're instant fans and will be trying again very soon."
__label__3	We have enjoyed hanging out in the bar here and listening to the music - always a good time.  So we tried it for lunch one beautiful day, when they sat us out in their lovely courtyard.  Very pleasant space!  The bad news is that it took us nearly an hour to get our food, and the place wasn't very crowded, so what happened?  The waitress was not helpful or very good at all.  The food was fine.  We'll definitely be back for drinks, but we won't be back for lunch unless we have lots of time to kill.
__label__5	We went in on a rainy day and they very nicely served us, the menu here is very limited but this place is still very good, would recommend.
__label__5	Went there many times with friends. It's a great place and food. My favorites are goat Curry with  pilau rice and the groundnut banana with the fish sauce. The ground banana is  delicious it tastes like smashed potatoes.  Plus, they have a buffet between 11-3pm. I think it's best time come in and try the many choices they have.  In addition, the sambusa and the chapati bread are great too! Totally coming back again!
__label__1	"The staff of this store rushed me so fast I thought I was a transmission on a assembly line! In addition they have selective customer service because the first thing out of his mouth was ""what kind of bread do you want?"" The next guy he says ""yes sir, can I help you?"" Definitely won't be spending my money at this sub factory anymore! The sandwich was fair...."
__label__4	Fabulous food in a truly beautiful setting. Oldest restaurant of its type in Fl. The service was beyond reproach as was the delish food. The appetizers, soups, sides & entrees were so delicious. The deserts were shared as were tasting of several of the plates. Some of my favorites was the 1905 Salad, Roma Vieja, the original Cuban & the White Chocolate Bread Pudding. The original is here in Tampa but there are other locations such as Orlando.
__label__1	"Worst place to bring your loved one!  
My mother was there for two weeks.  It was awful.  Staff for most part are uncaring and incompetent. Our family brought in Clorox wipes just to clean the immediate area my mom was in. I did open a grievance with the Az State licensing to have them investigated."
__label__1	Don't waste your time here. Service is absolutely terrible and I'd avoid this place like the plague.
__label__4	"(3.5) ~ Good overall food & service.  NOTES:  Yes, they take Credit Cards.  This is a Bake-At-Home place and the pizza takes about (10) minutes to cook.  The Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough is located in their freezer section when you walk in;)

OUR MENU:
* Upside Down Pizza = (3.5) good
* Chocolate Chip Cookies = (3.5) good"
__label__4	I came here for takeout during the week. I ordered onion rings and their veggie burger, both were good. I think the onions rings while good are overpriced. I would visit again, next time to try one of their milkshakes.
__label__3	They serve quick mexican food here, good location and it's pretty good food I would compare it to Chipolte. This pl
__label__5	Very good ice cream! It's all made right in the shop. They have tons of ice cream flavor as well as their speciality creations. I had the Cookie Monster: Cookie Monster ice cream, with Oreo and chip ahoy pieces topped with hot fudge. If you have a sweet tooth then this is your kind of place!! On another note, they ONLY TAKE CASH. I will definitely be back!
__label__4	I always come and get food from here.. Good sandwich and good price.. The only thing I would say they need to change is, they need to put more stuff on your sandwich.. They never put enough and charge a lot when you want extra
__label__5	We just moved to Golden Valley from South Reno and loved our old Vet, but needed someone closer. Our pets just needed check ups and shots, but we were impressed with the clinic, receptionist and Vet. Very knowledgeable and super friendly!
__label__4	Good simple food, fast and hot. Has beer and a cool eating challenge, if you can hang. Little pricey.
__label__5	"Always good and consistent. The first one I was ever in was in the Pittsburgh, Denver and now Florida. Our server was Lyssa, just as sweet as can be and attentive. Everyone was hustling and taking immediate care of the patrons. I had the avocado toast  and husband had oatmeal with fresh fruit and a lemon chia muffin.
It was a great atmosphere where they were all team players."
__label__5	This was our first time being at one of Emeril's restaurants and what can I say... wow!! We were fortunate enough to try the 5 course tasting menu and it was unbelievably amazing. There were options in there that I wouldn't particularly order in my own (oysters, skate fish) but it all tasted amazing. The service was also phenomenal. We would love to try one of the other two restaurants of Emeril's when we visit New Orleans next time!
__label__4	l  ordered 30 wing's They were tuff and over cooked. I'll never order wings from there again .I originally only wanted 24 but they sell only 20,30 or more.Clever marketing but not good for the patron.
__label__5	This place is SO cute and the food is incredible. The chorizo and pollo paella is out of this world! Will be thinking about it until my next trip back to Santa Barbara when I can go again.
__label__1	I'm at the hotel now. Finally got up to my room after they refused to let me check in 20 min early (but I saw them letting others check in). Let's not forget to mention I paid $400+ for one night here. The room is absolutely disgusting. There are stains everywhere. There is a loud ringing noise that I can't figure out what it is or where it's coming from. I'm absolutely disgusting by this place.
__label__5	Without a doubt,  I'll never go anywhere else for my flowers.  Nothing compares to the quality and arrangements.  They don't disappoint ever.
__label__5	I love this place for breakfast!  I am not usually an eggs benedict guy but this place has amazing eggs benedict dishes.  I have loved every dish I have had here.  The staff is friendly and the pricing fair.  See you there this weekend.
__label__5	This place has a great atmosphere.. great salsa and the tacos are amazing. I had the BBQ duck, Carne Assad, and Grilled Portobello tacos. All of them were delicious and I highly recommend.
__label__1	I went in with either a swollen battery or moisture in my trackpad. I knew I needed one of them replaced. I went to the Apple store and didn't feel like waiting around so I popped into Springboard to what I thought would be a quick affordable fix. 5 days and a $174 later my battery is replaced. I should have just went to Apple and waited the hour, it would have costed me about $80. An expensive lesson for sure. Just go to the Apple store and don't get ripped off.
__label__4	"The remodel of this location? Wonderful! Vastly improved booze & deli selection and an emphasis on local/regional companies. 

The meat department could still use some work - though the added butcher case helps a LOT - and a more diligent eye is needed in produce. The department is too much for me to find rotting tomatoes on multiple occasions."
__label__5	"EDIT:RETURN VISIT...
We returned to House Of India tonight to celebrate our Anniversary.
Robert and the staff were very helpful.
We tried some different items and everything was delicious!
We tried the new desserts, also, but we were so stuffed, we enjoyed the sweetes at home. The desserts were also very good!
We will try to return more often to enjoy the delicious food.
Thank you, Robert and House Of India!"
__label__5	I love ordering online and then going to the drive thru. The food is delicious. Has helped keep me healthy and sane during covid-19. I am happily addicted to the basil pesto hummus!
__label__5	The cupcakes are the best! The red velvet one is amazing. They also have a mini collection with different flavors which is a good way to try other flavors. I always go for dessert after Bar taco.
__label__1	Unfortunately we were not able to enjoy this place as we came with our two year old and were turned away.  Regardless of the other positive reviews we will never go to this establishment due to their discrimination against young children.
__label__5	"Service is always great. I haven't gotten a bad massage from anyone here. I wish they had deep tissue massages. The masseuse are so good at what they do. I always feel great after. 

If you come, make an appointment to be sure. They're becoming more and more busy. All my family and mom's friends want to come. 

Thanks for always treating us right!"
__label__5	Me and my partner dined out tonight and the service was impeccable. The food was everything we've heard about. And Adam really made the experience. He was extremely attentive and will request him next time! 10/10!
__label__1	"Definitely just racially profiled at this establishment!

My daughter had an appt here, we were 8 minutes late 
Once they saw the texture of her hair they would not take her, BUT offered to dry shampoo her hair instead. 
Wouldn't this amount of time to dry shampoo and blow it out be the same time? 
Emily the owner was extremely condescending and when my daughter had tears in her eyes begging her to please wash her hair she absolutely did not care. 
I understand that being on time is important but all the ""dry shampoo"" talk took at least 15 minutes
 Do not support this establishment"
__label__1	I've been a customer of this location for close to 13 years. From the time they opened. Today we ordered $60 worth of food through Uber. It was to be delivered less than 5 minutes from the location. It took over an hour. That's not the issue. The food had a nasty smell to it like rotten vegetables. It was inedible. Not going to be back, can't stomach it after the smell of rotten food.
__label__1	Called to get an estimate, and charges $105 minimum and doesn't come out for estimates, wants pictures...when I told him that was a lot to put a latch on a gate, he literally hung up on me.  Wowww...  with that kind of customer service, whew, I dodged a bullet!
__label__5	They have hit the perfect formula, and don't be afraid, because you can get a great hamburger also. Comfortable atmosphere, pretty quick turnaround, all natural, but not in your face
__label__5	"When the food is actually as good as it looks! The house made wine is delicious especially their reds. Highly recommend and their portions are huge as pictured!! 

Very tasty. We had their drunken noodles and pad se ew. The salmon and fried tofu were also a plus!!!"
__label__5	"Having a Deeping nails here with coffin shape 
Just great
Fast service 
Wonderful moment"
__label__5	Cool place. Chicken in front - good portions of ala cart food selections had 1/2 chicken, yellow rice with black beans and plantains. Excellent food at a good price. Back room - past rest rooms is a door into the whiskey bar - choices galore. Great atmosphere. Tables, bar or area to stand and set drinks. Off the beaten path but worth the trip!
__label__4	We had a great time. When we got there and saw the price we almost turned around and went home. Luckily mother in law paid for entrance. It was pretty cool and we had a great time. Our favorite part was the baby goats. So cute. Ended up spending 5ish hours there so we got our $ worth. I am excited to check out the xmas stuff.
__label__4	Good local sandwich shop - glad it's nearby. Slightly too much oil/vinegar on sandwich but overall very good and friendly place.
__label__5	Guinness poured here is the best pour in the city. Local bar lots of law enforcement folk hang here. If you're a tourist and you want to stop by a bar in the French Quarter where people who live in New Orleans choose to go, you should stop in and grab a pint.
__label__3	The ice cream is good, but honestly not worth the price or waiting in a long line. I prefer a good, creamy ice cream from Ben n Jerry's or cold stone, but if you like exotic flavors or are on 12th Ave. jenni's is solid.
__label__4	I don't see what the problem is.... The food was good. The service was great. The atmosphere wasn't too loud. We had a party of 5 and we all agreed that it was worth coming back.
__label__5	Very decent handmade soup dumplings. Not quite Din Tai Fung quality and uniformity, but deliciously imperfect nonetheless.
__label__5	Again not sure what the point is of reviewing airports but I'm bored and doing so anyways. I was very impressed with this airport for a smallish city. Very new and clean and tons of dining and gift options everywhere. The layout made sense and lots of dining inside and outside security. The rental cars were right next door and easy to get out of the airport as well. All you need!
__label__5	Loved this restaurant. Sat right down and had the best fish. Viktoria was the BEST waiter ever! Would definitely recommend this restaurant!
__label__2	"I was here and ordered a couple of gyros (one for me and one for a friend). I was not impressed at all. Mine tasted more like a cheese steak with gyros meat. The ""tzatziki sauce"" was merely melted cheese and the meat was sliced pretty thick. 

On a positive note, the staff was friendly and courteous and the service was prompt-though that may because hardly anyone else was in there. 

Price-wise, the 2 gyros cost just a hair under $20 which, in my opinion, was overpriced considering the quality."
__label__3	This place is a great spot for lunch. Only complaint is that the food takes a really long time to come out.
__label__3	"Room was decent and the main customer service staff (desk people, etc) were very friendly. The other staff however, were fairly rude and dismissive if spoken to. We enjoyed our room, which was a King Suite. However, the shower was HORRIBLE. No water pressure at all. 

We dined at the Restaurant one time for breakfast, and the food was decent. Having to flag down a waitress after waiting for 5 to 10 minutes was no fun. 

Overall, for the price, I would stay here again. If I didn't get as good of a deal, I would think twice however."
__label__5	Fave new hot pot spot  would definitely comes back  the staff have been super nice and the establishment is clean and organized
__label__5	I rarely get manicures or pedicures. But because of a special family event this weekend, I just got both at the nail House. What a fantastic experience. Halima was truly the best nail technician I have ever experienced. She did a thorough job, and is very professional. Thanks to her amazing technique, I will increase my nail services! The place is very clean and friendly.
__label__5	Good Healthy food, great atmosphere, and great customer service.  I ordered beef kabab meal, came with salad, veggies, hummus, and rice.  I am always looking for places that have healthy dishes and this is definitely one.  They use premium beef, and you can tell, it was great.  They also have great healthy drinks, not just soda. Coming back soon.
__label__4	The service was fast and the coffee was good, BUT it was very overpriced. I have never had coffee that has cost​ me $9 for a latte that tasted quite normal. However, it was a really yummy latte, but you can probably get a similar​ elsewhere. The flavors sound unique on the menu​ but just taste like a normal vanilla or caramel.
__label__5	My family and I haven't dined out much due to covid, tonight we had the pleasure of being waited on by the awesome Mr. Earl he was so kind and patient as well as anticipated several of our needs with a picky toddler in our party! When he bought out those awesome cheddar biscuits he also bought her a plate of sliced oranges . He went on to wow us the whole night, we raved about his service to an awesome attentive manager Juan. Thanks again everyone who made this night out for us one to remember!!
__label__4	Piping hot delicious beignets at 3 for $4. The can of 11% Underwood Rosé was $9, a pecan tart was $4.29 and a small chicory coffee was about $4. Pecan tart was good. Rose obviously overpriced but I didn't ask and was already a couple sheets to the wind at 1pm so just handed my card over...oops. You gotta try this place's beignets though!
__label__3	"Most of the staff are great. Not a big fan of Corinn. The rooms are ok. The ""queen"" bed is definitely NOT a queen. The housekeeping only comes once a week. What? Not a fan that either."
__label__4	"After a late night in the French Quarter, (is there any other kind) a breakfast at Jimmy J's is the perfect medicine.

This is a small hole in the wall a few blocks from Bourbon St. with great service, good food, and a tremendous bloody Mary.

The kitchen is small so it takes a bit for the food to arrive, but the friendly servers keep the Bloody's, coffee, and juice coming until the food arrives.   They have a really nice assortment of entries and portions are big, just right to get the day going and take the edge off."
__label__5	This is an amazing find. The gyro was so good lots of flavor and spices. The Owner was very nice and accommodating. We order one regular gyro with fries and told him we were just going to split it. He gave us an extra piece of pita bread without us even asking. It was very nice and thoughtful. Will definitely be going back many times! Stop by and try it. You won't be disappointed :)
__label__4	"Decided to give this place a try again, and this time, it did not disappoint.  Maybe the first time when I went, I chose the wrong donuts or what not, but this time, we chose all the right ones!  We had the following:

- Buttermilk Biscuits
- Cereal & Milk Donut
- Coffee Cake Donut
- Salty Dog Donut

All was really delicious, and cannot wait to come back to try their other donuts!"
__label__5	The mex coffee is delicious and the zucchini and carrot muffins are the the staff is always friendly
__label__2	"It's not inedibly bad, more like just-below-average but a huge disappointment since they're on TV. Everything is drowning in sauce which is your first clue that a BBQ joint makes crummy food. Like my dear friend's pappy used to say, ""you can't polish a turd""."
__label__5	I have had total knee replacement last year.  This year I had surgery on my neck for a ruptured disc and  bulging  disc on my neck. Every one there is friendly. I have my favorite physical therapist. They have him me so much in the past and now I am using them for the surgery I just had for the ruptured disc . If you're looking for physical therapy center the best place to go at Star Physical Therapy I go to the one on Main Street.
__label__5	I was here for a wedding last year and it was amazing. I loved the setup and how they had little separate rooms. The food was excellent and it was my first time trying Uzbekistan cuisine. My review might be a little biased since I did not go here as a customer. However, the waitstaff taking care of the whole event were excellent and they managed a large party very efficiently.
__label__4	"Family style dining, you will never leave hungry. Something for every one, from meats to veggies to breads to desserts!! Good home cooking and plenty of it. It is what it is Southern home cooking and very good service, everyone nice and very friendly.
A family tradition. Have to like the family style dining to really enjoy the whole experience.
Give it a try!"
__label__4	Pretty cool cafe, banana nut pancakes are awesome along with the samoa cookie latte. Everyone seemed pretty up beat so early in the morning and it only got busier the longer we were there. It being an old house there's not a ton of seating but there were tables outside to take on the crowd.
__label__5	Not only is Dr. Dougherty a well-trained, experienced orthodontist, her entire staff ensures the care and treatment received will be professional with outstanding results.  The team is focused on providing individualized care and does so with professionalism, humor and kindness. Their services are current and cutting edge, offering several options that take into consideration the financial concerns and Orthodontic needs of the patient and the family. My daughter has a beautiful smile and I am grateful! I highly recommend Dougherty Orthodontics and encourage those needing Ortho services to schedule a consult.
__label__5	Very unique place, overall it was a great experience! Simple service and atmosphere, but the food was out of this world and made up for it. Make sure you try desserts!
__label__5	"Our favorite. Pizza and pasta as good as anywhere in Philadelphia.  The pasta is especially good-- all of them. The staff is also very friendly and helpful.  

 Not to be missed!"
__label__5	J Scott did an amazing job on our side walkway, I would highly recommend them! Very professional, fair pricing, and they were quick and efficient. The whole process was a breeze and we are very happy with the results.
__label__4	Great food and it has the same type of food taco trucks have but not really your Texas authentic street taco truck type of place. Its a more modern place with a little bit of twist on their foods. To me, its not an authentic mexican spot if they don't have Torta's because thats my favorite but doesn't mean I won't come back.
__label__5	"Have been to Pochi several times for dinner & once for drinks and appetizers. The restaurant is small but has the feel of a big city hidden gem. 
The empanadas are delicious and the hearts of palm salad is by far my favorite item on the menu. Nice wine list.
Dining room can get a little loud & tables are a bit close but the service & food definitely outweigh this minor issue. Highly recommend."
__label__5	Hands down the most delicious avocado toast I've ever had... Loved the addition of feta/spinach cream cheese! Service was friendly & accommodating.
__label__4	Great happy hour.  Good food, good beer selection, pretty good prices.  Very friendly staff, too.  My only complaint is that it is always ridiculously packed, and the people that go there are way too hipster for my liking.
__label__4	"I'm so glad that Sasha's opened up this second location.

The larger space is fantastic - especially the non-smoking side, which is the worst part about the Demun location.

The salads are super tasty. Outside of that, I have only tried the pizza at this location. We got a really simple one-topping meat pizza but it was good nonetheless.

The staff at this location seems more put together than the other. (Less dancing, shot-taking and all around weird ambience.)"
__label__4	"I was craving for some nice Asian food and found this spot nearby my hotel.
So, I ran over and ordered my favorite ... the rice vermicelli with spring rolls and meat special.
The restaurant was so adorable that I wish I had time to just sit there and enjoy the decor.
I m hoping to have another Tampa trip
Soon so that I can try more items in the menu."
__label__5	It's a chain restaurant but it's good!! We liked everything we ordered especially the potato salad and Mac and cheese sides. The mac and cheese was my favorite side for sure. The desserts are also very good and of course the chicken is great! I got no spice just because that's to my liking but my dad got spice and he enjoyed it very much while my boyfriend thought the lowest spice heat was a bit too spicy so I think it really depends on who you are!
__label__5	I was looking for a place to remove my acrylics which were starting to separate from my real nails. I was willing to get a new full set but really wanted to save my real nails which were now long. My nail tech was incredibly nice we soaked my acrylics off and I got dip powder on my real nails.
__label__5	We love love love Noble Crust.  It is our favorite Friday night Date Night spot. The bartender Chris always makes us feel welcome and creates the most incredible cocktails for us. We love the meatballs and the fried chicken is out of this world.
__label__4	Very happy I found this place! I love Indian cuisine.  In this area, this is some of the best.   Chicken tikka masala, paneer masala, gobi 65.  All incredibly well done.  Best Indian since California!
__label__5	I went to this place last night with some friends. Loved  it. The margaritas are AMAZING! Pro tip: go top shelf tequila. They have a dj playing, which can be a bit annoying if you are trying to have a conversation,  but at least he played good music. The service is good, friendly wait staff and bartenders. I will definitely be going here again, especially for the $2 dollar taco Tuesday.
__label__4	All my favorite menu items are here, just like the flag ship location in Ybor city in Tampa. Coming here before my flight give me one more chance to have the delicious 1916 salad, with a frosty local made beer. What a delightful place to visit, before departing Tampa.
__label__4	Wings are amazing. Service not the best. Atmosphere is uncomfortable. If you want to watch sports this is a great location.
__label__5	Best seafood platters in town. Ask for tartar sauce. Chocolate pecan dessert is amazing! The bourbon milk drink is fantastic! Service superb! Request a window table.
__label__1	This was the worst hotel experience of my life. I had made a reservation on line a week prior to arrival and stated that I was traveling with my pet bunny and I had a confirmation code. Upon arrival I was turned away from the hotel due to my pet. They are unprofessional and are liars.
__label__5	Our visit was very nice. We did not have reservations but were seated right away. My friend and I each did the chocolate and wine tasting. Omg wine paired perfect with the chocolates. My other friend drank the sangrias and she enjoyed them. Our waitress was really nice and her knowledge made our experience better. I would return and recommend to everyone to come here.
__label__4	Came here for dinner the other week when I was in town for work. Brussels sprouts were delicious & the gyro was okay. I thought the fries would come on the side, but they're in the sandwich (so I probably misread). Service was great though, the woman who was my waitress was very friendly, and was that way with everyone who came in. I'd return and try some other dishes if I was in the area again.
__label__4	I loved this salon and I love Marina. She's super smart and talented and makes you feel safe in her care. She takes her job personally and pours her hear into it and it shows. She's not scared to take extra time to make everything perfect just for you, at least that's what she did for me. The overall price was more than I would have liked to spend but I guess because it's Santa Barbara then that's the price everyone pays.
__label__2	Bartender was the only service and he got overwhelmed when more people came.  My burrito was hard and crunchy. Probably frozen and defrosted in oven.  Absolutely no moisture. Maybe the worse burrito I had in a while.
__label__5	Love, Love, Love the  food!! The food is always  excellent and the service is always great.  Brandon is the best and provides the best suggestions and wonderful service.  He recommended the potato salad...and now I think I have found my new favorite.  thanks Brandon!!
__label__1	"This place is NOT closed. They just changed it's name to ""Bellevue West"" because of all the issues that come along with this place and it's very rude, unprofessional staff. Trust me and anyone who has ever rented here. GO SOMEWHERE ELSE! SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
__label__4	Food was delicious especially them gator bites and crab cakes my waiter was nice but extremely slow I wld definately come bac our drinks was good also especially my tropical storm u also receive a desert or wine if u Yelp which is great
__label__1	They over charge & the women on front desk have a bad attitude on 2 locations including the fact that they are not cheap at all. I will not be giving them my hard earned money and I always shop around. Plenty of mechanics with decent rates & good attitudes out there. :)
__label__5	Love this place! I came looking for a prom dress and was able to find one. The sales associate was very attentive throughout the entire process. I would most definitely recommend David's to my friends and family!
__label__5	Melissa was our server tonight and was absolutely amazing. The food was great. We ate grilled octopus, roll eggplant with feta cheese, kroku sandwich... all of these was more than our expectations. Definitely we will be come back. A great spot in Ybor City.
__label__5	I don't understand all the bad reviews on this place. If it's so bad then why is it always so packed??  We're here once a week! Best omelets ever!! A little pricy but it's worth it! The portion sizes are good too!!
__label__5	Love it here!!! My dad (who is super picky and high maintenance) had a great experience while he was traveling so I had to check it out. I had a great facial and want to come back for the other spa services!
__label__3	Uber eats starting to suck. Last 4orders had something missing or wrong all together.
__label__5	Chinese cuisine at it best full service  restaurant relaxing  atmosphere friendly  service! Genuine chinese atmosphere at reasonable prices that won't break the wallet.
__label__3	Nice place, cool atmosphere and good location. Came in on a Friday a little after noon. Got seated either away and greeting staff was very friendly. But the service was slow, almost picked up and left. 10 minutes before someone came over to see me, another 10 to get a single beer and food took another 35 minutes after that. People seated after me got food before me. Never understand that. I ordered oysters and so did they. I am watching them eat them as I write this sitting at a table void of any food.
__label__5	The hospice team at Assisted is truly extraordinary. Thank you to every nurse, social worker, spiritual counselor, and home health aide for being so compassionate and giving!
__label__1	Does anyone know the last name of the property manager, Michelle, who works there now?
__label__5	I was visiting Urbanoutfitters HQ when I discovered this place after taking a little stroll. Amazing sandwich with juicy and tender pork on top of amazing bread and sharp cheese. Must-try!!!!
__label__1	I went in with measurements to buy an inside mail slot. The man was very abrupt, said he had one size larger than my measuerements, but it would work. He was very unfriendly and abrupt. He gave me the mail slot, but acted like I was bothering him. When I Got home, it did Not fit the slot. He apparently never looked at the measurements That I showed him.
__label__5	I have never had such a tasty gourmet burger like the Mission Burger! My guy had the Montecito and couldn't stop extolling its deliciousness. Not to mention French fries that were crispy, creamy and perfectly seasoned. I don't give reviews often--and this time I couldn't help myself!! Ate way too much because everything was so great!
__label__5	Dr. Volpe is the best and his staff is great! The doctor is always in control, extremely knowledgable and professional.  The ladies behind the desk are funny and personable. I've never had one unpleasant visit to this office and I've been a patient since he's moved his practice there.
__label__5	Simply put, SCD is the best deli I have ever been to! So glad to have this local treat within walking distance of where we live, and we visit almost weekly these days. Always busy (glad to see it!), but efficiently moving orders quickly both online and walk-up orders. Service is always great, even when it is total chaos lunch rush. Breakfast sandwiches are amazing, as are their lunch salads, sandwiches, and paninis. The hardest part about coming here is making a decision as to what I want to order with so many delicious options!
__label__1	This place is gross. Always smells like armpits and feet. The games are all broken down or just plain steal your coin. The staff is practically useless, all a bunch of high school kids on their cell phones, and the food looks like something out of a prison. do not go here!
__label__5	Surprise Surprise.  My wife and I finally got around to checking this place out Saturday night and I cannot believe how good the food was. Scratch made Chinese food.  My wife had the vegetarian low mein noodles and I had the eggplant/tofu in black bean sauce.  This is hands down the best Chinese either one of us has ever had.  We just became regulars. Oh, don't sleep in the pot sticker apps either. YUM.
__label__5	Nice hole in the wall!! Love this place just very hot and need to work on the A/C. Food was amazing
__label__5	Mission Taco is and probably will always be my go-to. The service is always very good and the prices are great as well. They have happy hour after 10pm every day, which serves $2 tacos so it's perfect for a late-night snack! I have found no other place like Mission Taco, and ever since being introduced to it less than a year ago, I have been there countless times. I 100% recommend that you spend your money here (and try the habanero shrimp taco). You will be getting wonderful servers and some amazing street tacos.
__label__5	FANTASTIC PLACE! They were so kind and talented. I won't go anywhere else in New Orleans now.
__label__2	The business man sitting next to the buffet gets a star for outstanding service. The servers were so busy gossiping he helped lead me to the buffet and seating. The hostess was quite occupied writing the breafast specials on the sandwich board at 8 oclock, 2 hours after they opened for service. Only 4 tables in restaurant and everyone is waiting to pay. Food was limited but tasty. Awful service.
__label__3	"I really hate buying from here. Mainly because the quality is so shitty, but I also just needed some plain, basic camis for under all my sheer tops, and I love that they are under $3 each, so I could care less if they tear, rip or fall apart, for $3, you have them SOLD!!

I bought all the basic colors and feel like I spent less than I would have at the GAP on 1 CAMI!!

Bargain!!"
__label__5	This is one of the best wine bars I have been to. Today was my first time coming here since they had just opened up recently. The service was beyond amazing. The staff was very helpful and had a lot of knowledge. The atmosphere was light. The food came out in really good time even with them being busy. The bruschetta plate with a combination of choices was amazing. The goat cheese meatballs were delicious. The wine was also outstanding! I am definitely coming back!
__label__5	Wonderful service and great food. Was asked whether we were celebrating but woken say don't save this place for a celebration - the crab cakes will give you occasion to celebrate ! Steak cooked perfectly and a server who gave us a history lesson about the area. A perfect evening  can also recommend the appetizer to share so you why to taste the crab cake, clams, calamari and some heavenly prawns wrapped in bacon in a sweet smokey sauce - yum!
__label__5	Went here to get the original Muffuletta and it did not disappoint! Sandwich is fantastic and service while in the deli was outstanding! Can't wait to be back in New Orleans to get another sandwich or two.
__label__1	"My 3rd trip here...Came with a group of 7...maybe 3 tables were seated. Took approximately 2 hrs to order, eat and pay our tab. I ordered the fajita burrito and it was covered in what tasted like white American cheese. Steak was bland and the veggies were ok. Friend had the super burrito, also known as a plate of lettuce and shredded cheese. I'm not really sure the point of that...anyway. Chicken wings were alright. Jerk sauce was tasty with a little heat.

Would I come back? probably not,"
__label__5	Oh My Gosh, so much fun. I have always loved glass and have watched glassblowing demos before but I never imagined that I would be able to participate. The owners and staff were very friendly and, of course, knowledgable. They explained my role and what I would be doing very clearly. I felt safe the entire time. Can't wait to pick up my vase.
__label__4	"Great ambiance, friendly staff, delicious food. 

Singapore Noodles are very nice... and spicy. 

My brother had the Duck Boudin & Fried Green Tomatoes... he was not a fan."
__label__4	I was on the fence about this place. From the outside, it looked super dark and wasn't sure what I was walking into. We sat at the bar and had a few drinks. Our bartender was really friendly. It's a real chill, laid back kind of place. Once we got our drinks, the bartender wasn't in our face all the time asking if we wanted anything else like some other bars I go to. While we didn't have anything to eat, the food looked and smelled delicious, especially the mussels. Will try them the next time.
__label__5	Wonderful reputation and well deserved! We went late afternoon on a Friday, right after we got into town. We sat at the bar and had a great experience. Very friendly and knowledgeable bartender, delicious alligator bites, and of course, a Hurricane. I'd had one before, but my husband hadn't. It was a great way to introduce him to New Orleans! We even came back later for dessert: bread pudding and Hurricane cheesecake because we couldn't decide. :-) We'll likely be back for a full meal this week and again in the future.
__label__5	Love going here for sushi! Prices for all you can eat is reasonable and the staff is friendly and nice. If you ask to change an order they will listen to what you want and will do their best to get the sushi to your liking. One of the best sushi places I've been to.
__label__5	Love this bar, great food, good times, and the bartender Amanda is a rockstar!!! My girlfriend and I go every Monday, and look forward to see our favorite people. I'm a bartender myself and can be a tough person to wait on, the staff is very helpful and professional always. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for good food and an even better experience with the staff.
__label__5	I loved it, I took my boyfriend their to celebrate his birthday, and everything was phenomenal!! The Jumbo buffalo shrimp were AMAZING, and the flat bread was amazing! The lighting was beautiful, and the service was superb, go go go and stop reading this!!!
__label__5	"By far the best place to see an ample sized show in the city.  R5 and Four Corners have done it again with consistency, focused on laid back vibes with quality service.  

I have seen a number of shows at Union Transfer and think it will finally be the catalyst to bring this area of Spring Garden up to snuff w/ its neighboring locales."
__label__2	"Driver needs to loosen up his attitude. I didn't pay $500 to get a fucking lecture about timeliness. If we could've gotten their earlier we would have.

I'm not in high school and you don't get to scold me for being 5 minutes late.

I get you have a time schedule to keep but please stop treating your customers like children."
__label__5	Ask for Joe! It's clear that he is very detailed and meticulous in his work, and he gives a lot of great insight into what looks good on you. I loved that he suggested how to style my haircut based on my face shape. He's a gem! Also, very cheap haircut ($18) for wash, cut, and style!
__label__5	"Le Pig MAC is not your ordinary Big Mac.
WOW!!!!!
Service was very friendly!!!
I wish I had the C Butcher close to my house.
That's how good it is!!!!!!"
__label__1	"Service department charged my mother $53 to change a tail light bulb.  The service agent Tim indicated this was not a bad price considering most local mechanics charge $150 per hour.  There was no repair to the light.  They changed a light bulb.  That's it.  No more.  No less.  Unbelievable and disgraceful.   

Be warned."
__label__5	After living in very German Cincinnati, OH for six years, you could imagine the treat it was to find this place. Trivia (and other board games) on the table for you to play, delicious German food and beer, it is my happy place. The potato pancakes are some of the best I have ever tasted in my life, just as good as Oktoberfest.
__label__1	This place needs a lot of work. The service was unbelievably slow. What they call a panini is just a regular sandwich on toast. The pancakes were burnt. And no one even apologized.
__label__4	Got the drunken noodle. It was just the right level of spiciness. There could have been more noodles, but it was nice to have lots of vegetables. Good price as well.
__label__1	"I scheduled an appointment with Diane for a custom wedding band for my fiancé and the staff there had initially been very helpful. But through the course of a few months we have not heard back once. I have called and gone in to the store and always been met with the response, ""we have just been so busy right now."" The store has been completely unprofessional and left us out to dry. More communication, even when busy, would have been appreciated. Do not recommend for custom pieces."
__label__3	I've eaten at this location numerous times and this is the first time I've had reason to complain.  I ordered my dish mild but got spicy. The music is way too loud in my opinion but maybe the girl just wasn't listening. Also my rice seemed dried out and sort of crunchy.  I went back for a refill of tea but it was gone. I waited a few minutes to see if someone would bring it back out but eventually gave up and left. Parking really sucks at this location. I typically have to park behind the building and walk up the street.
__label__5	Family friendly dining area.  Food & service was very good. Live music started in the bar around 9p which you could enjoy in the dining area too. Great local hang out.
__label__4	In Philadelphia rivals Dandelion as an authentic British pub. 7 British beers on draft. Extensive menu. Great for Old City!
__label__5	Amazing freshly in-house pasteurized handmade ice cream! ONLY PLACE IN ARIZONA!!! THE SCREAMERY!! FIVE STARS! Excellent customer service too!
__label__5	I had eaten at the one in South Reno, and was pleased they opened up in my neighborhood.  Only eaten there once, but we were very impressed.  The food was outstanding, and the attention to the customer was better!  I ate a chili that was giving me distress (my fault), and they spotted it immediately.  They gave me some drinks to ease the pain.  Took the burn away immediately.  We will absolutely be back.  We will try different things, as they suggested.
__label__3	A lot to look through! A large selection, mostly older records. But, check this place out if you have the time to look through everything, you might just find something hidden in the stacks! Nice staff too.
__label__4	This place is the BOMB!! Presentation of the food was fabulous, the taste and favours were amazing.  Our 11 person group age ranged from 8 to 82, everyone was extremely please and stuffed when we left.  Service was great.  Don't miss going the the East.
__label__5	We have used them for 10 years. When we had a problem they came out within an hour and had it fixed in a hour. On a hot day, the tech was a goodsend. Very happy with their service
__label__5	"I had read the reviews before I went and they were 50/50. My experience was excellent! We only did sushi, and it was GREAT! Fresh, and one of the best in the area.

Our server, ""Yuki"" was amazing! No complaints from ""This Girl."""
__label__4	Great food had the toasted raviolis they were good my first time having toasted raviolis so had nothing to compare them to. The vegetarian pizza was awesome the pizza crust was thick, but delicious and not heavy . The caprese salad fresh and seasoned well, good wine choices. For desserts we tried the cannolis and a donut kind of thing deep fried  bread dipped in honey with powdered sugar . The service was attentive and helpful. If I lived in the state I would  definitely come back .
__label__1	"Having been waiting a year for help with our yard. Once I put a bad review they called (Rick manager) and said he would be out yesterday. 
We still have not seen him and nothing is done to our yard. Don't pay a year in advance like us cause you will be stuck."
__label__3	Staff members are super nice and friendly. It's really easy and convenient to get an appointment. I like the online reservation system, very simple to use.
__label__5	"Wow! Terrific place. Tried 3 of the tasty tapas style dishes. 3 is just enough to feed 2 people I suppose. A little pricey but filled with great taste!

The owners/bartenders were very friendly to me & my lady friend as we were sitting comfortably at the bar. The one fellow made good suggestions for me on scotch and for her on red wine. We were both very happy with recommends. Obviously very knowledgeable on everything they serve.

Probably won't go back for the tapas as often but love the atmosphere for an evening drink with a friend. Great mature crowd. 

Cheers!"
__label__5	I have yet to have bad meal at this place. Great cheese selection and I love how the menu changes with the seasons.
__label__2	Although the food is good, the restaurant management is terrible! They overbooked large, loud groups the evening we dined there. You couldn't even talk to others at your table because the large loud group that was seated next to us was so loud. Instead of asking them to quiet down so as not to disturb the other diners, we were told there was nothing they could do.  A number of diners left the restaurant because of this.
__label__4	"Seasons 52 back today. Had to wait for about 20 to 30 min to be sat for lunch. They did make up for it by giving us a free flatbread app. Server was very good. Fish Tacos were great, roasted potatoes were lacking flavor. Bison Burger was good not great. For the money lacks, flavor and portion ( yes they are low cal = small portion ). We happen to have a gift card otherwise would have ended up some place ele.

Fish tacos
Bison burger
2 roasted potato sides
2 sodas
2 desserts
37$ + tip"
__label__3	"The food is very good! If I was only rating the food it would be 5 stars, the yellow curry is phenomenal and the crab Rangoon too 

But the service was HORRIBLE!!!! We had to ask 3 times for them to refill our drink and they never did. They brought out our appetizer (5 Rangoon puffs) after sitting here for 30 mins, and got our main course after being here for an hour. 
Good food, I will only order OUT from this restaurant i couldn't sit here very much longer"
__label__4	Fabulous! It's really one of those places I feel like I can bring anyone, and they'll find something they want to eat and be happy. I love that I can bring my picky eater little brother here - and I love that I can take a lunch break with a friend here and be in and out in an hour feeling calm and refreshed and for not too much dough. But most importantly, I think their milkshakes are the best ever, so much so that I will sometimes try to convince myself it's warmer out than it is simply to justify the treat.
__label__5	"Sarai is amazing! She was my go-to for cut and color when I lived in Tampa! 

I have a full head of curls and it usually intimidates some stylists. She was always great at delivering what I asked for. 

She is patient, gives advice, and talks you through each step as she goes. Unfortunately, I moved out of state but if I'm back in Tampa for a visit, I'll be making an appointment!"
__label__5	My dog recently had surgery here by Dr. Shields. She spent a lot of time with me explaining options and all potential charges. I was never pressured to spend more than I thought necessary. All the staff were professional and kind. The hospital and waiting room was spotless. My phone calls were returned promptly. I can't say enough about the quality of my dogs care.
__label__5	Amazing fresh in house made pasta! The Bucatini al Amatricana (sp?) is literally the best pasta I have ever eaten. I have ordered it other places and it doesn't even compare. The pizza's are wonderful and the in house made gelato is also to die for! Service is always great, the only downfall is you can't make a reservation so bigger parties may have to wait a while to get a table.
__label__5	Excellent food, great service, beautiful restaurant. Pricey, but worth every penny. What more can I say.
__label__3	Good and cheap rental car but they don't want to give you the yelp deal at check in they say you have to do it before you come to the rental location but then it wouldn't be a check in offer. they were friendly and the cars were clean and they are reasonable priced.
__label__5	The folks that work there are so nice and really know there stuff!
__label__5	Great all around American  diner food. Favorite breakfast place because of prices, tons of menu options and casual setting. This is my go to place for Sunday brunch!
__label__5	Very amazing place to it. Completely misjudged from the outside it doesn't look like much but the food and the service were amazing . The host (greeter) robert I do believe was his name put the icing on the cake . He made the experience a total success...you might ask yourself really? It's just a Waffle House? But I would disagree...it's like eating at grandmas house you feel like family...but you don't have to take my word for it! Try it for yourself....amazing....
__label__4	"I come from a part of the country where there is a lot of Thai food.  This is by far the closest to ""home"".  The fact that the food is ordered based on a spiciness scale makes it more authentic.  
  The Pad Thai is wonderful.  My husband ordered the curry Thai and he recommends ordering extra meat.  It's only $3.50 for extra meat."
__label__4	Stopped in while in Phila for some dim sum here. Yummy soup dumplings. Loved the shumai which was different than I've ever had elsewhere. We also tried a few other things but those two were the most memorable. Would recommend (however parking nearby is hard to find so we ended up parking in a lot that was almost as expensive as our dim sum!)!
__label__5	Hands down best place for a foodie!! Wow! Try it! If you like unique flavors and delicious food, you will not be disappointed! The cauliflower and short ribs are to die for! The beet salad is the best I have ever had! Everything is fresh and made in house! Five glowing stars!
__label__5	"The BEST burgers in town... And those garlic fries .. O.M.G!!!! Fast and
Yummy and I like the outdoor seating area!"
__label__5	"I love this place! Came here for lunch couple of weeks back. Love the fact that they have more than just poke haha
The poke bowl seems small but it is very filling and there are so many toppings to choose from. I also got free soup because I was dining in which is always a plus!
Overall, my experience was great! It was very satisfying and this is my new fav poke spot in town"
__label__5	Awesome customer service. Needed 3 appointments for myself and 2 friends. We were visiting from out of town and called for same day appointments. They were so accommodating to fit us all in, even staying late to finish our nails. Great service and attention to detail. Highly recommend.
__label__5	This is one of my most favorite restaurants. Their Fettuccine Alfredo is the best Alfredo sauce I've ever had. Family-owned feel, friendly wait staff, and laid back atmosphere. I recommend this restaurant regularly.
__label__5	Still love this place! I now live about a 10 minutes walk away. The roast pork sandwich is so delicious and flavorful - highly recommend!  And as always, the fried pickles are to die for!
__label__5	My favorite plant shop in all of boise. The staff is really nice and can help you with anything you need. Coming here is having a bright, happy, and good time. Cannot come here and be sad.
__label__5	The BEST oriental food i've ever had!!! I ordered beef and broccoli, the beef was melt in your mouth tender. The pot stickers were fantastic!! Service was good, wait time for food was 10 min max, very affordable! I could keep going! So yummy!!!
__label__3	Gumbo, jambalaya, and complimentary bread were good.  I've had better and worse elsewhere.  Waiter was knowledgeable.  Quite a line the night we went but it moved quickly.  The rest of my party enjoyed it more than I did.  They aren't as familiar with New Orleans food.
__label__1	"Update- I never got my refund even though he told he refunded me. So I was charged $51 for a halfass order. 
Sorry for the language. Never ordering from here again."
__label__5	I worked with Svetlana to provide a gift to my parents and have their house cleaned post-party. Svetlana was very nice and accommodating. My parents were ecstatic with the results of Natasha's work...good price and very good results with great customer service. Thank you again!!
__label__1	Deserves zero stars and pricey! $$$ The food was horrible, tasted like hospital cafeteria food, no joke. We ordered 3 different things from the dinner menu tonight all items fish and steak over cooked and tough, greasy and bland. We will not be back. The view and presentation was beautiful. Such a huge disappointment!
__label__4	Service was top notch.  Was here for my daughter's sixteenth birthday.  Decor, atmosphere, service, was perfect.  The food was amazing!  Each bite burst with flavor.  Food was fresh and savory.  Each dish was spectacular.  We will be back!
__label__4	"Great happy hour for drinks and apps. Tasty food and tastier drinks. 

Normal menu isn't really my jam and a little more than I want to pay for something I'm not really excited about."
__label__4	We were here end of May.  Very good food and an amazing Prickly Pear Margarita.  The service was slow which was surprising based on the time we came, because it really wasn't very busy.  But it was a very good meal.  Had service been a tad better I would give it a 5 star!  But overall a great meal.
__label__5	While driving down the coast, we stopped here while driving through Santa Barbara (just because we saw how popular it was). We ordered an appetizer and 3 dinners amongst the two of us and I wish we had enough room in our stomachs to finish because it was the best Mexican food id ever had
__label__4	"So many talk about Soho Sushi, but I had yet to try it.  Was there on a Saturday night, so there was a bit of a wait, but my friends and I got a bottle of wine from the bar and chilled outside.  

Sushi was very good- though I still think Samurai Blue has the best in Tampa.  Waitstaff was very friendly.  Even after I spilled my wine (oops).  

Get the tuna nachos- definitely a novelty here...something you can't find at other places."
__label__3	Food was pretty ordinary and plain, for breakfast fare.  Toast came unbuttered which was disaspointing.  Solid place for breakfast if your in  the area as it was clean and decor was interesting, but, I would not travel far out of my way.
__label__5	Thanks for another great season. Enjoyed everything wish I could get your produce all year long.Thanks for all your hard work.Thanks Bill S.
__label__5	Awesome. Saved me every morning with their cold brew. The guys there really know their coffee.
__label__1	"The food is descent,but don't go if you are alternative or different in any way. I never complain but this is necessary. The ladies are nice,but the male server would never give me a drink with my meal,and was just horrible. I asked twice but got ignored.I had finished all of it without a drink. The people in front of and behind me got refills! I had better service at taco bell. The manager was no help either
 He didn't care it seems. Save your money!"
__label__5	A great group dinner!  Food was awesome. Our server, John, was helpful and had a lot of fun with us!  He had great recommendations, gave us coffee refills to go on our walk. Could not recommend this more highly.
__label__4	Came here for lunch on my last day in NOLA and it was well worth it. I had the taste of New Orleans which was big enough for 2 and gave you a sample of New Orleans favorites. I also went with the 3 oyster appetizer which was extremely good. Service was good and food was better. Overall great experience and would go back. Only negative thing I had to mention were the prrices were a bit steep for lunch
__label__3	I came to Hiro Asian for lunch yesterday and thought the food was just OK. The ambience is cute, the location is ok, street parking in downtown Saint Louis. I ordered the tofu ramen. Although there was a large portion and there were a lot of mushroom, tofu, and veggi's, the broth tasted bland to me. The server also was not very attentive and we were the only ones at the restaurant. I probably would try another place for ramen in the future.
__label__1	Went here once & never will I go again. A friend told me they had a good breakfast menu so I tried it out. Service was horrible, place was unclean, and the food was nasty. I ordered scrambled eggs & hashbrowns. The eggs tasted like they came out of a jug and the hashbrowns were mushy & watery! Not the typical crispy hashbrowns EVERY other place has. Waffle House is definitely better for breakfast food late night.
__label__5	So fresh!  Better than chipotle.  The bowl and empanada was delish.  I got it through uber eats, their packaging holds the heat just like it was made in front of you.  Guacamole is homemade and super yummy!
__label__5	Good salads & pizzas, local wine, really friendly waiter, water for kids w/ lids, crayons and coloring sheets (keys to success right there).   More creative and aesthetically pleasing than most of the places in our area we've tried so far.  Definitely coming back.
__label__5	Great pancakes and even better service!! This place is perfect for breakfast. The biscuits and gravy will fill anyone up. The french toast will satisfy any craving. It's all good food. A great local restaurant.
__label__5	Food was amazing. We had burgers and BBQ. Don't forget the milkshakes--they are wonderful. Highly recommend High Baby's
__label__2	"I called these guys because of their great reviews on Yelp.  But my experience didn't match the positive reviews on here.

I found them to be unprofessional and a bit rude.  They were also supposed to call me back but never did.  Interestingly ""Dan"" one of the owners was really unprofessional-- if the owner is unprofessional that's a BAD sign.

Also makes me wonder how many of these 5 star reviews are legit...  

Oh well..."
__label__2	The locals looove this place...although I'm not sure why.  Maybe they dont know any better.  This is your average burger/shake joint that is on every corner in So Cal.  Nothing fantastic. Maybe living in the heat and humidity makes this place more appealing to the locals.  When you feel like having a burger and a shake..this is a good alternative to McDonalds.
__label__5	Both hand pulled and shaved noodles are amazing! Don't miss out on their bubble tea and fluffy ice either.
__label__4	The banh mi is quite flavorful and delicious. I also picked up a Taro milk tea and it was quite good. I probably should have ordered 2 banh mi's because one just wasn't filling enough for me. Next time I will give the BBQ pork a try.
__label__4	Although the place is generally crowded (good sign of a great restaurant), they do have very good sushi. I could go just for the Buckley role, it's by far my favorite hand roll they have.
__label__5	Great little local shop.  The coffee is excellent & sourced from an Idaho roaster.  The pastries are also baked in house daily.  Tina is great & very friendly.  The atmosphere is modern & clean, but has a modest DIY feel at the same time.  It's location is a little off the beaten path, but that's also what I kind of like about it, because in this area the closest place to get coffee is Moxie, which I have always found mediocre at best.  Super stoked to have found this place, I encourage everyone to check it out!
__label__5	Ate at bar tonight. Good clean cuts  of fish. Place was busy but my food was made within 2 mInutes of ordering. Had a roll, hand roll, and nigiri all good portions of fish. Pleasant Staff. Sushi chef knew how to hand roll. Will be going back
__label__1	Not sure if these guys are racist or have something against big people as we did not get greeted or told about their specials but the minute a thin caucasian couple walked he greeted them and told them of the specials and offered his assistance. Fine, I will take my business else where then since my miney is obviously not welcomed here.
__label__5	We were in no rush but Chris provided next day service and we couldn't have been any more pleased. Having just moved to Tucson she also was invaluable in offering up local advise on a variety of topics. We both highly recommend her and the price was excellent as well!
__label__4	"Reasons to like Pearl St:
(1) They have freaking $1 beer on Tuesdays. And it's not the cheap stuff, it's Bell's, Sun King, and Fat Tire.  
(2) They have pizza.  And it's pretty tasty.  It's definitely on the spicy side though, even the margherita had quite a kick to it.
(3) Really nice, fast service. (Although we were the only table there)

I will definitely be back! Cause I never say no to $1 beer, and you shouldn't either."
__label__5	"Some gal pals and I had brunch here and were seated pretty quickly on a Saturday morning! Our waitress, Anya, was super helpful and knew all about the menu. We each loved our meals and the vibe of our room. What a fun hidden gem in University City! 

The Tex Mex Breakfast was on point and had just enough spice/kick (but not tooo spicy). I didn't get the potatoes but everyone else said they were perfectly seasoned & sauteed."
__label__5	AMAZING ABSOLUTELY PERFECT! Five stars for sure! Took my boyfriend for Thai food for the first time here and he ate it in seconds! It was by far the most traditional tasting Thai food I have had in Florida so far! Their curry is to die for and I wouldn't recommend any other place! The service was beyond any other experience as well!
__label__5	Oh my, we could not have asked for a better trip and tour guide! Steven took us to three private wineries; no other people onsite except our group - and a terrific cross-section of experiences. Great wine and good too!  I cannot say enough good things about this tour from start to finish! They deserve all 5*; this tour is A+++++!!
__label__2	Ordered the standard got the junior. Not good. Makes me crazy that they don't write down your order. Used to be one of my regular spots. Probably not going back.
__label__4	"Great Thai taste and vegetarians well catered for. Prices can creep up but I guess rent in location is not cheap. They made authentic tasting Panang and green curry with tofu however the Pad Thai was slightly dry. Lived thier thaivietnames fresh made summer rolls. 
We had a takeout though and quantity was ample. Wish they did not stinge on their rice."
__label__4	My family frequently stops here for bubble tea. Only complaint is the alvocado bubble tea lacks flavour.
__label__5	Looking for some soft and pretty summer clothes at good prices and definitely found a few items. Great store!
__label__4	Had the Italian sub; was very good.  Fresh ingredients and friendly staff.  About as good as you can get without going to a real deli.
__label__5	Fantastic Italian byob.  Good food, good atmosphere, good service, and dirt cheap!  I'm very picky and super critical of restaurants, having worked in many over the years....but I would never hesitate to go here or recommend it to others!
__label__5	WONDERFUL , everything is great from appetizers to dessert, artistically presented and tastes as good as it looks, gotta have it!!! service is fabulous as well!!
__label__1	The salad bar seriously needs work. The greens lacked freshness as expected for something that sits out in the open. When I went for some mushrooms, fruitflies came out. D: The strawberries were overly ripe and bitter. Maybe they could focus on in season fruit? Everything else was fine but...the salad bar. It is cool that they offer something green among the starch but...it needs work. Otherwise, short wait time.
__label__5	"The fresh ingredients really set this place apart from so many other restaurants. I've yet to try anything I didn't like - it's truly a culinary experience. 

The Brandon location has a beautiful, rustic vibe and feels welcoming. I love dining at the center bar even though there's never a long wait for other seating. The drinks are just as well thought-out and crafted as the dishes. Honorable mentions: Brussels sprouts and the shrimp & grits."
__label__4	"Great location and food!  Highly recommend a visit.  

According to my wife... ""the best margaritas ever!"".  El Vez guacamole was very good.  Got the taco sampler... sea bass was amazing, steak and chicken were very good and the mahi was interesting but tasty. I didn't love the carnitas taco but they were well prepared."
__label__5	Great food, unique flavors just not hot. Plates need to come out hot and stay warm for at least 15 mins. I wanted to get bananas foster one more time but the French toast bananas foster just as awesome. I had the eggs Cochon and it was so incredibly tasty - highly recommend. Been here a couple of times because the staff is warm and inviting and intend to come back again.
__label__4	I've been here twice and have had excellent service both times (once for dinner and once for lunch). I've had a salmon special and a pulled pork sandwich. The pulled pork, while not like anything I've had before, was incredibly good. Bold flavor, not too spicy. The salmon was also delicious. My only complaint is the size of the restaurant: it is SMALL. Which is fine, but I'm uncomfortable in small spaces, and you can't ignore that. But the food is delicious and the service was great if you can get past it
__label__2	Their maintaince department needs a clean out. Andrew, Steven and manager Mabel have the worst attitudes and should not be allowed to answer or deal with any customers. I would not recommend renting from this company just based on the experience I had with them.
__label__5	Great place! Very honest, affordable, and fast. This is my go-to auto shop.
__label__4	"I have been to this location many time and have always had great service. On this particular visit, I ordered their chicken mini buscuits which are extremely sweet and juicy chicken. This is better than ""fast food"" and for the price it must be. Keep eating more Chicken!"
__label__5	It deserves good review. Just like any new business could use a little faith from their clientele. Chipotle makes good fresh and somewhat healthy food and this location delivers exactly that. If you find yourself in reviewers shoes just remember that you're not in upscale joint but in quick stop lunch and go modern world luncheon. If you like chipotle you'll like this place just like any other location. Now go in and enjoy that burrritoooo!!!
__label__5	Excellent and friendly service! I smashed my mask strap buckle right before a big dive trip. Because it would have taken several days for the replacement part to arrive, the owner swapped out my broken part for a new part from a floor model and fixed it right away. He charged me only for the part, not for S&H or labor on the repair, which he did while I waited. Really came through for me!
__label__3	Service was great and the ambiance is nice that is why I'm giving this place 3 stars. The Turkey burgers are not good, lacks flavor and has a weird texture.
__label__5	Eileen was absolutely awesome. Her service and knowledge and design made our master bathroom look awesome. We highly recommend her and PA Home Store. Great prices too!
__label__5	Relaxing and great service. Everyone is really nice and the manicure and pedicure are great!
__label__5	"Wonderful place! Probably the best oysters I've tried :) love the red fish - the mushroom sauce was perfect! The Oceana grilled oysters were very delicious  
Enjoyed my chocolate martini as well!
P.s. they have delivery service"
__label__2	I am so disappointed that Subway removed roast beef from their restaurants. I went to get a Subway Club and the girl put bacon on the bread. I told her I ordered a Subway Club not bacon and she told me Subway removed all roast beef from their menus. This is outrageous! Roast beef is much healthier than bacon. I will no longer eat at Subway.
__label__2	Prices are competitive with other restaurants in the area, but quality is not. Wait staff was dismissive and my table was regularly looked passed. I had to ask explicitly for chip refills twice. Disappointed in my visit.
__label__2	Service is very poor. I've been trying to get someone to notice me trying to bring in my tire that I've brought in three times to get fixed and it's still not fixed. Also, when ordering a bike they told me they would call and nothing. I had to come in so they could remember and they gave me the poor excuse that I had given them the wrong phone number. Too bad this is the closest bike shop. Will try to avoid it.
__label__5	Wow.  Just celebrated a delicious birthday dinner tonight.  Absolutely terrific Seared Ahi and 1/2 roasted chicken with mashed potatoes.  Accompanied by dinner salads and some tasty Cinder Dry Rose!   Great meal and great service making a terrific birthday event!
__label__4	Bookbinders is a classic seafood icon and a must on your next trip to Philly. Very old school with lots of nostalgia but the seafood still measures up.  You should go...
__label__1	Attempted to eat here but the wait time was ridiculous. I arrived on time and my reservation kept getting pushed back. Please be aware when joining a waitlist because it does not reflect the actual time you will spend waiting.
__label__5	"The place is really cool looking,

I have had a good talk with the owners, really nice people.

The food is good, the fried chicken taste like it was freshly made and the fries and the sauce are really good. I really enjoy the concept, it is well located and I am sure that will be a successful business! 

I would really recommend that place if you are craving fries and fried chicken ! 

Definitely coming back if I am around the French quarter."
__label__3	This is your average hibachi place, overcooked and dry meat and floors littered with food. However if you choose to do the sit down option their sushi and noodle dishes are the best in the area.
__label__5	They do a great job with our pets. Even sent a sympathy card when we had to put our dog to sleep. Highly recommend.
__label__1	"The place LOOKS really professional but I had to walk out. I asked for something VERY simple, just a fill with an inverted V white tip. I couldn't believe it when she told me they couldn't do it. ""no airbrush"", last place did it by hand with polish I tell her ""too hard"" she says. I'm sorry, if you can't handle that as a so called professional, I'm certainly not letting you fill my nails either!"
__label__4	This is not your average New Orleans themed tshirt shop. Not at all. They've got so much more than tshirts, even the opportunity to screen print your own designs. They sell bags, clothes, glasses, magnets and other souvenirs. If you're shopping for a New Orleans themed gift, there is a good chance you'll find what you're looking for here.
__label__3	Had lunch here with my mom before I knew I had to be gluten-free... had a great burger... but the accompanying fries were very greasy and not crispy. My mom had the crab cakes which I did not try but she said they were good as well!
__label__2	We were surprised that an $11 frittata came with no sides - no toast, no potatoes, no meat.  The complimentary fruit salad for the table was nice but very small.  The food and service and atmosphere were good. If they bring the price/portion into alignment I will definitely go back.
__label__3	Mixed reviews on this one from our crew. Hubby loved, one out of four kids liked it and I was not a fan. It was hot and the chicken was moist and cooked well but the flavor of the chicken was not my favorite. As far as sides, Cole slaw was ok,fries were good, Mac n cheese was good. It was fast despite the line and it was a cute retro feel atmosphere.
__label__2	Took my car to have a small chip repaired on my front windshield...done in less than 5 minutes.  After payment, I went out to look and it doesn't look any better.  Talked to the front desk and person that worked on it...sorry that's the way it will look (like nothing has been done).  I have numerous chips done at the Walmart's parking lot and the free-lancers have done an excellent job and hardly shows the chip.  Don't waste your time and money!
__label__5	Great hoagies. I typically get the turkey with prosciutto, I don't like the cheesesteaks but you absolutely can't go wrong getting a hoagie. Everything is fresh and sliced to order.
__label__1	My daughter worked here, they are racist, they oppress some employees, they bothered that she received better tips than others. Each time the customers congratulated her they  muttered to each other . They fired her because they wanted to charge her rent for one of the instruments they all used for free, but she couldn't use it. They talk about customers who don't like them. The best way to get this kind of people out is not to visit the place.
__label__2	Salmon overcooked.  Second time only marginally better and ate alone since my friends had already finished when mine arrived the second time. Shrimp were fishy tasting. Servers were friendly enough.  Looked like the bar was popular for happy hour. For the price and mediocre good, won't be back.
__label__3	"Yes, the St. Louis Art Museum is still crazy free after all of these years.  It is a nice place to spend part of a rainy day.  The entrance hall is awe-inspiring and simply massive.  
To be fair, I have to only give SLAM three stars due to its thin depth of works.  When compared to cities of a similar scope such as Buffalo, NY, St. Louis Art Museum's regular collection just does not stack up."
__label__5	Friendly quick and professional.  I was in and out.  Clothes finished before promised. Positive experience all the way around.
__label__5	Sally has been doing my alterations and dry cleaning for several years now. Service is exceptional, prices are great, and my clothes are always well cared for. I give South Dale Cleaners and Sally's Amazing Alterations five stars!
__label__1	"It's advertised closing time is 10p. Got there at 9:15p and they said kitchen closes at 9p.

Not a good first impression."
__label__5	Best Greek restaurant around.  Very authentic!  Great service.  Great prices.  Fresh bakery!  We live in Largo, but make the drive just to come here.   Highly recommend if you're looking for the tried and true authentic Greek cuisine!
__label__5	The best bagels outside of NYC. Perfectly made with great service. Highly recommended
__label__5	We went here based on recommendation from a local and were not disappointed! Food was awesome, especially for the price point!  If you go you should request Dawn as your server - she was fantastic.  We ordered everything she told us to and I mark this one of my best dining experiences to date.  We went with the Sweetbreads and Brussel Sprouts (awesome to eat together) for the starter, then got the pork shoulder and the Pork Milanese for entrees.  This will be a mandatory stop every time we are in NOLA.
__label__5	This place was great! Went here to grab myself breakfast and lunch before a busy day. I had the veggie omlette for breakfast and I ordered the chicken cutlet sandwich for lunch. Both were really great! Employees were all attentive and really nice. I will definitely be back when I get the chance. Can't wait to try other things off the menu. This place was also really clean and looked like it had recently been renovated
__label__5	Got the bagel roll and hello yellowtail roll.. and both were delicious!!! Both were fried and I picked up my order 2 hours after placing it and even then it tasted so good!!! I can only imagine how delicious it would have been eaten fresh/ as soon as they made it.
__label__1	I come here all the time this is probably the fourth or fifth time I pay for something and they never give it to me for example my previous order they didn't give me my ice cream this order they forgot my tenders the order before and before that they always forgot something and I paid for it's money that I pay and I don't get what I paid for I don't understand why this keeps happening please find someone to fix this problem so I can enjoy my meals and not waste my money
__label__2	"I am rating the Fish and Chips. It was absolutely the worst I've had. It was a single large piece of cod that was thickly breaded in beer batter. The batter was way too thick and the piece of cod was too big that it caused the batter to be soggy upon cutting it to eat. 
Service was pretty good except our waiter apparently took a long break so others had to fill in."
__label__1	Tried to go in during free spray tan week tonight. I've done this for a few years at different locations and never had an issue. Employee (female with red hair and tattoos) tried to tell me I could only get light and then shilled a $29.95 package. Told her my friend just went to the Franklin location tonight and had no issues getting a medium shade for free with no packages pushed on her. I spray tan frequently, but I will never be back to this location. Super disappointing customer service. Please don't waste your money here.
__label__5	I love Sacred Pepper because of the food,the service and the staff. They have never let us down.
__label__4	Delicious! One of my favorite places to go. It is quite expensive, but I highly suggest loading up on the garlic nan bread. I've tried many things such as butter chicken, chicken korma, lamb korma, tiki masala, etc and loved it every single time. I do enjoy the samosas but they are a hit or miss. Sometimes it's delicious full with flavor and sometimes it's dry.
__label__1	The fish and shrimp tacos were delicious and extremely overpriced (they are TINY). The steak tacos were mediocre, expensive and tiny.  Most places in town sell large fish tacos with sides for the same price.  I only ate here that day except for a clif bar in the morning and later that evening I was throwing up for hours and felt miserable the next two days. Will never return.
__label__4	Good food. Made fresh so there is a wait, so don't go if you're in a rush . Very friendly staff and great music. Portions are huge so you will have plenty to take home. Decor is a little low key but I get the vibe it's a place where people get food to go. Overall a spot worth checking out.
__label__5	Visited here a few times now & love it every time! The mini donuts can be customized to what you like but their Boston cream mini is amazing, and the sweet pig. I encourage you to try them all its such a cute shop. Definitely will keep coming back as I crave the Boston mini frequently :) also have super cute shakes with a mini donut on the straw
__label__5	"Place rocks!!!!!!!
Its top shelf health club and pool!
Try the free demo and you will see
5 stars"
__label__5	After getting ripped off by a thieving contractor who made a mess of the drywall project Ryan, Ken and the crew came in and did a masterful job. They are professional and very talented. I can't say enough about the work that they performed. Thanks again.
__label__5	Mailee and Selena formerly of S Nails have relocated to this new location. Great new space with updated equipment and services. Beautiful salon nice employees and clients.
__label__5	"Coming from Vancouver we had a craving for Asian food while visiting Idaho. 

This place is amazing. The green curry was one of the best I've ever had. On par with the best places in Vancouver. Good service and plentiful portions. 


Would visit again absolutely. Highly recommend"
__label__5	So good!! I loved the breakfast! They were fast and our server was very good. Pastries are also amazing!  The turnovers are cheap and soooo good. Definitely recommend this place for cheap and fast delicious food.
__label__3	Great location when you're attending a performance at Fox Theater next door. If the show begins at 7:30 make your reservation for 5:30. Parking is easy on the street or in an adjacent lot. Service is *unbelievably* slow at this restaurant, so be extremely patient. Food is good. I enjoyed pasta with seafood, plus minestrone with pesto (it's white, not red). Friendly and attractive ambience with comfortable chairs and quiet acoustics for easy conversation. But remember about the glacial service.
__label__1	We have waited over 45 minutes from our appt time to be seen every time (3 separate occasions). The billing side and the staff are not coordinated. We received different charges for the same procedures at different times. I would not recommend this office.
__label__3	I really wanted to like this place after seeing the amazing reviews but can't say that I did. We ordered the iced Miss Tracy's Addiction, since that's what everyone seems to rave about, and since we don't like sweet coffee, we ordered it with half the amount of honey it typically comes with, as recommended by another reviewer. Nothing about the coffee stood out to me and it was still too sweet for our taste, even with half the honey. We were also disappointed because we wanted an iced tea, but they were completely out of all of their iced teas.
__label__5	"Fantastic LEGO birthday parties and camps!
Our son has his 11th birthday here, and had a wonderful time with his buddies!  They actually have science and art curriculum that they use to teach the kids while they are having fun.  All of the kids had a great time!  The party room was perfect, too!  Highly recommended!"
__label__1	"Just left Daily Eats....asked for the BBQ Chicken Sandwich I had on Friday, and they would not serve it.  It wasn't after 3PM???  Crazy.  It was Noon on Friday when I had it.  Time of day really shouldn't matter.....oh well, so we left.  Now we are at Panera enjoying Lunch.  I have always enjoyed my Meals at Daily Eats.  Not today, new management?  There are ways to say ""no"" but I didn't get it today."
__label__5	Adrianne the bartender is amazing! We come to Granite city for the drinks but also because she always gives top-notch service and great conversation! She has the best smile too! If you want to have a great night and great drinks go see Adrianne at Granite city!!!!!
__label__5	Absolutely amazing!! Every time I leave feeling like jelly...in a great way. Absolutely recommended. Better massage than Massage Envy for sure! Can't sing their praises enough.
__label__5	"Lord have mercy this is the most delicious food I've ever had! Ok ok maybe not the most but it's really good. 

Get the pho it's the way to go, also the Vietnamese eggrolls"
__label__4	Ordered the lobster roll. It was good but a bit bland. Needed lemon, or something else added to the mix. My friend ordered it as well and thought the same. The lobster itself was very good, and the bread they used was good. And the fried pickles, bomb! They should probably add these as an appetizer to their menu. Service was fine; we were there during the week during lunch, we didn't wait long.
__label__5	"The Calamari with a sweet and sour caramel glaze, EVERYTHING on the menu was unique.  

Please treat yourself to this diamond in the rough, I felt like I was eating at a fine restaurant in NY with extremely reasonable prices and a view that can not be beat. 

From Owner to wait staff everyone is a consummate professional, but it's also a place where everyone will know your name.  

I honestly felt like I was at Cheers!   The Food is Porn!"
__label__2	Pancakes are pretty damn good, egg dishes however, leave a lot to be desired. Seems like the skillet dishes are made with powdered eggs. The customer service is usually OK. In the future, I'd only go to TP in a pinch.
__label__3	Pretty limited menu, food was basically average hence the three star review.  Overall, simply unremarkable.
__label__5	So many organic options... yum acai bowls! Great friendly staff. Owner cares about hiring right people. One of few high quality food on this street. Rest seem more commercial.
__label__4	I like this place. Chicken curry dish was good. Good quality British pub food. Wine pour was generous. Nice bar with a few locals. Black and tans were perfect!
__label__1	Milkshake machine never works. Just go to Wendy's across the street.
__label__4	Pretty solid food for being in a library cafe. I also like that all of the coffee drinks are named after book characters. I typically get an Americano and I was happy with my purchase. The coffee drinks are tastey, but the homemade soda isn't anything special. There's always a line considering its the only place in the building where you can grab a snack.
__label__5	TRUE NY style pies!  Absolutely the BEST NY style pizza in town.  It's a great place to stop in for a quick slice or bring the entire family and put several tables together!  The folks who work there are always friendly and very helpful.  If you are dining for one, sit at the counter and watch them work their magic, it is quite fun!
__label__5	"Updating my review back to 5 stars because the service here has been amazing lately. 

Lately, the waiters who take my order here haven't messed up an order. They are very nice, friendly, and offer a relaxed dining experience."
__label__5	The cutest succulent and pot was delivered today.  The pot was beautifully hand crafted and the succulent, healthy and perfect.  Thank you Floridelphia, for making me happy!
__label__5	"A massive burrito, filled with 5 star accessories plus pleasure, guilt-free, saliva oozing goodness. Man oh man, where is Oscar? During this ""pandemic"", the man has saved the day with his affordable; yet delectable menu. Thanks again!"
__label__1	In store is great.... staff is extremely helpful.  I recommend any purchases be made in store though.  Attempted to purchase some Google home max speakers, which were on sale. Was given the impression that stock was extremely limited.  The date I was supposed to pick up however came and went.  They eventually canceled my order, again giving me the impression they weren't going to receive any more to sell.  That was more than a month ago.  Now selling those speakers at full price.... Seems a bit shady
__label__2	Just had my first lunch here.  Simple menu, which I like, and great, fresh ingredients.  The two simple tacos I ordered were actually very good but HOLLY CRAP - I spent $9.24 for two tiny tacos (I'm still hungry)!  I thought for sure they would come with rice and beans... and hopefully chips (?) for my To Go order... but no such luck.  I just got ripped off. :(
__label__5	I've been looking for a nice nail salon in Tampa for almost a year. And I finally found it! The atmosphere was clean, upscale and professional. I got a manicure (SNS with tips) and pedicure. They came out beautiful and perfect! My nail tech, Elijah was so kind, dilligent and quick! My nails came out absolutely perfect! I will be back! And I am so happy to have finally find a nail salon!
__label__2	We stopped in on Saturday afternoon for a late lunch. I remember coming here years ago for the bar scene, which wasn't bad. The food though leaves a lot to be desired. I had the dubliner burger and my wife had the shrimp kabobs. Both lacked seasoning and were uninspiring dishes. I doubt we'll try this place again for the food.
__label__5	Never been in, but gee do i love driving by that horse ya'll got out there. If you know what i mean...
__label__1	"DONT EAT HERE!! I had sushi and it made me sooooooooooo sick!!! And my co-worker ate here a week ago and it made her sick as well!! I wished I would have talked to her before I went there..I called to tell them and the lady had an attitude and was rude..I was being very nice and tell her what happened and her response was "" Look what do you want from us"".. ARE YOU SERIOUS!! I will never spent another dime here!!!!!"
__label__4	The food is very good.  Better than many other beach do called seafood restaurants in the area. They have been here 25 years for a reason. You probably need reservations. Open table worked great.
__label__1	Really no chocolate flavor.  What more can I say.  So we tried the cherry vanilla  flavor.  Below average w canned cherry.  Yikes.  Vanilla was so sugary.  Too sweat. If it's good ice cream and the ingredients are organic (@ this price point ) than it would taste better
__label__4	Good upscale Indian food. Nice, strong flavors and a great atmosphere. Will definitely visit again.
__label__5	Love this place. Everything is fresh and homemade. They have a menu you don't see anywhere and it's all good.
__label__3	Please  GM  bring  back Melanie  and  you will never  have  these  Issues  again  she was a  Wonderful  Bartender at what she  did. over the years. Never heard a  problem with that  Bartender unlike the others  that work here now
__label__2	"Eh. Not impressed. I think this place would have gone out of business years ago without the supposed ""competition"" with Gino's across the street. I'd give these guys a 2/5, Gino's a 2/5. If you want something good, try Jim's on 4th and South 5/5. There are several other 4-5 star places around other than Jim's, but don't waste your time with these ""authentic"" places. The bread is all chewy and the meat is like something you get from 7-11."
__label__4	"I'm so into this workout and the vibe at the studio. Approachable and upscale all at once with positive energy and a hard freaking workout. 

My one star off is because of the smell from Penn & Beech. It can be pretty strong during class and depending on what they are mixing there it is has triggered my allergies which obviously puts a damper on a good workout."
__label__5	Everything on the menu here is great. Service is also fantastic. Don't skip dessert. Love you, Barbuzzo!
__label__4	This review is only for the pierogies. I know, how did I not get a hot dog at a place called Franks? But, the homemade pierogie sign won me over. They are nicely salted and stuff with potato goodness. Get it with the sour cream. Yummy and quick!
__label__1	Came here for all you can eat wing night from out of town.....service was awful and so slow!  Would not recommend!!
__label__5	I've been going here since I was 14 years old and now I'm 21, the staff is so so SO nice and sweet, the prices are fair for basically an hour and half facial. Their spa beds and heated underneath and it incorporates the same remote control set up as a Tempura-pedic bed has so you're always super comfortable. They use a steamer on your face as well to get your pores open and play relaxing music. You also get a whole room to yourself for any message or facial appointment, and the owner wears a mask the whole time she's working.
__label__4	The barista at this @Starbucks location who's name is Steven was very nice and patient with me when I was attempting to use my 'Birthday Rewards' via the Starbucks app on my iPhone.  I wasn't really familiar with the app and Steven helped to familiarize me with it in addition to explaining to me the benefits of the rewards program.  Gold star for Steven!
__label__5	"I try and be sober with my judgement. I pride myself on never behaving like a foodie fanboy. 

I don't care who makes these damn tacos. And I can't believe the day has come for me to say this,

But, 

This was actually, by far, the best taco I ever had in my life. 

Yelp, please, ... make these people rich. So we will always have access to their perfectly crafted tacos."
__label__4	Probably the best McDonald's in Nashville. Stays busy enough to where the food is at least hot. I surpass other McDonald's to come to this one.
__label__5	The first breakfast I've had in Tucson Very nice service and location. The menu is better than the other one closer to downtown.
__label__2	"Food is good but if you order online for pickup they ""won't get it"" or ""notice it"". It's happened to me now more than once, make sure you pick up a phone and call your order in."
__label__5	Forgot to review from last time. Got food for my moms 90th birthday as she loves BBQ. Was not disappointed as usual. Ribs were awesome and so was the chicken everyone loved it all. Will try some different things next time. They also smoke turkeys for thanksgiving so we are keeping that in mind as well.
__label__2	"Disorganized, chaotic store.  Two interactions with employees were negative, rude. 
Savings were not significant enough to warrant the bleh experience."
__label__1	The manager on Mother's Day was extremely rude. We came in a large party to celebrate today. We had apps, drinks and dinner. My sister and I tried to order the three course dinner special, and the dessert was strawberries. My sister and I are unfortunately allergic to strawberries so we requested to our waitress to substitute. She turns and whispers into the managers ear and the manager just shakes her head no, no explanation given, didn't even turn around to our table to apologize just continued on her way. Sorry to say she lost our future service to this establishment.
__label__5	开车前往洛杉矶 路过圣巴巴拉 来到这家餐厅 真的很赞 海边美景 还有美食 真的很棒！不过要排队 推荐大家值得一试！
__label__2	"The best way to describe this place is ""just okay"". This is a place that you go to if you can't think of something better. 
The service is hit or miss. I've had great servers and weird servers. 
The food is almost boring. They need to work on seasoning. 
I've been 4 times for lunch and once for brunch. I think I'm done trying."
__label__4	"Came for lunch with coworkers- not terribly crowded at 11:30, but really blew up after that.

I got the black garlic ramen and its was absolutely delicious. I highly recommend it! I do wish there were a few more ingredients, like mushrooms or something in it, but the portion was definitely big for lunch. 

The food came pretty quickly, and we were able to get in and out in less than an hour. I appreciated that. The price was a little high for lunch in Clayton - over $15 for soup is a little high."
__label__3	I heard so many good things about this place so I decided to give it a shot. Got here before the school rush, so it didn't take long for the food. Tried the regular beef burger and grilled chicken sandwich. Enormous, so it'll be worth your money and it seemed like they used fresh ingredients and buns. I enjoyed the burgers and a random conversation with a septa worker. Waiting to be more adventurous burgers next time.
__label__5	Great price on hardwood floors, they look amazing! They did a great job and cleaned up well no mess.  Wish I had I put in new hardwood years ago!
__label__5	Very big fan of this place. I've worked from here and taken food/coffee to go. There are tons of outlets and open seats to work, but the later you come the less personal space you'll get. Come here play a game, drink some coffee and work. Just overall loving the customer service and vibes. Go to  place in Tampa.
__label__4	This place was awesome! All of the dishes are color coded to match the price! They have a large variety of sushi, noodles, salads and soups. I got the chicken noodles and the seafood soup. They were both delish, especially the seafood soup. My only complaint is that they do not have shrimp sauce (which I love with my sushi). Overall, I'd rate this place a 4.5!
__label__5	This is a wonderful place and it is not in the heart of China town.  The food was excellent.  I highly recommend this place forever to try.
__label__5	This is a cute little restuarant/gift shop/general store near the Loop.  The food is great, and you can occupy your wait time browsing through their little shop with so many cool things for the kitchen, kids stuff, cookbooks.  Pick up a pint of ice cream, spices, cheese, or whatever you need on the way out!
__label__1	This place was awful. I paid for the Groupon and an horrible job was done. When I asked for it to be fixed, she told me she couldn't and that it's just the color I picked. I was very excited about the price but very let down by the outcome and service.
__label__4	We made a 6:40 reservation and didn't get seated until 7:15. That is very frustrating, but the only thing bad about this restaurant.  The food is amazing and so are their adult cocktails. We will definitely be going back.
__label__2	"It just wasn't great. Had the beef pho and there was barely any soup to it. Asked for extra sauces and was given one sriracha extra and a plum sauce when hoison was requested. Maybe that's my fault for not checking before I left, I just saw extra sauces in the bottom of the bag. 

The noodles were cooked very well and the meat was tasty. Just the lack of soup and requested items were disappointing. I'll probably try it again before heading back to the states."
__label__4	"It's clean, friendly and spacious.  They have 25 rooms
So it isn't super busy.  Ok...it maybe a little ""dated"" or "" tired""
But it's really nice.  The restaurant was shockingly good.  
Both the restaurant and hotel price were good value."
__label__5	"If you're anything like me, you hate recommending friends to another business.  When things get messed up, your friend blames you for sending them to a lousy place.

Nevertheless, I've sent a number of coworkers to Vecchione for tires.  They are always fair and get the job done on time at the right price.  In a world that's dominated by big businesses like Wal-Mart, it's nice to know there's still a local business out there who cares about its customers.  Thanks, Vecchione!"
__label__1	I had really bad experience this morning. The lady works here is so rude and disrespectful. I'm gonna call a corporate to let them know this lady. I have never seen this type of person like her. Never coming back if she is still working here.
__label__5	Gather has become my go-to post-morning run coffee spot. The pastries are absolutely delicious (yes, this omnivore even loves the vegan scones!), and my hands-down favorite is the chai croissant muffin. But most of all, I can't say enough lovely things about the friendly & welcoming staff, Emmy in particular!
__label__5	You can never go wrong with the chicken maroosh or beef cheesesteak! Especially if you're a zabiha eater in Philly. It's hard to live in a city worshipped for their cheesesteaks when most options aren't your form of halal. This is why Saads is the perfect spot for you! Their prices are so worth it honestly. #zabiha
__label__1	"Absolutely horrible experience. She 'lost' 3 of my husbands very expensive dress shirts, and wedding shirts and continued to say that we picked them up, when he wasn't even in the same state and I had the pick up receipt right in my hand. 
To worsen the situation, my mother in law went down and was insulted, and when she continued to call the business, the owner refused to talk to her and hung up every single time. Stay away from this place, not worth the hassle. I wouldn't even give this so called 'business' one star."
__label__4	Excellent authentic and tasty mexican food. This is one of the best. Mouth watering salsas, easy on the wallet and huge portions. We had customized our food so that it was completely vegetarian and it was done perfectly. The ordering is through a window in the restaurant and we have to get the food once it is made. The place is like a V and has limited seating but moves fast since you can't stop eating once you start it!.
__label__3	Focusing on WF's pastries and cakes -- WF specializes in individual-sized treats. There's little in the way of upscale pastries or cakes for a special occasion or party. Nothing interesting or gourmet here. I just had the chocolate eclair, one of their less expensive items. It was soggy and sickeningly sweet. The chocolate frosting  lacked any strong chocolate flavor. It was a repulsive mess.
__label__4	Consistent.  If you like it or dislike it you can be confident that tomorrow you are going to have the same experience.
__label__5	Look for the sign that says BURGERS. You will see it off of Highway 60. Pull in quick and get yourself a great burger and fries and Coca-Cola products.  Great service great food great price!!!!  I have not had a real burger that is actually juicy in a long time. This is it. :)
__label__3	Went to breakfast here today. After living in the south for several years, we were excited to try this restaurant. Menu looked great, unfortunately, the food was just okay. Fried green tomatoes were a bit tough and not enough flavor. Our server recommended the bacon and spinach scramble, couldn't find any bacon. We also had the oatmeal pumpkin banana waffles and they were nothing special.
__label__2	This place used to be incredible. Lately, we can't seem to get a decent breakfast sandwich. The barely toast the bagels so we ask for double toasted which sometimes isn't even enough. I tried a bacon, egg, and cheese for the first time and I got sprinkle of bacon crumbles. Really disappointing.
__label__5	"Absolutely fabulous meal and service. Emily our server was very friendly and attentive and made excellent suggestions. My husband had the pork chop which he said was the ""best ever"". I had the ""antipasto"" which was actually a very fresh and inventive vegetable plate - lots of flavors, layers and textures. Cozy but very open space made the evening very pleasant."
__label__5	Excellent food, service and drink selection.  Waiter was professional and knew the menu well. The server assistant's were attentive and quick to help with any requests my party had. Wonderful atmosphere and you can tell the owner(s) put time and care into their business.
__label__3	"Going to a movie and like popcorn? 

Save yourself $5 and get it here for $.75 a box. It's popped fresh daily. 

The gas prices are average and the propane refills are a buck or so above average."
__label__4	"From the outside this place doesn't look very large but once you walk in you realize first impressions deceive. I ordered two super tacos  the food was made fresh to order. 

The ambiance is quaint. Everything seems really clean and neat. Definitely not your standard divey hole in the wall. This is a great spot in between errands or for a quick lunch break. 

These were some of the best super tacos I've had to date. The food tasted fresh and the green salsa was sooooo good.

I'll be back!"
__label__1	"Service was horrible. After being seated. We waited for 15 minutes for our waiter but no one came. We left disappointed. On the way out I stopped to tell the hostess of the problem and her response was ""Oh, Okay"".

This was around 10pm on a Thursday and business looked slow with only a few others customers dinning there."
__label__5	"Great place! I really enjoyed having a massage there! Staff is very professional and the place is very clean.
I will definitely come back again!"
__label__1	Many of the machines are broken, have been broken for a long time, it's not the cleanest place either
__label__4	"Generally pretty good woth some orders better than others
 Donairs are very good. Pizza maybe bit light on cheese at times. Overall pretty good"
__label__4	We had great dinner here last night. I ordered aged balsamic on ribeye, it was great! The side dishes were delicious too. The only thing I feel they can improve is their cocktail selections. Overall great dinner!
__label__5	So happy to have this place in the neighborhood! An awesome variety of homemade donuts (including vegan & paleo), awesome chill and friendly vibe, and amaaaazing coffee. The $4.50 donut + coffee combo can't be beat!
__label__5	No trip to Nashville is complete without a quick stop at Sprinkles before heading back home. I love the cupcake atm! You will be able to choose from a variety of flavors that won't disappoint. I can't wait to go back!
__label__5	They are always super nice and fast with taking care of every guest! I prefer this Starbucks over any other one, even in the city.
__label__2	When I'm in town for business, I usually order sushi from Z.Wei. Last night when I ordered sushi, it smelt fishy and not fresh. I ordered it to go this time and didn't feel like driving all the way back. I woke up with a slight stomach ache and was a little nausea all morning. I did not get food poisoning but I could tell I was not served fresh sushi. It seems like whenever I go the restaurant is empty so they probably do not have high turnover on fish. Maybe I got a bad batch idk.
__label__5	"Big Ed's Buster Burger is the best damn burger in Reno

It's a little out of the way for me to get here but whenever I get to Reno I make it a point to stop here

For breakfast, lunch or dinner this local spot has a classic roadhouse feel with homestyle food"
__label__1	Terrible service for large groups. We have been here for two hours, and still have not received our food! The beer was flat, the sushi came out cold, and the service is terrible. I would recommend against this place. Terrible management!
__label__2	Music was terrible, the seating, very bizarre and uncomfortable.  The food was just ok.  The beer selection was good. But the expense wasn't worth it.
__label__5	We had a wonderful 4 person dinner.  All meals were on point.  I had lasagne and stuffed mushrooms.  Both very good.  Good bar and service. We will return for sure.
__label__4	"The Location: It is located in Downtown Boise. Near the intersection of W Main St and S 6th S. Parking is relatively easy to find. 

The Venue: A good place to get a strong drink, and dance the night away. I came on a Thursday, but might check it out on the weekend."
__label__5	Fabulous food!  A bit expensive but they invest in the finest ingredients and it is skillfully prepared. I had the grouper piccata and it just melts in your mouth. My husband had the special; veal Oscar and it would have fed both of us!  The house wines were a cut above too. The vegetables were cooked to perfection
__label__3	This place just reminds me of another chipotle and qdoba... except not as good. The menu options are generally the same, but parts of my burrito were cold while others were hot. It was quite unappetizing.  Not really a place worth checking out.
__label__1	"This place is a fucking dump! Period. Staffing the worst in the industry. 

Poor representation of the resort and dirty outside venues and restrooms.

Dangerous parking and little staffing to answer questions. 

Very disappointing. :("
__label__1	"This place is TERRIBLE! I will never go back here again. I came in here recently and the PA was very rude and abrupt. She rushed in and spent maybe 60 seconds with me. She talked over me and rushed everything. She was very unprofessional and very uncaring, didn't explain my diagnosis, the medication she was prescribing. or anything. This place is a joke! Go elsewhere for your urgent care needs. Because what they provide here is NOT ""care""."
__label__2	"My second visit here, and there seems to be some serious nickel-and-diming going on. My pad thai portion was smaller and came without peanuts even though they were in the description (which also said ""no rice!"") They are also changing the rules on Living Social coupons..a sign when you come in says they won't be honored on Saturdays. But the staff is nice."
__label__1	I love the food a lot . Very nice. But those Chinese employees don't have manners . They lack a good customer service.other than that I enjoy the food. I don't care about customer service I just want what I want and go
__label__3	Really wanted to love this place. $18 for beef rendang (a bowl of shredded beef) without any sides to accompany it? Not even rice? Nope, that's an extra $3. Tasty, but overpriced. Mediocre service. Would rather go to Banana Leaf or Penang in Chinatown!
__label__5	Dr. Mele was referred to us by our regular vet. We have numerous ankle biters who have bad teeth. He and his staff have shown the most compassionate care we or our pets have ever seen. His fees are very affordable and even if they weren't I would still go to him due to the fact he explains everything to us and we just love the staff!!
__label__5	This place is amazing. The evaluation was so thorough and informative. This is definitely life changing!
__label__2	I came here with two of my girlfriends because we heard such great things. We ordered the seaweed salad and it was such a small portion for $6!!!!! Ridiculous. And then I ordered the branzino roll and it was delicious but all their rolls were so freaking small I was embarrassed for them. How is that okay to charge $16 dollars for a roll that I can finish eating in 3 bites?? My friend also got the ramen and it was so bland, cup ramen sadly has more flavor than that.
__label__1	"I've never bought anything from here but I never will. When I called to get information I was rudely responded to with ""We don't open until 9"" and hung up on."
__label__5	"Great Mexican food!!
All tacos; fish, steak, & chicken are amazing!
Great quality Mexican food!
Can't say enough good about this restaurant!"
__label__4	"I started going to the K Nails in North Tampa on Dale Mabry and was happy to see them open up a shop on Bay to Bay in South Tampa. Good service. Nice massage chairs and clean shop. I've never had to wait for a pedicure but it may just be the times I go in. Great prices and polish selection. 
I recommend K Nails to my friends."
__label__5	First time in philly had amazing cheesesteak from tony Luke's one Swiss and the other whiz and I think whiz is the way to go! Not much seating but wow there meet was so tender. The cheese and onions were perfectly cooked. Definitely saving this in the book..
__label__5	This is the cutest place with amazing food!! The service was great. The roasted mushroom enchiladas were delicious. The trio Salas and guacamole was out of this world! Will be back soon!
__label__5	Holy cow! They have the most amazing collection of formal and pageant gowns that are brand new, with the tags, for around $25. Beauuuutiful dresses that are from recent seasons.  Go here if you need a formal gown. Some vintage stuff, but their formal section is where it's at.
__label__1	Second visit, today was a vape meet, very dissatisfied with the management, I will not return.
__label__5	"We stopped in to see our FAVORITE bartender. Bryan is absolutely amazing! He is truly a beautiful soul! Stop in and meet this wonderful soul! Bryan makes the best drinks!!!! 
The Pu Pu Platter was delightful. He gave us great recommendations. We ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE TIKI BAR!
Side Note: The place is very clean. Bar was clean and inviting. Food and Drink presentation A++."
__label__5	"Had dinner here again tonight and the food was excellent as always! Love that we have family owned authentic Mexican food so close to home. The portions are huge I always have a snack for later.  The staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is pleasant.  We've gotten timely delivery and visited with both large and small groups and never a reason to complain. 
Try the food for yourself I'm sure you'll love it.  Let's keep this family making their fresh and delicious food in souderton for a long time!"
__label__5	There cappuccino with almond milk was one of the best I've ever had! The almond milk was decadently thick with a rich almond flavor. It was worth the extra .50. The cofffee was strong and not acidic, just how I like it. It was busy on a Saturday morning, but they still had my coffee up quickly. The service was friendly to me and my guide dog too!
__label__1	This is a joke.  The jazz band played around 45 minutes total for the 2 hour cruise.  The deck the jazz band was on was closed.  Complete waste of time and money.
__label__5	Can't say enough great things about the Oyster house. If I could give 100 stars I would! Anything in the menu is to die for.
__label__1	I wanted to like this place but it was so disappointing. We ordered the butter lettuce salad which was served with mostly wilted lettuce and barely any dressing. Next was the Funghi pizza. It arrived cold and the first piece served did not actually have any mushrooms on it, there were barely any on the pizza, and only a few red onions. Service was slow and we had to ask multiple times for things even though the restaurant was only 1/3 full on a Saturday night. There are so many better pizza places out there, I won't be back.
__label__5	Best breakfast spot in Collegeville!  Try the lump crab meat eggs Benedict with hollandaise sauce and crispy hash browns. Family run - they do a great job. Big portions but be prepared for a wait on weekend mornings.
__label__5	"This was the second time Serge came out to fix my A/C. The first time was June 2016 to install an entire system. He had the best price amongst 3 others, arrived on time and handled it quickly.

Today I had him come out to check another company's estimate for fixing the unit. They told me it would be $780 for installing a UV-C light. Serge found no need for it and got the system running for a great, low price quickly.

I sincerely recommend Serge for an honest, competent A/C mechanic."
__label__5	"This place is my go to salad restaurant. I love their Greek salad with chicken. For $10 I get a salad, chicken, pita and tziki sauce. It's very filling and satisfying. 

Everyone who works there is very friendly and seems to love their job. I haven't ever had a bad experience there. I just ate there yesterday and can't wait to go back.

I have been going for the last 5 years and am sad that they had to close the location at the Tucson Mall years ago. I hope they get to expand again soon."
__label__5	I am so happy this place exists in my neighborhood.  Family run, amazing food.  I have tried a fair share of of the sandwiches, paninis, and coffee, and loved every single one.   My favorites include the Tuscon and the Savannah.   Very friendly staff, and they will go out of your way to make sure your custom order is correct.  The seating is a bit tight, especially when it gets crowded, but that is just a testament to how good it is, and most of the time I will just take my food home with me.
__label__5	"The atmosphere is very eclectic, the decor was contemporary. The staff was excellent, very friendly well trained.  

The food was fantastic, Only comment I would make the shack wichs would be easier to eat if the bread was toasted.  The steak shack wich was massive.  I really enjoyed it.  I will go back!"
__label__5	SO FUN AND UNIQUE! Grab a beer at the corner liquor store and go down to Lava Lips, sit down at the tiki bar and start tasting!
__label__5	Everything was fresh and good! Bacon Cheeseburger was amazing! You can share the French Toast! It is not like 8 half slices! Quick and friendly service!
__label__5	These are absolutely delectable cupcakes. Seriously the best I've ever had. I am a red velvet junkie and ate two of those bad boys after I swore I'd only eat one. I challenge anyone to find a  better cupcake. And the cupcake ATM is a really cool little feature.
__label__5	"I have been going to Deli Dave's since it was Philips Deli. The food has always been consistently good and EVERYONE who works there is so friendly. I think my favorite day to go, besides the days that end in ""y"", is Friday because Dave whips up his famous shrimp salad. It makes my mouth water just typing this. If you work or eat downtown, please don't pass up the opportunity to eat at a locally, family owned deli. You won't be disappointed!"
__label__1	Made us wait 60 minutes for takeout. Gave the wrong order (chicken to vegetarians... the horror). Asked for a replacement. Provided another wrong order (with chicken!) Dissatisfied, formerly-loyal customers. What ever happened to offering a refund and expressing apologies? Get your kitchen in order, kids.
__label__4	If you are a fan of chicken strips this is the place.  Nothing else really on the menu, but the sauce is great and of course they have fries and toast too.  The service staff is very attentive and will bring your order to your table when it is ready after you order at the counter.  No less than 4 times did staff ask if I needed anything else and once you are done eating they will bus your table.
__label__1	Owner is a rude and disrespectful. Treated my father horribly. His techs are wound up tight as the owner has them on an egg timer when berates them in front of customers. Who does this guy think he is!?!? Spend you money where it will be appreciated. Stay away!
__label__1	5th place in line. Took 40min to get served. Grill cook wearing mask under his chin the whole time. Staff fighting and all so SLOW. It was a joke. We should have walked out like the other 5 parties that left. One party that left decided to order from her car. She returned later and her order was wrong. Need some leadership in that store.
__label__5	What a great evening at the Canopy. Ashley was Amazing. She was friendly Accommodating and Efficient
__label__5	"Lexi is the first person I've let touch my hair more than once since I was in middle school. I very much appreciate her patience, knowledge, honesty, and skill in cutting my curly hair. She always listens to what I want and I always leave happy. Such customer service is rare these days! 

Also, I love the convenience of being able to schedule my appointment online!"
__label__3	"The food is good and there is live music, but the genre did not seem fitting for the young demographic. Our waitress was nice and our drinks were good. Atmosphere was good. We sat downstairs. 

BUT - It was incredibly hot so we asked if the AC could be turned down. We were told that it was because the door was kept open (which seemed unnecessary). We became so uncomfortable with the heat that we decided to leave and go to another bar. 

If I were to come back, it would have to be in the winter."
__label__5	"WOW! ... all I have to say is John S Taylor Park is the definition of what a true park is. It had playgrounds, walking trils, nature, picnic tables, grass is green and most importantly the place is very very quiet.

They have some nice places to take pictures. I took my girlfirend to this place and both she and I enjoyed it. I recommend this park to anyone who either lives close to the area or is passing by. This review will self destruct in 5 seconds ... :-) ..."
__label__4	"Pretty nice hotel, going for that W Hotel chic. Only made it to V, though. 

Well appointed, comfortable  rooms. Nice bathroom with a great shower. Free wireless internet with a good desk and comfortable chair for working. 

Decent food and okay atmosphere in the bar. Best part is the local musicians who parade through playing mostly original music."
__label__4	"I liked how quiet and cozy this place was. The sushi was rolled in slightly bigger sizes which I loved and their menu had a good amount of options: bubble tea, vegetarian rolls, tempura ice cream. 
The service was friendly but the waiter had to come back to ask us a couple of things which could have been avoided if he wrote it down. It seems to be a family-owned smaller business which is always nice.

Overall, i'd come back bc of the convenience of the location and still a very good option for a little date night."
__label__5	"Great place! With the package deals this is definitely the most affordable prices you will find. 

I had a few different technicians there before having Cat as my waxer and now I always request her. She is quick, efficient and makes the whole process as painless as possible. She is easy to talk to and very funny, which makes the experience much less awkward.

I highly recommend."
__label__5	"Wonderful, amazing food and Reuben, the owner could not be a better host. Great vibe. This is my new fav place in town.
Thank you Reuben! We will be back!"
__label__5	The best fresh and quick option around. Seriously I can't believe this is a chain. They are so good.
__label__4	Good service, limited hours.  Nice selection of sandwiches and spreads.  They close when they run out of bagels I think, which makes sense.  The bagels themselves are on the bready side though.  Not a NY style bagel with that crunchy chewiness going on.  Their bagels taste more like really dense bread in a bagel shape.  They are still tasty, but you may be disappointed if you're looking for a more traditional type of bagel.
__label__2	"Save your Money. Their free crab cakes are wontons with
a schlop of cream cheese in the center and no discernible crab.
The chicken lo mein was ok except for the parallel game of ""clue"" I had to play figuring out what the meat ACTUALLY was. I lost, and I'm pretty sure lemon chicken isn't supposed to be encrusted and
dipped into sauce. Pass on this place unless your starving and  maybe even then."
__label__5	We came here around 11am ish and there were no lines. We had the fried chicken (dark meat) and it was so tender and crispy! Love the mac and cheese as well as the peas. I would definitely come back here if I'm in NOLA.
__label__5	I have come to this dinner 3 times now and each have been fantastic. I'm all about farm to table and the is place is that; specials change with season. I had the pleasure of having their seasonal peach french toast and WOW.... so flavorful paired with a refreshing fruit sweet... not at all your typical doused in sugar dinner.
__label__4	Never have eaten a meal here. I'm writing a review on the Pizookie! They are awesome and a must try. My friends and I will go here just for the Pizookie. Soft, warm, large cookie with ice cream. Can't ask for more.
__label__5	I love their food!never had a bad meal there and it looks very clean inside. Beware of delivery service because you'll wait for an hour at least. I always pick up and it's hot fresh and ready fast.
__label__2	Food was ok, but small portions, especially for the prices.  We were still quite hungry when we left.  Took my drink away before I finished it.
__label__3	"Cortado was decent. 

This is a hole in the wall coffee shop, and though I enjoy supporting small businesses,  the coffee itself was just average, and I felt that they tailor to locals rather than tourists because although they were cordial with me they were very nice and accommodating to the locals that came in and explained in great derail the roast of the day and different flavors, whereas when I asked them about their local roasts they were quick to respond and didn't  give much detail."
__label__5	We've never had a bad experience here. Go early if you don't want to wait. Lots of good pizzas, though our fave is Bar 20, with BBQ chicken, onion and cheese.  The anti-pasto salad is delicious and big enough to share.
__label__4	Awesome barbeque. Everytime I'm in the area I have to stop and get a jumbo pork sandwich!
__label__1	Sadly disappointing... Poor service, poor food, prices charged were different from what was on the menu. The staff excuse was that they have not updated their menu, so while they are still using paper tickets and have no POS system how do they know what to charge if it is not the same as the menu?
__label__5	"My first visit to the brewery and I wasn't expecting a lot. (this is tampa after all) But I tell you, our city is growing up!  This is a state of the art Brewery!  I couldn't believe it!  Such a nice venue and the beer is the best in town...well, of all beer I have had, anywhere!
Since then, I have been back many times and I refer everyone that is a beer drinker to try this place out!!"
__label__4	Always great food. Friendly and courteous staff. The reason why i gave 4 stars and not 5 is because it's a little pricey and most things are either a pasta dish, sandwich, or fried. Not great for a low carb diet
__label__5	I had no idea about this restaurant until we found it on Yelp. Gave it a try and we were amazed. I didn't know any place in the New Orleans area had this good of Mexican food.  I had shrimp fajitas and it was full of fresh shrimp and perfectly grilled vegetables. The guacamole is amazing too.
__label__3	I don't like the texture of the Acai here but that is just my personal preference, from watching them make it I know they use the same packets that other places use (pro-tip you can get it at Whole Foods) but I think the issue is that they don't blend anything else in it. I'm not sure this is just speculation. It was expensive for what it was and I had to stand there and wait for the workers to finish up a personal conversation before they acknowledged me which is always slightly annoying.
__label__1	I can't believe the positive reviews of this place. Yes, the concept is interesting but the wine always tastes like it has gone bad and the prices are absurd. It is b/t $1.50-$7 for 2 ounces of wine. 2 ounces! That is 1/4th of a glass of wine. I would advise going to the Ritz for a couple of drinks. It will cost the same a 2 rancid glasses of wine here.
__label__3	Website needs clarification. Went here on a Saturday hoping for lunch but only the brunch menu was available, which is fairly limited and doesn't contain any sandwiches. Website is not at all clear about this. The menu button shows the complete menu but doesn't make it clear that it's only the brunch menu available on weekend days. Confusing and disappointing. We had beignets, which were a bit heavy. Overall not a great experience. May try again when there's music and a full menu.
__label__5	2 visits and I'm sold on the integrity of this business and it's people.  David is as real as it gets and he inspired me to post this review and keep coming back.  Sometimes, just being human is enough to move people closer towards you.
__label__1	I have been coming here for 11 years. When I was last there in march, I asked the girl to use the razor on my feet to get off the dead skin. The owner was very rude to me and had the nerve to tell me I complain to much. Plus there manicures suck. The polish would chip after 2 weeks on my hands. I will NEVER come back here again. They don't even speak to the customers who they work on.
__label__5	Really good food and service.  I have visited several times and have always left satisfied.   The service is consistently done well.
__label__4	Good portion sizes and great flavours in this little restaurant. I had te veggie quesadilla which was extra cheesy and good ; made better with their hot sauce. It's worth trying out a new place in a neighborhood.
__label__5	"There staff is friendly and fun. I love that they have trivia and yummy nachos on their BBQ menu! 
Awesome beer selection, too!"
__label__5	Best sushi around and so friendly! Love going to Hachi! Everything is crafted with such care. Great taste and beautiful presentation! Classy and yummy!
__label__1	"Disgusting.  Pool and Spa area gross.  I agree with reviewer who got messed about on the parking. Ditto.
 A feeling of dishonesty pervades this place.  
When we tried to elevate the many issues, we were effectively ignored.  Leadership/Ownership makes all Best Westerns look bad.  Best Western take notice of this one...you need to come in and take charge. This one makes all of your others look bad (and we have stayed at them in CA and Europe so know the product).  Change ownership/management please."
__label__4	"Much better!!
Good service, good drinks, good atmosphere. The bartenders delivered tonight! Consistency & value. 
It was greatly appreciated.
We'll be back."
__label__5	Gingham's far exceeded my expectations, it's ten times better than most IHOP or Denny's I've ever been to.  The staff was friendly and cheerful, and the food was excellent, rare traits for most 24 hour restaurants.
__label__2	Very cool atmosphere in the style of an eclectic yet clean artíst. However, the items (including drip coffee) are rather expensive if you're on a bit of a budget.
__label__1	Awful food... Service was crappy and the place felt so dirty. After eating our food my hubby and I were worried we would get sick. Won't go back. Gross.
__label__3	Well, we are not really big fans of places like the Waffle House but this place did the trick.  Food was good.  Service was quick and friendly.  We actually really liked the meal.  I wanted to give 4 stars but after a look at the floor behind the counter I just could not do it.  If it was a tad cleaner it would make the experience of dining here better.
__label__2	Ouch!  Generally when you spend over $200 for a room they do not then charge you a $15 resort fee which gets you two bottles of water and a dial up speed internet connection. A 8 oz bottle of orange juice is $3.21 in the gift shop!  I can buy a gallon for that price.  This is a nice hotel but they gouge you on the prices. Bring a lot of money if you are going to stay here. Also the room is small and I have a view of the parking lot! I guess someone has to get the third rate rooms.
__label__2	My baby started since he was 4 months old. He learned a lot and became very independent.  Sadly he end up in a toddler class were he was getting hurt every other day, same with diaper rashes. After that I understood this was not the place I will trust to leave my kid every day. The management didn't like when I brought up the situation and my kid was kicked out.
__label__4	Friendly, excellent beer, comfortable taproom with local art work. This place is doing it right considering that they are relatively new. I highly recommend it. I did a tasting flight of all if their beers and there was not a bad one in in the bunch. These guys know what they are doing. I predict big things for them.
__label__5	I've had nothing but excellent experiences since I followed my stylist, Lauren, here several months ago. The space is awesome and everyone I've met has been super nice and welcoming. Lauren is great, she listens to what I want and makes suggestions...and has saved me from a total hair disaster. I can't thank her enough. I booked my upcoming appointment online which is convenient, although I've never had trouble when calling in to schedule an appointment.  Also, there is a parking lot, which makes me super happy because I hate parallel parking.
__label__5	Great restaurant! I love the atmosphere there! It is so beautiful, peaceful, and fun at the same time! The food is delicious and the service always great! Just a great hidden gem!
__label__1	Horrible doctors office. I saw Uhalde for ear pains and bad coughing, she said I needed more exercise and a healthy life... I am not being mean but she was like 200 pounds over weight and she is preaching to a 15 pounds over weight person to eat healthier? I went to urgent care the next day because how bad the pain was and was diagnosed with an ear infection in one ear and an upper respiratory infection. The office staff are all very rude and have attitude problems. This is not a doctors office it is a freaking joke where people who couldn't get hired anywhere else come to work.
__label__4	Been meaning to try it for months & thanks to a friend's Groupon, the stars aligned. Needless to say l'll be back. If I went to SLU, I'd weigh 500 lbs from visiting this place at least weekly. Great burger & AWESOME Carne Asada fries! Owner & bartender(s) were very personable. Great atmosphere all-around. I'd love to see them with a few more local tap handles, but that's a small beer-nerd gripe, & admittedly the only reason for 4/5 instead of a perfect 5/5.
__label__5	My husband I have been trying out 'new to us' local restaurants for carryout during the quarantine and Papa Fattoush did not disappoint! The portions are huge and very yummy. We got a traditional gyro, a gyro salad and hummus and we have plenty of leftovers for another meal. Their pita was A+. Go get you some!!
__label__2	Love the products. Customer service not so much... I was asked to pay for shipping of products they didn't have when I picked them up during 'Customer Appreciation' event even after explaining that I had moved out of state.
__label__2	This is not what it used to be 10 years ago. Food mediocre. Terrible service. Sloppy and dirty. I used to love it and now I never go even though it is 2 blocks from my condo
__label__5	Good food, great milkshakes!! Loved it! I will definitely be back next time I am in town!!
__label__4	Good was really good. The fried mushrooms were amazing. I recommend going on a Monday when they have half priced entrees and 2-4-1 drinks. The cava champagne was the best I hAve ever had!
__label__3	"I went here off of a recommendation from a friend with my boyfriend before we went to see a movie in Cherry Hill.  Though the food was very tasty, he had a shrimp pizza and I had the duck pizza, it was impossible to have a conversation with him over the very loud live music playing and the  strangely long tables.  

I would come back for the food, but not when there is live music playing."
__label__4	This is a pretty good chain restaurant. Came to this location while I was visiting New Orleans. The service was great and the food was even better. If you can grab a seat outside. I would definitely recommend folks to try this spot, you won't be disappointed :-)
__label__3	"The first thing I ate on my trip was at this place. I waited for my friend Tony to arrive and we were going to work out in an hour and like true boneheads we eat a giant burrito. I had al pastor. 

It's not that great and my Santa Barbara friend told me you won't find a lot of good food on Milpas. he told us this after the fact. It was alright but my burrito was dry and didn't have that much meat in it. 

Lack of meat in a burrito was unforgivable."
__label__4	Very delicious and fresh menu accompanied by great ocean real estate. This place is on Santa Claus Lane and super close to the ocean. They have a nice patio to eat at, perfect place to have lunch with clients.
__label__5	What a wonderful class! Jessie did such a nice job walking us through the holiday gnome painting. She was so enthusiastic and encouraging that I asked her if her day job was as an elementary school teacher. (It's not.) She made sure that everyone's painting turned out beautifully. I came alone and I was unsure whether it would be weird but it was so fun meeting new people and having a few drinks and trying to make art. I would highly recommend this type of activity for anyone, including people who do not consider themselves to be artistic. You will not be disappointed.
__label__5	Food was amazing. Came for the thanksgiving dinner and cannot wait to come back and try The main menu. Peeked at the regular menu while we were there and it looked fantastic. Highly recommend I give it 5+ stars
__label__2	Pretty good food . But the guy bill has a nasty ass attitude . When you add stuff later on the order he has a issue with that . Newsflash if you don't like your job just be a bum on the street.
__label__5	You will not be disappointed in this place!  Make reservations unless you have plenty of time.  It is worth the wait!  Very busy bar area and difficult to get even a seat at the bar.  Not a place to be in a rush but go relax and enjoy the food.  It is worth it!
__label__5	Great meal.  Had Thai coconut shrimp appetizer and Cobia with a Rockefeller sauce.  Great meal!  Chelsea was a wonderful waitress.
__label__3	"This place was recommended by my Son. He wanted me to have the ""AwfulAwful"", which apparently was some awesome burger. They no longer have it  however an older gentleman walked out and recommended I have the chicken pot pie. He wasn't lying!...good stuff. Wife had the T-bone steak dinner. Sizzler does better. Thin tough steak. Service was nice and fast. Dessert was rich!!"
__label__5	This is my new favorite hair salon! Chris did a phenomenal job at cutting my hair. The layers are smooth and blend in perfectly. I have had some good haircuts, but this is by far the BEST I have ever had.  I am definitely coming back here again to Chris! (Chris is very personable and friendly too!)
__label__5	"They certainly live up to their name because holy cow, that was a good meal. First trip out for a meal since covid and everyone at the table made ""oh... wow"" face while eating. Everything was great. I'm sure my arteries are composing a strongly worded note for me as we speak, but I'll gladly go back any time I'm in the mood for a big greasy delicious burger and fries... dipped in gravy."
__label__5	Shrimp and grits great. Red Cajun fish soooo good! I would definitely dine here again.
__label__5	We ordered for the 1st time and found the food to be very good. Very happy to have another take out option in Lumberton.
__label__5	Reno needs more restaurants like Bab Cafe. It's clean, hip and most importantly, delicious.
__label__4	As a health freak I leaned towards the salad option. I didn't have a high expectation at all since we were at a bar but it turned out actually pretty tasty! I got the Greek salad with grilled chicken and the Greek chicken was super flavorful and cooked perfectly. If you're trying to be healthy at Tracey's I definitely recommend it!
__label__5	"Been using them as our vet for two dogs. 
As always, they were awesome on the last visit. They have been great each and every time we've been there. Absolutely would recommend them to everyone with a pet. I can't think of anything that they could have done better. Always impressed with the service."
__label__3	"Food is very good, but over priced drinks. Charged $9.50 for single shot rum and coke (well I might add and during ""happy hour"") is ridiculous. And also was charged for one more drink than I actually had. Bar tender corrected the bill with regard to how many I had but will not be going back."
__label__2	Was hoping for more from this new place as a supplement to the restaurants in Jenkintown. It has been very disappointing. Two expensive, two small of a menu and baristas are slow and not very personal.  Interior, of shop, could've been given more attention to make the space friendly. Hopefully changes to come.
__label__1	"Ordered 2 sandwiches and fries by phone told 20 minutes. When I went I. To pay employees were sort of rude and was told not to come into store.
Place looked so dirty and I paid but should have left the food was terrible chicken cheese steak and Italian hoagie BOTH were terrible
AVOID THIS PLACE OVER PRICED DIRTY AND BAD FOOD"
__label__4	I'm not a huge fan of Italian food, but this particular Carrabba's had some of the best I've ever had. Yea for Chicken Bryan.
__label__5	Great beer and the staff is wonderful. They made great recommendations and let us sample before we chose. They gave true hospitality. Can't remember their names but we went on 12/30/20 and I know the guy and by husband had the same birth year 89. He was an awesome server/bartender!
__label__5	"The Sunday brunch menu is accommodating which offered a great selection of breakfast options and lunch options. 

Everything we ate was delicious. The pickled beats were beautiful. The bacon is very distinctive, and it is hard to come across bacon of that quality. The burger was cooked perfectly to my preferred temperature. 

The staff was very friendly. We sat at the bar and the bartender was very knowledgeable of the menu and helpful. 

I would definitely recommend brunch here. Although there aren't many tables, so I wouldn't bring a group of people here."
__label__3	I like this Amtrak station for the sole reason it's right behind the Super Dome. That's why I like the Amtrak lines because I've so many stadiums nation wide. When the train lines were designed back in the old days the had them go right to the sport stadiums. Plus most Amtrak lines have you end up right in the middle most major city downtowns. I also love the lil gift shop in this train station. I was missing a few gifts for some family & friends, this place accompanied me just fine. The architecture is so so nothing really that special but everything else was coolio.
__label__3	From lining up on the curb like a bunch of cattle, to the dryness of the sandwich there is only two words to describe this joint. Tourist trap. Got the ferdi sandwich (the highlighted beloved sandwich of choice) and it was honestly a step up from a pre made Winn Dixie sandwich. Find yourself some cheap ham and roast beef, fire up the crock pot recipe for the gravy and you'll have a better sandwich.
__label__5	Went in 4 a cappucino! Even then was a very good experience. Now i cany wait to go back for that cuban! Very friendly place. Kinda a bimmer that they close ao early but imma make due!
__label__3	I love this place for sub sandwiches. But the back of the building parking could use some improvments. So many large holes in the pavement that need to be filled/repaired. Can damage your car. Please be careful.
__label__3	Meh. It's the closest place near my office to meet a friend for a drink after work, and it has $3 wine during happy hour, so that's something. But I'm not that excited by the fact that it is loud & crowded, and their food is fairly over-priced, for what it is.
__label__1	Some of the worst service I've ever experienced.  Bartenders are inattentive to say the least.  Bar was not busy at at all and all we saw was the backs of the bartenders.   Staying at the Nopsi hotel, which is amazing, but the customer service at this bar is some of the worst I've ever experienced.
__label__5	"i used to take the cheap bus from NYC to Philadelphia a few times a year to eat up at Reading Terminal Market and spend the day at the Philadelphia Museum of Art.

Even though I was spoiled at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, I gravitated to this museum for one reason:  the Brancusi sculptures on display in Gallery 188.  The room itself is like a small chapel and the Brancusi works are presented with such reverence that they take on the aura of religious icons.  This small gallery and its special contents will always remain in my memory."
__label__1	Website says they close at 12 when they close at 11.  We had driven almost a half hour.  So so so disappointed.  Please fix the online hours if you plan on closing an hour early
__label__4	"DO NOT MESS WITH THE BARTENDERS! If you behave yourself like a good bar patron, then they will give you respect. 
Good bands roll through here, local and out of state. Great drink selection and beer selection.
Bar food is great. Just what ya need after a good game of pool, a killer band and a strong drink."
__label__5	Although its 40$ for mens haircut, it is definately worth it. I have gotten a haircut from Sachiko (she left a year ago), Miki, and Hannah. All the times i've been here I have been satisfied with the service. All the employees that work here are friendly and helpful. Definately worth the price.
__label__1	"went for a nice brunch with 4 adults and a 2 year old. We ordered 2 BLTs. A burger. And Mac and cheese.  After an hour and 45 minutes, we decided to get up and leave and get the check for $57 for 7 beers.   No offer to comp anything except a simple ""have a good day"" and no apology. Used to love this place. Food was always good, When you got it.   

Have a good day, Forest and Main"
__label__5	"They have over 700 different kind beer .you can't go wrong .the service is great too.
they  have the game most of the time. Check them out"
__label__1	"Sorry to say, this is just a tourist trap....
It looks nothing like it does on TV show!
The size of the store is probably 25'x15'.
If you want a T-shirt or a hat with their logo
then go. Just don't expect much more. Almost all the vintage items in the store(which are very few)
say NFS. Not for sale. So excited to buy some of the items that they promote on the show.
Like I said unless I wanted an item like a T-Shirt or a hat don't bother......"
__label__5	The Hazelnut croissant was phenomenal!!  Choclatety bits all through, fresh dough, perfect!  Staff was super friendly too. I got the fig and blue cheese croissant sandwich too and it was just okay but I did eat it after the hazelnut wonder so maybe my expectations were too high.
__label__5	I have been using Mcduffee for 5 years. They are family owned and the customer service is the best you can get! They are honest and take care of their clients. I will never go anywhere else!
__label__3	Came here because it was supposed to be University City's best place for cheesesteaks, hopefully there are better places than this. Our rolls were mushy and the beef was mediocre. The service was friendly enough but that doesn't make up for cheesesteaks that taste like something you would buy at a 76ers game
__label__3	lots of food options and yet no philly cheese steaks. at a loss here. That said the airport is clean and the shuttles were pretty regular. I had 30 minutes to change terminals and transfer and still found time to lounge.
__label__4	This was one of my first BYOB dining experience when Philly started on this scene.  Great husband and wife team here.  This charming BYOB serves simple but tasteful American fare.  Don't forget to save room for dessert.
__label__4	Got a really good trim here. Hair was cut by Susan (I think that was her name) she cut my hair dry and then washed it after. While she did a good job, it cost $100 which is ridiculous for just a haircut!!
__label__1	"NOT LGBTQ FRIENDLY.

At least one of the regular clerks is  downright rude and dismissive of queer folks.

Please do not confuse this place with ""Hank's Meat Market"" down the street. Those folks are sweet."
__label__4	"They're closing! 

I will really miss this place. Had such a unique set-up. Not many restaurants have a kitschy water fountain in the middle of the outdoor patio. 

Every meal I've had here has been delicious and unbelievably satisfying. This may be because I always add extra chimichurri sauce. 

I'll miss this place! With all the neat restaurants that are closing in SB, all we'll be left with are greasy spoons, sandwiches and pasta."
__label__1	"We ordered take out last night and the food was fair at best The rice was not fresh, shrimp curry had no sauce at all , just steamed veggies and over cooked shrimp , garlic eggplant was average , the sushi was good however had. a piece of plastic in the rice I called  to give feedback and they seem to tell me that's how we make the curry , and she didn't want to hear anything . Maybe it was an off night for them 
We know that there are many places to get great asian food from ,,"
__label__1	This is one of the worst places I have ever been to and gave them several chances never have bagels. Only 2 kinds. Horrible
__label__1	Hobby Lobby will sell you something irregular and then refuse to take it back. Just left there and dealt with the Assistant Manager Karla who is extremely rude! I have to say the manager was rude as well. No CUSTOMER SERVICE at all. It was even suggested that the cameras be viewed to see how the greenery looked when I purchased them. You will not see me back in your store.
__label__5	"It's no secret that Cannery Ballroom is NOT my favorite venue. I feel like the acoustics in there totally suck unless you're right up front. However, I'm pretty obsessed with it's sister venue, Mercy Lounge.

From big names to local favorites, this music venue will never disappoint. The drinks are reasonably priced, they have pool tables, Monday night rock 'n' roll trivia, the owner is a riot and the music has and IS always top notch.

If you don't totally adore this place... you crazy."
__label__5	Ahhhhh glorious food coma. The alligator was seasoned wonderfully, crab claws delish, crawfish étouffée yummy and gumbo was a family favorite! Just be sure to bring extra $ for a good tip because if the rest of the waitresses are anything like Cindy, it will be well deserved!!!!!
__label__1	When I came the first time two years ago, the food and coffee was excellent, a few months ago when the change of owner was noticed but it was still a good place to eat, now with the new administration, the place is terrible, dirty, They do not know how to make coffee, there is no staff for the tables, I will not go back, no waste your time in this place , they are not a Barista place
__label__4	Good food! Super fast! We had just a few minutes so I told the person seating us, asked if It could please be quick, and after ordering we literally got our entrees in five minutes! Loved it!
__label__5	So good! Tasted the Pan con Lechon and the Pan con Busted. Did not disappoint, but the highlight was the perfectly cooked platanos! So delicious and can't wait to come back to try more.
__label__1	This place needs new management or ownership. They don't care how long the food takes, wether it's right or how to even talk to customers. Plus the restaurant looks disgusting.
__label__4	We have eaten there several times and always had a good experience great sushi BYOB doesn't get much better for sushi in Phoenixville.
__label__5	If there's one bar you visit in New Orleans make sure it's this place. After all it's the oldest running bar in North America. Had a wonderful time and the drinks were amazing.  Make this your definite stop in NOLA.
__label__3	Came in a few days ago. The food was decent, the service was mediocre. I would come here again.
__label__5	We went here to celebrate my birthday in lieu of sushi, and I'm so glad that we did. The service was great and the food was even better. The only thing that wasn't excellent or better was the drinks. Now it's not that the drinks were bad. I just wasn't blown away like I was with the rest of the meal. The steak was perfection! The foyot sauce was so good I asked for extra. The chicken was so tender you could cut it with a fork. I will definitely be back.
__label__3	We've been here a number of times. Mostly to watch the UK games. They have two areas; one in the front with a fireplace and one in the back with a larger bar. This is a self seating place. If you're coming to watch the game, find a seat in the front room.... if you're there to party, go to the back (it turns into a club scene). The food (wings, nachos and grill salmon) were okay and the drinks are fine. Service are generally good there.
__label__4	Got the new York chicken salad... And I was immediately hooked.  Never tasted a salad so delicious.  I'm going back for that one.  I wanna try other things to
__label__5	A great way to start A Saturday!!! Mix of crafts and organic goods. Nice folks, of course and nice music.
__label__3	It was ok.  Really not the best place if there are a lot of kids that day.  The place looked fairly clean, but nothing super exciting.  Just some blow up jumping gyms.  Food and drink areas were weak as well, so I wouldn't consider it a family destination.  More like just a place for the kids for a bit.  They had free wifi, which was nice.
__label__1	Just goes to show you Phila Magazine is total bullshit.  We had a shaved fennel salad which was loaded with salt, it was hard to swallow.  If you can't make a salad, what is the rest of the food like.  We were then served a place of average scallops that were raw in the middle.  It's amazing with food like this, the restaurant was absolutely packed.
__label__2	The food is not bad although I did ask for spicy and it wasn't.  My date had ordered short rib ramen and they brought chicken ramen.  Plus we had to wait another 15 minutes for his order to arrive!  It was a disappointing experience.
__label__3	This is the best sushi place in St Louis but it's practically never open. You can't believe the hours on their site, this site, anywhere. Recommend but definitely call before you head over.
__label__4	"Have been here a few times and my favorite day is macaroon Wednesday. 

Didn't have too many issues until the last time I visited. One of the dishes was missing meat but it was addressed and taken care of which I appreciated. 

The food and dessert here are worth some of the parking issues you may have on a busy day. It's a great spot for groups and $5 mimosas make it pretty affordable for anyone. 

It's also in an area (on the Monon) where you can walk and visit other businesses."
__label__4	"We used the parking services for this hotel.

Great rates only 3.99 per day plus taxes and fees.  

The shuttle picked us up immediately in our way to airport.  It took a good 20-25 min to catch the shuttle back from the airport.  The only reason for the four stars was because of this and that on our way back the driver hoarded around everyone waiting for a tip.

Would use again."
__label__5	A great place to bring the kids and see some coll monkeys apes and all those kind of furry things please go here make a donation if you can it all goes to feeding these former circus animals etc great place
__label__3	"First and foremost- The bathrooms are cleanest bathrooms I've seen in a bar! Major points for that.
 

My food and beverage experiences at Slainte have  always been great. Awesome beer selection. Food is pretty tasty- better than your usual bar food. Staff is always friendly and welcoming and you can't beat the location. Perfect for pre/post World Cafe Live shows drinks and eats or when you have time to kill before/after catching a train."
__label__4	I'll admit I was wary of going to a place that tried to cash in on a major tv show. But it turned out to be really good. The calzones are ENORMOUS. It is like eating a small child. Defintely enough for two-three days.
__label__5	"Had a really good experience for my first visit. The servers, especially Liliana, treated me like family. And the food was delicious!! You're talking about real authentic Mexican food. My parents are from Guadalajara, Mexico so I know what's authentic from what's not. The portion size is big (for me at least, I eat small increments throughout the day) but my father does eat 3 big meals and the meal portion size was perfect for him. 

Also, their chips and salsa are the best I've ever had at any Mexican restaurant. And no wonder: everything is homemade!"
__label__5	"Had amazing haircut with Payal!
She is very knowledgeable and has great techniques.
My hair came out more healthy look with playful texture. Highly recommended!"
__label__4	A oasis right in the heart of downtown Tampa. They carry pretty much anything you would need to go to a grocery store for. Have a really good selection of craft beers which I'm a fan of. Have treats for our K9 friends which Archie is a fan of. If you need to grab a quick lunch they sell wraps and sandwichs from Cafe Hey.
__label__1	They're in a hurry to sign you into a contract, but service after the sale is horrible! You pay every month, but hard to get an appointment! If you do, it's with someone sub-par. Cant cancel without giving up the service you paid for,  but did not receive. Also, everyone you talk to is in a hurry and doesn't give a crap. Not impressed. Go somewhere else!
__label__4	"Terrific spot with dedicated chef's that are faster (and better) than anyone I've experienced in Reno.

Their products are very fresh, and the combinations will make your mouth happy.

If you get a chance to give Sushi Minato a try... do it!"
__label__1	Not recommended. The service is not that bad, but the food is horrible. I ordered breakfast platter and didn't even finish half of them.
__label__2	The server was nice and quick. The service to get a drink was horrible. And the bar was not busy. I can see why people dont come here.
__label__3	3.5/5. portions are big and the food is alright but for some reason i never feel satisfied after eating at honeygrow. there's always a lot of people here so you have to wait a while for food but the honeybar is the saving quality of this joint. it's a little overpriced but listen to me the honeybar is such a good concept and it's delicious
__label__3	We have been going to Gengiz Khan for years. They recently moved. The location is much better except the space is really loud. The food is still good but the service is slow and not as friendly as it used to be. Not sure worth coming back.
__label__5	Their customer service was excellent. They were fast and efficient. I would highly recommend this place to anybody.
__label__2	The first few times I came here were great but the last two times I came in I had the same nail technician both times and each time took forever and both the manicure and pedicure left my cuticles bleeding. Not very relaxing at all.
__label__5	Super nice bartenders, very friendly atmosphere, large beers for a good price. Highly recommended.
__label__5	The property manager, Rachel, gave us the best customer service experience possible. She went above and beyond to make sure that we were happy and accommodated. She has a very friendly staff and they're all willing to help in any way they can. We are more than pleased with what Rachel has done to help and I can't say enough nice things about her!
__label__1	An unremarkable sports bar. Passable food, lots of Tv's, so-so beer list. This is one of those places that could do much better with just the right management tweaks.
__label__1	Horrible service, the staff is rude and unprofessional, don't know what pizza tastes like, because I never got to taste, after waiting for 30 minutes for my pizza, and inquiring several times they told me that my crust broke and they need to start over. Thank you I pass
__label__5	Had the green juice and the citrus juice. Both were great made right in front of me with fresh veggies and fruit. Nice place they said they have been there four years. I hope they have many more.
__label__5	My favorite is spicy orange but every flavor of wings I've tried has been delicious. Also love the Japanese white sauce on the fried rice.
__label__4	Breakfast was great. Had 3 little pigs portion was huge. Wife had shrimp and grits and was very pleased. Service was good. Was not disappointed at all. Maybe not a must eat but very good.
__label__4	Excellent pizza.  Very smooth process ordering by phone, although they don't appear to have their own website for online ordering.  Only cash or check accepted, but I knew that upfront and they reminded me when I ordered.  Very tasty.  The crust is done just right, not too crispy and not too doughy.  The cheese blend is excellent.  The vegetable toppings tasted as if they came from a can, but overall the pizza was good.
__label__1	wish i could give 0 stars. was told they were no longer serving food at 3am when it says 24hrs. total bs.
__label__5	"Enjoyed working with Luke he came through with everything we talked about. I
t's nice to be certain that our water is of quality throughout the house."
__label__1	Now those douche bag John lundahl is trying to collect $1800 6 months after I got a no cause eviction after my mom rented the place for 30 years and died and I rented it another 5 years never late with rent and they never made any improvements in 30 years and the siding was falling off and we were getting sick from mold asbestos and millions of mice new dimensions are doubling rental prices and screwing disabled seniors on fixed income he's a really pathetic jack ass
__label__5	Ate at Rippy's last night. It was disgusting. Yelp led us to this place tonight. A vast improvement over Rippy's and I'd recommend walking the couple block off the main drag to eat here. The food was awesome.  Beers were cold.  Service was crazy fast.  The brisket was moist, smoked wings dry rubbed were perfect, ribs were huge, and more.  Our table was glad was ventured back downtown for another chance. Thank you!
__label__5	"Oh how I missed IKEA. This store and its location are wonderful. Easy access of HWY 40/64, plenty of parking, small land child care:) & excellent customer service. 

It took us approximately 2 hours from start to check out to get through the whole store which we expected. We cannot wait to go back and check out the cafeteria."
__label__4	As of late they are doing much better, huge portions and very good if you like a bit of heat in your food, I've been happy the last few times Ive been here, usually crowded,after 5
__label__4	Very tasty.  Surprisingly good and a nice decor. I orders calamari piada.  Lots of flavor. Would have preferred it grilled.  Piada really was just a huge tasty burrito and not easy to eat. I will try as a salad or open face next time.  They sampled their lobster bisque and it was amazing.
__label__2	Went to breakfast the other day and it took forever for the food order to come up. The food wasn't worth the wait as it had little flavor. Very disappointed and surprised they had positive reviews by others. Not one person in our party thought their food was good
__label__5	Pretty generous portion sizes with a large menu and well priced lunch specials. We got the lunch fajitas, queso, and a carnitas burrito. Everything was delicious and arrived to the table fast. Will definitely be returning!
__label__2	I don't know about all the fuss, bla bla bla. This place is confused, it looks like an afternoon tea place from England inside. The burger was average, sorry. Long drive for not. I will take my chain burger from Bonefish, Kobe Beef with bacon.
__label__1	"AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE!
If you happen to get a lemon appliance, buckle up for a long, long fight.  This will include days off to wait for servicemen and no follow through from store employees.  
Go to Petrillo's Appliance."
__label__5	Very good! Food is amazing, the atmosphere is romantic with super nice staff. No discrimination here all money is welcome ! Loved our meal here. The snapper was very good!
__label__4	I love their Mexican gumbo! The flavor if the soup is just fantastic, one of the best tortilla soups I've had! Their queso verde is off the chart too, but unfortunately it's limited time only. For fast Mexican food, I really do like this place and frequent it!
__label__1	I too had the same issues with Robyn. She was extremely unprofessional and rude. I just wish I had read the previous review before I invested so much money into her business.
__label__5	This has been a great experience for a tailor shop. I came in and got recommended on what to do and the service was fast and great as well. I think I found the best place for alterations. Also a cherry on top. The prices were beyond reasonable. This is what I call great value services. Also, Dina is a great person and easy to talk to. Thanks again!
__label__4	Strong drinks, good food, and a view of Bourbon Street hey this is indeed a New Orleans experience.   Even if you dont get a seat in the window the view is still nice and the staff more than helpfull.  Crab Mac and cheese oh my
__label__5	Hands-down one of the best car washes I've ever been to the staff is so sweet and nice and they do an amazing job cleaning the exterior and interior of your car. Pricing is great and totally get bang for your buck! I love their loyalty program, 10 washes get the next free. I've never left disappointed, I recommend 100%!
__label__5	My wife and myself have been coming  Acacia for 2  years, the food is always delicious,  and wonderful service,get the window wonderfully romantic, we also love the happy hour
__label__5	DJ Dylan kills it! Best DJ in New Orleans! Always plays the best music. Everyone go check him out!
__label__5	Just discovered this place in the old Souper Salad location.  AWESOME food, decor and staff.  We were all impressed and will definitely be back!
__label__5	"Nice community! Use to live here! No issues!
Washers/dryers in home and intrusion alarms."
__label__4	Dishes are big, great service and awesome salsa station! Very good selection on beers and margaritas
__label__5	I like this place. The food is good and the service is excellent. I have to admit, they seem to have toned down the spices a little bit. I don't understand it, I love the spices! Keep up the good work.
__label__5	Really good food!! Nice staff! Really nice from the inside, as a Indian this is the best food around Avon, Plainfield and Indianapolis! Everyone should give it a try!
__label__2	Lackluster, my car still had a lot of dirt on it after, and they don't have hand dryers so there are water spots all over my car. Good for a surface clean but nothing more.
__label__4	There was nothing to not like here. Excellent, diverse menu.  My wife's chicken saltimbocca was very good, my mixed grill was really excellent. Loved trying the various wines in our own made up flight. Service was excellent, friendly,  without being over the top.  We will be back and I would recommend it to friends.  I'd give it 5 stars if they provided a few more vegetables or sides with their entrees, but like I said, we'll be back to try other items on the rather diverse menu.
__label__4	Nice food, host was very nice and courteous , will visit again when in at Louis. Try the samosas they are good..
__label__2	"As a retired guy who used to be in this business. I can say the food was OK nothing mind blowing or anything. Just standard Sysco fare. Not their fault. But the seating is horrible. I am 6'2 235 and my nephew is 6'11 and 260. We had a party of 4 and were so stuff in the booth. It has these tiny house furniture pieces. All of the seating is KID SIZE so if your 4""5"" foot tall and weigh 130 lbs you should be fine. I however dont like tiny seating where you cant even move in the booth"
__label__4	The sushi is always fantastic and the rest of the menu is good too. I did not offer a 5 star because the service is hit or miss. If the owner is in the service is amazing,  when she's not you can tell the difference right away . Slower to visit your table, have to ask for things twice. I still recommend people try this place because the sushi is that good.
__label__2	If you are looking for a quiet place for dinner, this restaurant is NOT for you. The acoustics were terrible. Had to yell to talk with my table mates. The furnishings reminded me of my middle school cafeteria days. The food was passable but not note worthy. The shining spot was the service. Our waitress was very attentive and knowledgable
__label__1	"Will NEVER get our business. My wife was trying different things on our 2 yr old daughter and I snapped a pic of her with a hat on. My wife asked a salesperson if these were the only colors available as she wanted to buy one...he replied with ""you can't take pictures in the store""...so we walked out with our cash still in hand. Eff this place."
__label__5	I've had Cali cut my hair for years, she has always taken care of me and all around as a good person like I mentioned it's been ten plus years that she's cut my hair and the environment here it's clean and quiet. Ask for Cali if you want to be taken care of the right way.
__label__1	This place is disgusting!!! I would never eat here!! If it weren't for a delivery, I would have left as soon as I stepped foot inside this place smh!!
__label__4	Great Sandwiches since 1980.  Cash only. Phenominal pork chop po boy.  I get mine undressed with grilled onions. Lunch only.  Closed Sun.  Slow.
__label__5	Stopped in at this place while traveling for work on the recommendation of a coworker who had ate there while in town. I had the white bean vegan chili and it was delicious!!
__label__1	Arrived at 9:30 pm to grab a quick bite to eat and have a drink. Hostesses sent us away because the kitchen was already closed, even though their hours state the kitchen is open until 10 pm. They also turned away two other couples while I was outside.
__label__2	Restaurant is very dirty. Dead gnats and flies everywhere. Staff can't be bothered and move at a snails pace. Food was fair.
__label__5	Visited for lunch , fast service everyone was friendly food was delicious ! Will be returning . Wish I noticed the specials that were written behind were I ordered I only thought the menu that I was facing while ordering was the only selection , excited to try other things!
__label__4	I ordered the whole hog with Mac and cheese. It's pretty good, the sauce options are amazing! The pulled pork was juicy and cooked perfectly. We also tried the Big Mama's Sample which is definitely worth it. The ribs were Smokey and the best on the sampler.
__label__4	Great variety! Brighten up your life and your taste buds. Tired of the same old food? This is the place for you. Cook it yourself or they fry it for you. The sides and condiments are world class.
__label__5	Great food! A little more expensive than other places in the area, but worth the extra cash. The dining room is great for date night too
__label__5	We were passing through last night and stopped here. Great food and service. We had the lemon chicken, buffalo chicken mac and cheese, tator tots and the cheese curds. We wanted something slightly out of downtown that would be easy to park. Parking is in the back. If we pass through Nashville ever agian, we would definitely go agian!
__label__2	The place is hip and I'm sure the other meats are better than what I had.  I'm in town for a few days so of course I want a good cheesesteak, on the menu they offer their sandwiches on a salad, which I love.  So I got the cheesesteak on a salad, the meat looked like a cross between spam and dog food, and it had very little taste.  Sorry guys, the place seems cool but u can't blow something like cheesesteak meat in Philly.
__label__1	My room is filthy. From dirty pillows, to wine on the entertainment center to shoeprints and hair in the bathroom. Very disappointing.
__label__1	The shopping experience has always been ok and I have bought many dresses from here but I am appalled that they will not allow for returns on an unworn unaltered dress due to prom cancellations. I understand it is a small business but I think they could have given at least a partial refund on an item they can easily resell for full value. Very disappointed.
__label__1	They recently moved, yet this store already feels so dirty somehow. The lines are always ridiculous as well.
__label__5	We love this place! Seriously has one of the best salad bars around. The food is always great and the price is just about right, not cheap but not too much either. The baked potato is enough for two to split and it is amazing! And then to top it off, free ice cream included :)
__label__3	"A casual diner that has a lot of vegetarian and vegan options. Loved the Carrom board and ping pong table that they have set up to play till the food arrives . Played Carrom after ages so that was really nice. 
Coming to the food I really liked their soft rotis and bhindi masala . But I found the malai kofta was lacking something and paneer butter masala had a lot of red food coloring which is a big noo !!!!!"
__label__3	Not totally impressed with the service here, but as with all the other Fooderies, I really enjoy their grocery and beer offerings.
__label__4	We stopped here for a bite after visiting the Morris Arboretum.    Really good pizza and affordable.
__label__2	The pizza had a good flavor,  but the crust was burned and hard.  Not sure I would return.
__label__2	"Peel has a nice atmosphere, great food and great service at the Edwardsville location. I would definitely recommend the Proscuitto Involtini. Yum! 

I give the bad rating because of the carry-out policy. That is, they don't do carry-out. When you call and ask, you're met with a, ""Sit at the bar and order at least ONE drink, then place an order."" Really?!"
__label__2	Fried stuff on buffet was soggy.  Not a big selection to choose from, didn't even have any samosas.  Charged extra for using credit card.  Definitely won't be going back.
__label__5	Had a great lunch yesterday. Service was exceptional! Highly recommend the southern fried chicken sandwich. Next time I am trying the lamb burger.
__label__4	3.5 stars.. lunch here was pretty darn good.  I had the lunch prix fixe.  The oyster ceviche was unremarkable, but the seafood stew was really really good.  I wish I'd had gone to lunch here more often when I was working across the street from here.  I'd like to visit for dinner sometimes.
__label__5	Mahoney's is a must every time I'm on Magazine. Truly the best poboy I've ever had. Favorites are the Shrimp Remi (with grilled shrimp) and Peacemaker. And you have to get onion rings and bottomless mimosas. The service is amazing, too!
__label__5	"Haven't been here since COVID, but in the before times we would always stop by here during any NOLA trip. If for nothing else, but to watch the works roll fresh cigars. It's an amazing art and skill. 

The quality of the cigars is high, especially relative to the price, which is very reasonable. The lounge there is great. You can do online orders as well. I sent my sister's boyfriend some cigars for Christmas."
__label__5	"WOW WOW WOW.

Best poboy I have ever had--the catfish was so crispy. The sandwich was sweet and savory, and absolutely delicious. Our servers (visited twice in our four day stay in NOLA) were very friendly and gave us great recommendations.  Our food took the average time to arrive, but it was hot when it arrived to our table.

I highly recommend the catfish poboy--I have not had a poboy come close to theirs back home in California. :("
__label__3	I wanted to love this place, big fan of top chef so Jen carrol owning it added an extra allure. The chili chicken kebab was excellent, as were the shabazi fries.  The broccoli tabbouleh and dry rubbed chicken were pretty good and unfortunately the positives end there. Woof that shrimp dish was horrendous! I forget what else we got, I may have been high
__label__4	I've been to Coat Check Coffee a few times now, and I really do enjoy the atmosphere here. They have great drinks with an artistic twist and delicious snacks. I haven't had any of their coffee (since I'm not a huge coffee person), but I have had quite a few varieties of their tea, and I am also pleased with it.
__label__5	I have always been welcomed and the ladies are. Very helpful. Duncan is very nice and sociable. Wonderful Christmas open house!
__label__3	Average - It was better than a fast food burger but nothing overly special. I had your standard burger on a wheat bun, lettuce, tomato, onion and pickle. It was okay. I got the side salad and it was jammed into this tiny plastic cup and hard to eat without being able to cut it.
__label__1	The cashier ran my scratch off and stole the proceeds. Went to another store and it said it was already cashed. Even heard the noise and she said not a winner. Heading back with police now
__label__4	Wonderful empanadas.  We were here for lunch and other than the empanadas everyone ordered sandwiches. Great flavor all the way around.
__label__2	Just an average restaurant with average service.   There are a lot of better places to eat than this.  Don't go
__label__5	Great local spot in Nashville for beer, food, friendly staff & patrons, and a Covid safe live music stage. Will definitely return next time I'm in town.
__label__5	Great job providing food for people during corona virus situation...senior day on wed certain am hrs are great but this store only offers from 65& up..I am 60 and will not go shop with kids and younger people..Other stores r offering senior hrs starting at 60 so whole foods here I come but wd rather be shopping at zuppardos ..I'm sure a lot of people 60 hv to shop for there parents also who cant get to store.I love this store and us close to home keep up the good wk ...
__label__5	TPS2 is a great place to park when traveling.  Covered parking, staff is helpful and friendly and when you leave they give you a nice cold bottle of water.  If it's a busy time of year you can reserve a parking space in advance.  And you can accumulate  points for free parking with here rewards!
__label__4	"I support any place that pairs truffle oil and french fries. 

That's really all you need to know to make a decision about going to Varga Bar, but also keep in mind they have great outdoor seating, a short list of specialty cocktails and enough  on the menu to cover any food-mood you're in. 

It is good for hangin' out."
__label__4	This is everything for which one could wish in a southern restaurant.  It is welcoming and unpretentious with tables full of regulars eating expertly cooked standards.  We were here for breakfast after having eaten at Chef's Market the night before, and my daughters and I agreed that all the comparisons favored Liz's.  My only regret is that we hadn't had dinner here the night before.
__label__5	Me and Husband saw this on a YouTube channel, he  asked what we doing for your birthday. I said driving to Harvinskins. We recently got stationed in CT. The best Cheesesteak I have had!!!!!!! Its so so so so good. Great customer service the food comes to you fast and is so Hot and delicious! I had the seafood cheesesteak and to me it was the best you can ever have!!!! Handsdown the best cheesesteak!!!!!!
__label__4	Talanya's is great! Only problem is don't park across the street at the gas station parking lot. Struggling to find what towing company towed my car. Does anyone have any idea?
__label__1	"Absolutely horrible experience. Came in to purchase a pair of shoes (available at other retailers obviously). Walked directly into the shoes section and was asked to move out of that area due to some random guy taking photos on his phone of said area. 

I'd rather drive to the flagship store in NYC than take the time to drive five minutes here. The shoes can be purchased anywhere but that experience will surely affect my future visits.

This occurred at 1pm on a Wednesday. Middle of the day."
__label__3	Having just moved into Yardley, my first stop was a pizza place of course. Venezia restaurant did not disappoint. I started off with the spicy fries which are very good, and a slice of pizza. The pizza was a touch bland, but still tasty. I have been back for the fries and get pizza here from time to time. The staff is routinely friendly, and worth paying a few extra bucks for their food.
__label__5	We ordered over the phone for carry-out and specifically asked for gluten free as I am celiac and highly sensitive. The staff was very knowledgable and helpful. When we went to pick up the food, they told us they realized they mislead us regarding one of our dishes and that it did contain gluten. They were very apologetic and made us a fresh new dish. Their customer service was great, which was a cherry on top of the delicious food. We will absolutely be going back.
__label__5	My new go to shop! I took my civic in for an alignment check and an oil change and had a great experience. All of the service writers made me feel like I was in great hands and I was able to watch my car get worked on from their comfy waiting room. They even have computers in the waiting room to help kill the time! Will recommend to all my friends
__label__5	One of my new favorite spots in the neighborhood! The french fries are easily the best around and the meatballs are extremely good! The owners are really nice and I'm so excited about the outdoor seating!
__label__5	"Best prime rib. Cooked to perfection. 
Surf and turf , lobster great portion , filet cooked to  perfection. Stuffed mushrooms with crab delicious.
Service outstanding. 
Great atmosphere."
__label__5	My garage door wasn't working property so I called suburban Overhead and tom came over the next day and I must say he was very professional and efficient and friendly....Great job on the service that was provided
__label__1	My mother is sitting here crying because pain management just called to inform her that WellCare will not pay for a second pain shot for her back until 4 months have passed. They also won't pay for physical therapy. This is why we need Medicare for all! This place is greedy.
__label__3	Sunday brunch was just average. The scone was fresh baked and cut it half to share and the tea was delicious. I ordered the full English breakfast and nothing was astounding, or terrible. The eggs, bangers, and rashers could stand to be cooked longer and the toast was closer to bread. It was an interesting experience but understandable why brunch wasn't very crowded.
__label__4	Love it here. Great craft beer list and their food is really good. We had the wings first, we prefer breaded wings but they were still good. I got the stone harbor grilled chicken sandwich with fries... DELISH. It had spinach and roasted red peppers, so good. The boyfriend got the breakfast burger and fries, he was impressed. We've been there a few times during the week for dinner and drinks and on the weekends for drinks, never a bad visit. Their $1.50 slices are delicious after a few beers on a Friday night!
__label__5	There are many services offered at Facial Artistry. They take special care with every client and one feels very special. Dr. Kusman does not do more than you need regarding the fillers and botox. I wouldn't go anywhere else! I feel very confident with the procedures.
__label__4	"I love Famous DAVE's..

To be a chain restaurant they have the best BBQ... Whenever I go with more than one person we normally get the Eat for 2 combo... Its more than what you can eat in one sitting....

Their bbq is always tender and the variety of sauces are the best!!!

This location is very clean and service is awesome...."
__label__5	Delicious!  The atmosphere, the food, the service, all top notch.  This is not a cheap dining establishment however, we felt that the portions were adequate and we left feeling very full.  All the drinks a great also.  So, if you don't feel like making reservations sitting at the bar and eating is also a great option.
__label__4	"We have been here quite a few times.  Both dine in and drive-thru.  Service is fairly quick and the staff is always friendly.  There is an indoor playground.  No fancy tablets for games but it is fine for us.

One star off for the place was a bit dirty this time we visited. There were food on the floor,  a cleaning towel left on one of the tables.  They are over all very good most of the time when we visit."
__label__5	This is a gre at place. Good food.. ice cold beer and friendly staff... lots of parking and some of the best barbecue in the Bay area.
__label__4	The staff at this clean & shiny palace to Whole Foods is great!  The missing star on this review is due to the lack of a decent floral department, and the lack of prepared salads readily available on weekends.   It is certainly the best Whole Foods in Tucson, but it still falls short of those in DC & CA.
__label__4	"Good Service. Very nice people. Clean and friendly environment. 

Very social stafff."
__label__5	I personally enjoy shoppig at this Publix. It's fairly new. It's very well maintained in terms of cleanliness. Everything is spaced out adequately. The whole shopping experience is satisfactory here! Unfortunately, it's not the most convenient Publix for me to shop at.
__label__5	Cute little shop with FANTASTIC service.  They go above and beyond to ensure that your drink is prepared to your liking and are so genuine and warm.  It is a pleasure to do business here, and I am so glad that this store was able to rebuild and find a new home.  Welcome back, Dreamer's!  I hope you're here to stay and that midtown treats you right!
__label__5	The best clams and mussels EVER... $5 a dozen during happy-hour
__label__1	Forget this place. Strippers do not take their tops of in private dances. Literally the worst strip club I've ever been to.
__label__1	Poor customer service. They fail to pay attention to who arrives first and it's supposed to be first come first serve anytime you go somewhere. Will not be back.
__label__2	"The service here isn't consistent. Sometimes we get a wonderful waitress and then others awful. 

The space is dusty. The light fixtures have dust and cobwebs. That shows a lack of care and attention to the restaurant. 

The food was ok, nothing special. I don't feel like I'm getting bang for my buck. 

Sicklerville has too many food options. I recommend they go back to the drawing board to revamp their presence and performance"
__label__2	"Usually 5 stars  I was at the bar with my dad with a hearing disability whose a disabled vet and was told to ""lower my voice "" not going going back again and I'm a regular visitor ..... shame new bartender playing Spanish music was enthusiastic and awesome until that comment from another bartender we already planned our next visit to your establishment but guess not"
__label__1	Terrible automated phone service. I've called 5 times just now. Only one time did it actually transfer me to the store... Only the then have me wait for 6-8 minutes and them disconnect.
__label__4	"Normally buy my cat food here.  Even though Petsmart is right across the parking lot, Target's prices are usually lower.  (Plus I can shop for snacks!)

So I want to extend a big THANK YOU to Target for stocking Annies Gluten Free Mac & Cheese, at a GREAT price!

Hoping they'll stock some more GF products.  It'll make my shopping a heck of a lot easier!"
__label__5	J&L nails is the BEST! Super clean and friendly people. The prices are very reasonable. Jane been going there since Tony and Tiffany became owners.
__label__3	Food was just ok.  However, great TVs beer selection and even some decent cigars.  I'll be back!  Oh, the music was good too!
__label__5	Their elote is delicious and the most authentic I've had in a Mexican restaurant other than when I go to Mexico! Everything was fantastic, but if you like things with a little more taste/flavor with salsa, let the server know! Steak street tacos are the best thing other than the elote on the menu!! Go try this place out!
__label__1	If I could give no stars I would!  This place seems so clean and friendly. But we found hair and metal fragments in our food TWICE!  We called to tell them what happened and they simply brushed us off saying that the metel comes from the cleaners and bags and that things sometimes fly/crawl onto the grill!  EWWW!  They don't wash their hands or wear gloves when prepping or handling the food! Absolutely awful!  So unsanitary!
__label__1	Flew American to NOLA from SFO (through Dallas) and back again. First Class all legs.  Every plane had small, uncomfortable seats.  Not very clean, no decent snacks, no entertainment or updates.  And very expensive.
__label__5	Excellent food, great service, great prices. Latin food, subs, burgers, sandwiches, fast food, fresh squeezed orange juice, delicious desserts, great customer service.  Breakfast All Day!!! Best Latin food in the area.
__label__5	Excellent burger, you can really taste the difference in the organic meat and the fries are delicious too. I used to be on team 5 guys but no more
__label__5	Rosie's has a great breakfast. I get the pork tenderloin Benny (once a year every birthday). Love the breakfast tacos and the gluten free blueberry pancakes are better than most regular pancakes. Highly recommend. Be sure to get there early though. The locals lines up every morning.
__label__2	Trying to make something off his name! Overpriced and over spiced fast food. Place was not clean and no ice in he soft drink dispenser. Food was hot and fresh but not worth your money! 12$ for 3 chicken tenders , fries and a drink!
__label__4	DELISH but expensive. It was our first time we got six bowl with romaine salad, spice rice, herb chicken and the steak(which was $1.50 extra) I chose the parm broccli(ok) and mushrooms(super Dank) and the pesto tomato salad(also extra) and parm(also extra) with the kale dressing(AMAZING I could drink it) Despite the $30 price tag for lunch for two the blend of fresh ingredients was delicious. Definitely fresh and worth it but watch out for extras!
__label__5	Eric and Judy are absolutely wonderful. This was our first time in and it felt like visiting family! The pancakes were out of this world and huge!!! Eggs and bacon cooked perfectly, as well. It's a brentwood must! We live close and will definitely be back. Now I'm off to enjoy my food coma.
__label__2	The ambience of this place is great, and menu looked delicious, however, the food was disappointing. We decided on doing all small plates and chose the fried liver, crab croquettes, Korean chicken, smoked gulf fish dip, and upside down cornbread. All of the flavors were extremely strong and difficult to fully enjoy anything more than a bite. Would not order any of those dishes again or recommend them. I ended up feeling very nauseous afterwards. It's a pity because we really enjoyed the vibe of the restaurant.
__label__4	It's my neighborhood go to spot, especially for dinner and happy hour. They have some wonderful pizza. All the waitresses are very friendly and remember you (just like CHEERS).
__label__4	This is a great salon, run like a well oiled machine.  Customer service was great, making sure all needs were met.  Great for large groups like bridal party or birthday party. Would definitely return again.
__label__5	"I really like Rex, whether for a quick drink or for a burger and mussels.  Nice, friendly feel, good staff, good service, good food.  A charming little spot that feels like a neighborhood joint should feel--warm and welcoming.  They do sort of cater to the ""southern thing,"" but that's not why I go there.   Rex is simply an enjoyable experience!"
__label__5	BEST EGG ROLLS EVER!! I would totally make a special trip just to eat here again! Lol(:
__label__5	Love it here. It's a must stop to and from the beach. Their coffee, bagels, and SERVICE are amazing!
__label__1	The worst African food I've ever had. I ordered Jollof rice with beef. The rice was dry and in chunks as if they scrapped it from the bottom of the pan. The beef was ok but because of the rice being so poor, the dish was terrible. My wife ordered the Casava Leaf Soup and she hated it. She's East African and eats cavasa leaf and potato greens all the time from multiple places.
__label__2	I had very high expectations of my Wildflower experience, unfortunately none of my seemingly normal expectations for a fine dining restaurant were met and I was disappointed to say the very least. We were seat promptly, but it took over 10 minutes for the server to address me. One of my least favorite of Fox Restaurant Concept.
__label__5	Made a first time visit to dine in at Pure Eatery in Fishers. I had the black & blue Caesar salad (minus the blue cheese due to no dairy diet). Salad was fresh steak was good and tender. Server was efficient and friendly. She gave helpful recommendations upon requesting. They wore masks and practiced SD. The meal was served up quickly and she was always near if we needed anything. It was handy because they were open later for our late dinner. Menu is decent with good offerings and pricing is good!
__label__5	"Another great soul food spot in the hood run by the Asians . 

Excellent boiled crawfish (spicy !) 

Fried rice seemed popular. 

and the Turkey Necks are really a treat. 

This place is not expensive and alot of locals come here. A MUST !"
__label__5	Stumbled in there for the first time this afternoon. What a delightful surprise! The place is set up with a lot of cool little rooms and vignettes and there is all sorts of fun vintage and reproduction n and antiques mixed in. The lady working behind the front desk was very helpful and couldn't have been nicer. The prices were great! I will definitely go back
__label__2	Tried both vegan Cheesesteaks and they were both not very good. The meat wasn't cooked very much and overall was pretty bland. The bread was good though!‍ And, the people are always nice. It nught be good for a non-vegan sandwich, but the vegan options weren't that great.
__label__4	Most appetizers are great.  (If they have burrata as a special, get it!)  Most main courses are meh.  Plan your orders accordingly.
__label__3	This place has good deals during the holidays so I can't complain for any reason and a great place to shop!
__label__5	"Great nature park on the south side! 
Perfect place for leisurely walks and hikes with family and furry friends as well as bird watching.
Beautifully maintained and a breath of fresh air from bustling surrounding neighborhoods."
__label__4	This is the best sushi in reno. We eat a lot of sushi all over the west coast. It's hard to find anything good once you've been spoiled. But this one is the best one here in town
__label__5	Victor and Candy are ahhhhh-mazing!!! They are incredibly patient and helpful with an indecisive buyer, turnaround times are phenomenal, their prices are awesome, and Moses does beautiful work! All around incredible experience!
__label__3	We ordered a deep dish pizza, hoping for something you might see on the menu at Lou Malnatis (we're originally from Chicago). We definitely didn't get it. It was a pan pizza, more along the lines of Dominos. Not horrible, but not deep dish.
__label__4	Was in the mood for sushi on New Years Day and this was the place to go! Can't speak much for the atmosphere since it was a slow day, but the service and sushi were great. I had the house salad with ginger sauce and two of the crunchy rolls. Husband had the hot and sour soup with two raw rolls. They were all delicious!
__label__3	Someone here decided to stop carrying Sno-Caps which are my favorite movie treat. I hope they will bring them back ASAP. Until then I will be going to movies in Green Hills.
__label__2	Perhaps this establishment should've chosen a name reflective of its strengths. While a great place to relax (although it can get loud on University), and a good place for hookah, their coffee is subpar. Acrid, overflavored, and just plain meh, it seems like coffee was not given the same level of consideration as given to their other products.
__label__5	Eggs Benedict florentine. Divine. Just try it. Great place for Sunday brunch. Good quality food, great service and NO long queue on a Sunday.
__label__1	We took a group of about 10 people to the downtown location BFC and spent a lot of money to be so disappointed. For a place that is supposed to specialize in French fries and then burns the fries but still serves them anyways that is a huge problem. I could see if it was just one person but everyone's fries were burnt. What a huge wast of money!
__label__3	"Bloody Mary- check plus 
Mimosas-check plus 
Egg Toasties- check minus ( where is the cheese and substance?) 
Cheesy Grits- check (i.e, grits with a dash o' cheese, but with s&p OK) 
Home Fries- check plus 
Cool brunch spot in GH- check plus 
Service- check plus ( awesome bar tender, who makes great drinks) 
( 3.5, maybe up to 4 when we go back to try more menu items. The steak and eggs looked really good, but we were on the tapas tour at the time)."
__label__5	So glad I live close enough for them to deliver now.  This is the pizza I grew up with in NY!  I like mine thin and greasy from all the peperoni.  The meatball sliders are delicious served on garlic knots.
__label__1	Good drinks and music. Stoooooopiddd expensive food. $17 salads w/out chicken, $14 onion rings. What?!? Have a nice drink here then run away and get normal priced food.
__label__4	"Business dinner with 8. Seevice was good but not great. Still, good. 

Food was good to very good. 

Large, friendly bar. Chairs and tables for drinks outside. 

Overall, solid."
__label__5	Awesome fresh meat and it's a small place that is friendly and nice. Better deals than the grocery store.
__label__5	Ralph's is old school in a refreshing kind of way. Walk in, tell them your problem, and they scribble your name down. No upsales, no BS, fair prices. They will get you back on the road quickly. Very trustworthy.
__label__5	Best Thai food. Hands down. This place has class, style and more flavor than any 5 restaurants in Indianapolis.
__label__5	"Ordered corned beef hash, Southwest Omelet wrap and Athenian. All great :) the price is right too.. 

The order comes with  side of fruits and bread. 

Food came fast and staff were pretty nice!

Would come back again and again!"
__label__5	"What a great burger place I ordered thru doordash and it got to me in less than 30 minutes I ordered
Shake and burger burger was still hot and shake was still delicious this is probably one of my favorite burger places and yes I will be Ordering from there again in the very near future"
__label__5	Great place to hear live music!  Huge fenced in back patio with plenty of seating and amazing bartenders.
__label__5	"This place was BEAUTIFUL.  

I am gonna steal from David K.  

 Beautiful. Opulent without being tacky. Private courtyards lined with votives at night. An honor bar stocked with really nice booze and no one watching to see how much you pour in your glass. Super-friendly help.

Hotels.com had the room listed at $195.  We called the hotel direct and got it for under 140

Totally enjoyed our stay!!!  

Special thanks to our Check in agent Linda"
__label__5	I was in a car accident and Abbott responded. The crew members that transported me took great care of me. I felt in way better hands with them than I did with the fire department that arrived prior to them. They were both compassionate and competent. If I could give more stars I would!
__label__3	We came here for only one round of drinks - so all I can say is.... Great beer and a great selection.
__label__5	"Perfect lunch.

Good service.

Salads are full of fresh fantastic flavors.

The fresh Peach Pizza is brilliant.

Excellent wine and beer selections too.

Valet park and your done. Enjoy."
__label__1	"Made a reservation a week in advance - requesting outdoor seating. This reservation was confirmed again the night before the reservation (w Carla). My parents were in town visiting and I was excited to share the outdoor views with them. Once we arrived for our reservation we were denied outdoor seating and we at in the corner of the restaurant - beside the kitchen. 

Don't waste you're time with a reservation or answering your phone to take the confirmation call. You'll have a better chance showing up day of and getting a better seat than wasting for time planning ahead. 

Thumbs down customer service."
__label__1	The event was very unorganized which lead to many of the people attending get antsy and pushy. It was difficult to hear the re-enactors since there were so many people there (large crowd) and some of the re-enactors were too close together. The re-enactors were not very captivating and did not keep our attention for long during their stories. This was the Grave Matters tour and I am wondering if the other tours offered would be of better value.
__label__4	"this place is great for lunch. It's always busy but the line moves fast and its never been a problem. They make so many of the items fresh and you can tell. Even their pickles and I'm not a fan of pickles, but theirs is more of a marinated cucumber without all the pickling agents...
I wouldn't recommend this place for a business lunch or for a meeting as it can get quite loud, but if you were going with friends and family and wanted something different than subway or fast food, this is the place."
__label__4	Great for breakfast or lunch the soup is the best, its kind of hard to screw up salad. The entrees vary I like most of the pastas, and some sandwiches but some are not that great no matter how many times i order it. The desserts are average I usually make the trip to haydels if they are opened.
__label__4	"The poke was super good. They were super nice and helpful on what to select to out in the poke bowl. However, the macaroon sandwiches were freezer burnt and not good. It was a bummer to spend $12 to be disappointed at home. 

Don't let the macaroon sandwiches deter you from the poke they make! The poke is  pretty good!"
__label__4	Starwood Resorts recently picked up this property.  It used to be the Ramada Plaza Hotel (see http://www.yelp.com/biz/ramada-plaza-hotel-the-inn-on-bourbon-new-orleans-2).  My interactions with the staff have been excellent and they honored all SPG benefits, including point redemptions, flawlessly.
__label__1	I'm stunned at the good reviews for this place. The General Tso Chicken was horrible. It was dry and almost inedibly chewy. It was $8.95 and only came with rice. We also got the sweet and sour pork, so we spent $20 for subpar food. It almost makes me suspect of Yelp because I cannot see how anyone gave this place more than 3 stars!
__label__1	friend ordered 2 beers, 45 minutes later, no beers, the bartender doesn't even acknowledge him, doesn't even ask him what his order was again? He gets the order of the guy sitting next to my friend, but then once again doesn't get my friends order of 2 beers. 2 beers isn't hard to serve, you just get two bottles and open it. WOW SIMPLE.
__label__5	It is a little gem in the tampa bay area. They have everything from community pool (currently closed) to a small waterfall, volleyball courts, picnic areas and great hiking trails. Highly recommend
__label__5	Very knowledgeable and caring staff with a genuine holistic approach to animal well-being.  Great pet food offerings as well.
__label__4	"First time there and I'd def go back.  Very good pad thai - flavorful, nicely sized portion and the shrimp was fresh.  A mango smoothie was a nice finale.  

I dined early on a Thursday evening and the place was filled...unfortunately this included an immature group of douchebags sitting directly behind me screaming in my ear."
__label__4	Dwight is friendly + did a great job. He didn't mind wearing a mask and installed our smart lock on a very think door. I got the impression he's a bit overworked so give him a raise! Reception could use a little improvement but won't keep me from using the company again. Thank you!
__label__5	We just moved to the area as everything shut down, and I hadn't had a haircut in over eight weeks.  I scheduled an appointment with Aly, and some how she managed to figure out what my hair should look like, and did a great job from taking me from a mountain woman to a present day woman.  Yes, I will be going back!
__label__1	Not happy with my purchase. A bunch of flowers for $25 should not have a sad, almost dead looking rose in it. Disappointed.
__label__5	the people here helped me out super quick. they fixed my tire for a really good price and it's held up. will be going back and recommending this place to my friends
__label__5	Fresh fish. Great service. We've eaten there 3 times a week for six months and always good. Highly recommend. Maki rolls are more fish than rice. Nigiri is nice ratio of fish to rice. Chirasi bowl is great.
__label__4	"A new gem for me
Recently moved to area and was looking for a family style place 
Nice menu atmosphere and staff
Typical Italian menu and many choices
It will be a new go to place"
__label__5	I started taking my car here on the recommendation of someone else.  I've had 3 different vehicles in here over the past few years and I feel they have all been worked on quickly and professionally. I've never felt like I am being ripped off here.  The staff is consistently friendly and helpful and have accommodated me with last minute oil changes and even patching a tire right when they were closing.
__label__3	"Food ok they have a lot of specials check their website because I don't remember but I like it good pizza 
like the beer I'm not a big fan of beers but I like it. Yes I will recommend  to any one that wants a friendly time"
__label__4	Good food. Good service. Lots of room for groups.  The majority of the wait staff were nice looking women. Great bartender.
__label__2	Sorry to see this place has gone down hill on quality of food. Used to frequent here then moved out of state for a bit, moved back and made a couple visits and was extremely disappointed with the food. Service and atmosphere is still great but the food was very meh especially for the price.
__label__3	I usually love, love, love El Charro. This time was not pleased with service. We went to the one on N Kolb Rd, where the waiters have other things to do than wait on their guests! Apparently the game was good that night because that's what they did frequently during our meal, rather than checking in when we needed them.
__label__3	This lovely establishment impressed me greatly with their Covid safety measures in place. I felt safe and was happy to give my business to people who take the pandemic seriously!! Food was good, just not quite the best sushi I've had in my life. There is ample indoor and outdoor seating alike. The restaurant is down the street from a sewage plant, so it did not smell fantastic while sitting outside. This was my first time eating out since the pandemic began and I was definitely pleased with my experience. I left full and happy! Thanks so much!
__label__1	The police called me and frankly thought that I had overpaid. Thanks for a great Valentine's Day. Hopefully your operation will improve.
__label__4	Two word review. Taco Tuesday. Drink specials. Cool atmosphere. Weird atmosphere. Shots beers. Open minds. Inclusive environment. Rock Music. Loud music. Go karts. Hangover next.
__label__5	AMAZING!!! I went here on a whim and have been coming back for a year now! This place is affordably priced and the quality is always consistent and superb!!!!!
__label__4	The owner, Francisco, and family are  friendly and make you feel right at home.  Enjoyed the Pupusas.  Reasonable prices.  Looking forward to trying other items on the menu.
__label__5	Amazing pizza, wings and beer!!! Great service and they accommodated our party of 14! If your in the area stop by!
__label__1	This restaurant has good food in the worst service I've ever seen. Don't order your food online unless you want to wait two hours for it when there's nobody even in the restaurant. I can understand having to wait for an order if it's at peak times you shouldn't have to wait over an hour for an order not at peak time. I will drive down to Bangkok sushi which is about 40 minutes round-trip before I drive literally five minutes away to go to this place again.
__label__3	Just an old tired run down gaming bar.  Probably been the same inside for 25 years with no change or keeping up with the times. Times to sell or close. Major renovation needed. Food bar food. Probably stay open from gamers that have been going there for years. Can't compete with the new stuff.
__label__1	Went there this am around 8:15 am .. was ready to buy a $200 BMW battery and was pretty much ignored as a customer.. lady just kept ordering her parts.. you could hear other workers in back not called up front to help the customers - another guy was attempting to exchange wipers.. after waiting for well over 10 minutes I walked out.. I was a SPEEDPERKS customer.. they have lost me forever- I am going to Oreilly or Auto one from now on.. This store is horrible now that the old manager Eric is no longer there - STAY AWAY
__label__4	Partner and I enjoyed breakfast here on our way to Long Beach Island. Delicious food and great service. We would certainly eat here again when in the vicinity.
__label__4	Good wings, and the prices weren't too bad. I would always get mild and lemon pepper. Personally, I like the wings at Wing Factory better than those at Wing Stop. Pretty good atmosphere, so all-in-all it rates a 4 from me.
__label__2	Was expecting a foodgasm after my first bite of the Paesano.  What a let down.  If I come back I will go for the Liverace.
__label__5	This review is based on one visit.  But one visit was enough.  This is the best ice cream I have ever experienced.  I had a simple scoop of vanilla on a sugar cone.  It was rich and delicious.  The best vanilla ice cream around.  My friends got a Stock Market Crunch and the Franklin Mint.  The Franklin Mint was my favorite, but both were excellent.  The space is small (long and narrow), so you are in for long waits and limited seating on busy days.  I would recommend anyone visiting Philadelphia to stop by and have a scoop.
__label__1	"Everyone talked about this place...so I was extreme disappointed that they closed @12 today. We
Drove 45 minutes to get turned away. It says they were open until 5pm online ."
__label__3	So, the store has lots of chocolates, but I was upset they dont actually make any of them in house - they get some locally (newtown) and some are international, but not local.  There were some great flavor combos, but the first that I have tried, a fig balsamic truffle, was nothing special.  Here's to hoping the tiramisu, irish cream, rum truffles are better!  The pistachio paste dark chocolate is great, as was the rum truffle! super rummy!  So my hopes are looking up!
__label__4	The first Thai place I ever tried in Indianapolis. For that it's got a semi-special place in my heart. That being said the food is also semi-delicious and the servers semi-attentive. The big bonus is their speedy cooks that can feed a lunch party in less than an hour. Reasonably priced, Sawasdee will continue to be on my list of decent Indianapolis Thai restaurants.
__label__2	"Please stock quality product at the Lancaster store. First you couldn't get dry leaf, not can you get grass roots products there. I can't purchase the capsules of grass roots 50 mg. Unless I drive to any other dispensary. Please start stocking quality products in this dispensary. 
The excuse of ""limited supply"" doesn't seem to affect any other dispensary but yours."
__label__5	Great new spot.  Wonderful food, drinks, service and atmosphere.  If you haven't tried it yet, you should.  You'll be very glad you did!
__label__2	"Nice selection, but one of the employees offended me! When checking out I asked if they had a military discount, and the lady with a heavy Russian accent responded ""No why should we!? If we gave them that we'd give everyone that."" Don't get me wrong, I still shop at places that don't give military discounts, but to be so rude about it is not okay! After all, these brave men and women protect your rights to say ignorant things like that, maybe work on your respect?"
__label__1	"Pretty shitty customer service. I walked in and said I'm waiting until the rest of my party checks in. I was waiting in the lobby for 15 minutes.  At least, 3 employees walked past asking about me checking in. 

Maybe 2 minutes later, someone says there's a 30 minute rule about waiting in the lobby. That is full of shit."
__label__5	Kind of a hidden gem and a lovely space to have a corporate party. The interior was cozy and the staff was nice, plus it's located at the heart of Broad Ripple. Easily fits 60-80 people.
__label__4	"Had a great lunch here. My fried Po Boy was extremely good (first one I've have in New Orleans). My sazerac was strong. Not sure if it was done right since I've never had the one.

The star of the show was the grilled oysters (with garlic and herbs). I should have ordered a couple dozen of these. They were fantastic. 

The service was pretty solid also."
__label__5	Rina is great - she came to meet me on her day off when I mis-read her hours and needed a pair of jeans for a trip I was taking. This alone is worth 5 stars, but her work is very good as well. Will definitely bring any future alterations to Rina!
__label__1	It says right here on Yelp open till 10 PM took my kids to get ice cream there after school for a special treat on Valentine's Day drove all the way from Waterloo and they refused to serve ice cream my kids were very confused I asked if they were open And I was told yes but they we're just too busy today to serve anything but strawberries SERIOUSLY My four children are so upset and crying and thought we were going to get ice cream no way to run a business!
__label__5	Love love love. The tacos and tostadas are always so tasty & fresh. Seems like they stop delivery around 10/10:30pm on the weekend, which is a bummer 'cause this is always my late-night craving. Even the basic things like rice and refried beans are delicious here.
__label__4	We were only here for drinks last night, but what a jewel box. The vibe is cozy and chic and the bartenders and staff couldn't be nicer. The renovations are beautiful.
__label__5	This restaurant is the hidden gem of Tarpon Springs. The flavor combinations are nothing like I have ever tasted and the owner is very lively and friendly. The food did take a while to come out, granted it is a one-man stand and We were a party of eight, but once I took my first bite, it was well worth it! Spectacular food, good service, and very affordable!!!
__label__4	"I've eaten Shrimp po' boy's at a number of places in New Orleans but this place has the best ones. ASK TO HOLD THE MAYO or get the mayo on the site unless you love it. Otherwise, you're in for a face full or mayonnaise. 

Also, their fried chicken wings are greasy and tasty. You will gain weight from eating here, but you're in NO so it's bound to happen anyway."
__label__3	I live down the block and decided to try this restaurant out for brunch one day.  Food was delicious and they give you a ton of it!  Had the lemon ricotta pancakes and they were very fluffy and light.  It came with a side of strawberries with whipped cream and honey.  We had also tried the yogurt with homemade granola.  The granola was amazing!
__label__5	"Called them on 12/16/2017
Due to the forest fire they evacuated the Alpacas and will not be in operation this week.

Please avoid going until everything is back to normal"
__label__1	Three of us had Breakfast at Michaels yesterday and the results were underwhelming. The service was poor as the waitress did not bring requested items such as hot sauce or coffee on time. All of our food was cold. The cream chipped beef was especially poor because the cream part of it was congealed. I will not go back there again and I do not recommend this restaurant to anybody
__label__4	Same menu you're used to, only the food isn't greasy.  It's cooked to order, and fast.  As previous posts have stated, their english isn't the best, but that's what I'd expect at an authentic Chinese American fast food spot.  Hot and Sour Soup is on point.
__label__3	This is an average Korean restaurant. Dumplings and seafood pancakes are good. Bimbimbop is above average. Ox tail soup and ox knee soup are ok, a little bit oily. The side dishes taste good. Service was average.
__label__4	"First off... I have to shout my daughter out because she has me hooked on Panda Express!!
I've visited this specific location quite a few times and they're always a bit busy... which is a good thing!!
The service is average but that's probably because they're always busy.
The food was good. I also LOVE the honey walnut shrimp!! It's my fav. But thank you Panda Express!!"
__label__1	The service was trash! The waitress barely checked in on our table. When we asked the manager about our waitress, Cat, we were told she had been assigned to another section and that's why she hadn't checked in on us. However, no one informed us of this nor did anyone check on us. I also asked multiple people for my check repeatedly for almost an hour before I received it. The manager simply said that she got busy...I won't be returning.
__label__5	Green Tea smoothies and cute puppy with slimy dinosaur toy = Happy Karla mornings. =]
__label__5	The food was delicious. You could really taste how fresh the food was. Menu has lots of variety, even a healthy section.
__label__4	Love there gelato best I've had in a long time buffet also really great selection.won't get rich here but great place to hang your hat for a couple days friendly people and nice atmosphere makez it a nice time all around.
__label__5	Great Korean food for the North side. Food is good and well prepared. Wait staff are friendly and always love to play with our kids and help keep them occupied. Dolsot Bibimbap is my favorite. Also, try their specials when they have them, they're usually excellent fusion dishes.
__label__2	My wife and I ate sushi here and it was ok, then when we got home both of our stomachs weren't feeling right. We will not be coming back here. When it was Peony's the sushi and Chinese food were great. It's a shame it went downhill.
__label__5	Went here for the first time Wednesday evening with my two sons. Ordered a rice platter while they had the drunken noodle special and pad thai. The food here is amazing! So flavorful and filling. Also tried bubble tea and loved it. The restaurant is a bit small but there are take out and delivery options. The workers are so very kind. This place exceeded my expectations. Definitely will try the pho next time!
__label__3	"A friend recommended this place- it seems very authentic.

The sushi + steamed rockfish were amazing. But the sushi is only 3 pieces. 

Everything else was underwhelming and the biggest issue I had is that the only option on the menu is a fixed menu that is $100 per person. It's pretty expensive for the experience you get."
__label__5	If you want the best facial in Philadelphia book Anastasiya. I've never had such a deep cleaning facial in all my life!!!! I give her an A++++
__label__5	Love coming here! The entire staff is amazing.  Everyone is friendly and kind. They always answer all my questions and put me at ease. I have difficult skin and Melissa and Nichoal have been amazing at helping me to figure out the best treatments for me skin type. Love the photofractional treatment. My skin is looking great! Thank you ladies!
__label__5	"We had a problem with a competitor today with a delivery order. They ran out of ribs and cancelled our delivery. So we had to scramble to get our dinner for our mothers day crowd. We called
Mission and they were more than helpful. The food is great. Thank you."
__label__1	Called JR's and requested a tow for my vehicle. After giving them all my information and location of my unlocked vehicle, with the keys in the front seat, they agreed to tow my vehicle. I was told a driver would contact me in roughly 10 minutes... waited a 1/2 hour and hadn't heard anything. Called JR's back and they declined the call twice. Very unprofessional and wouldn't recommend this business nor trust their word.
__label__4	Interestingly large portion sizes, and a staple of IV nights. I would honestly probably like going here more if not for the fact that finishing an entire order of nachos makes you a legend. Also, I heard they used to be 24 hours?
__label__5	Went here for lunch and the line was already out the door! Staff was super friendly though and got us a seat at the bar. We got the bbq nachos and the ribs. The pulled pork in the nachos were very flavorful and the dry rub on the ribs was about as good as can be. Fell right off the bone. We also tried the Kool Aid pickles which were very different, but good! Highly recommend!
__label__5	Visited this restaurant while I was in Florida for a few days. The food is great and I love the hummus, very generous portions! The place can get very busy but it's well worth the wait.
__label__1	"Horrible.  My thought--Total SCAM!  They never respond to your claim, call you back, address your problems, etc.  I called them 18 times for a leak, and they didn't even have a single contractor/plumber call me back.  Lame excuses after lame excuses.  Impossible to get hold of a manager or anyone who can make a decision.  Never experienced such thing with a warranty company.  I just checked their rating with BBB.  They have ""F"", and it says Sensible has some government issues.  Stay away!!!I"
__label__4	"What an awesome spot! Lunch vendors and other food, several bars, and lots of little treasures. 

We chose a bloody mary (awesome) and a flaming monkey (VERY strong!) and started walking around in search of something different. Unfortunately, this is what ""flea markets"" have become - mostly junk with repetitive shops and nothing antique about it. Nonetheless, it's a unique shopping experience and a fun spot to check out!"
__label__1	Parents had new patio doors installed about a month ago and they haven't finished not do they call her back. She's calling everyday for 3 weeks. DO NOT CALL THEM. Any positive post is probably from employees or friends of the owner. These guys are scam artists
__label__3	"It is what is expected. Loud, noisey, people running around wanting food and lots of it.
Waitress srvice was fine, drinks were always filled up and plates cleared away quickly. The food was ok. Was not expecting a gourmet meal and I left full. The price is awesome."
__label__5	The cheese breadsticks were really good but you should get the garlic butter and brush it on them. It makes them way better. The pizza is very tasty too.
__label__1	"This place is a dump. Their nachos are horrible and the staff are all high school dropouts. I went in and paid 7 dollars for a warm IPA. It's right next to ""black lobster"" and the crowds from there migrate over when it closes. Avoid this crap hole."
__label__1	"So annoying !!! 
HOURS HAVE CHANGE and HAve not been updated on website / online !!! 
So call before coming ! 
Also seniors have special hours and times to come in 
By appointment/ over the age of 60 ."
__label__5	I will definitely be returning, we walked in and were greeted right away by mama Dawn and she was such a sweet heart. It was our first time here so she gave us a run down about the menu and what were there favorites. We started off with onion rings and cheese fries and it was delicious. We then each got our own burgers and we finished off with three different slices of pie and they were to die for. Our server Austin and he was amazing. High energy and great service
__label__4	"I'm a big fan of the barbacoa here! Also, their lime chips rock! I like that there's a 'fast food' type joint that pledges to be environmentally friendly using humane meat. There's a lot to love about Chipotle....but what would make it five stars for is having queso. All of your competitors have it....WHY DONT YOU??! I WANT CHEESE PLEASE!

Otherwise, Chipotle is great."
__label__4	Service was quick! Got done in less than one hour. Cleaned parts of my car, filled up random liquids and put air in my tire with my paid oil change! Plus a discount from checking in with yelp! Sweet deal.
__label__5	Read several Yelp reviews and thought we'd give it a try. A-may-zing ! Really liked the concept of the sample board. Hubs and I split an oyster po boy and a bowl of chicken and sausage gumbo. Totally enough for us both. Couldn't resist trying a beignet... great little local hole in the wall place.
__label__5	I enjoy this hooters and the outside patio, the staff are always super nice too! I've mentioned before, wish the wings were still big like they used to be. Also, maybe drain the grease just a tad before bringing the wings over to the tables. Best Buffalo shrimp! Also enjoy the boneless over bone in nowadays. If you don't go here often, get medium, mild is like basically tasteless.
__label__2	When it was Paganos, this was the gold standard of food shops in the area, with the highest quality ingredients and best sandwiches you could buy.  Unfortunately, the new owner is slowly replacing the high quality ingredients with cheaper alternatives and hoping nobody notices.  Well we notice.  It's sad to see a place that I liked so much for so long be destroyed for an extra profit.  I wouldn't be surprised if they are out of business within a few years.
__label__5	I've had this on the west coast, but this is the first time I've had it in my local town (thanks to delivery options now).  And it is still good and well made here too.  Hummus + feta is a good pita.
__label__1	"Only rent here if you're a fan of living with criminals fighting in from t of your apartment, and when you complain three things happen:
1. You are told they are too busy to hear your complaints
2. They tell the criminals what you said.
3.  Then the criminals have someone pull into their spot, back into your car, then drive away (4 witnesses and plate caught).

Even the police said ""maybe it's time to move to another complex""

The pipes are deteriorating, leaving black metallic debris in the water; trash EVERYWHERE."
__label__5	I have ordered take out twice during the COVID-19 pandemic and I am amazed at how the spaghetti stays warm during transit to our home 5 minutes away. We like the blue cheese dressing on our salads and it has chunks of cheese in the dressing. I miss being there in person, but will continue to order take out for now.
__label__3	Took my daughter here to get her eyebrows waxed for the first time. The lady that greeted us was friendly and courteous. She also happened to be the one that did the waxing. She was careful and spoke about what she was doing the entire time. She knew my kid was apprehensive since she was a newbie. She did a nice job. It's a busy spot. And everyone seemed nice.
__label__4	Outstanding food and ambiance. The skate and scallops were amazing. The holiday pudding was divine. Service was good.
__label__2	Charged $20 for a shot of middle of the road bourbon.  Ridiculous mark up on liquor.  This place must cater to someone but that someone isn't me.
__label__4	We went here as a group event with the Terre Haute German Oberlandler club.  We are the bowling group. We had a great time.  Best score 61 of the nine of us.  Hit or miss, this was fun.  I personally learned to bowl using duck pins in the 60s in Maryland.  Loved it then, loved today!  Already talk of a return road trip.  Lots of others there too. Thanks
__label__5	Wife had a great experience! Clean and easy going atmosphere. Very knowledgeable and not pushy.
__label__4	Great cafe with a home cook meal feel. Owner was extremely nice and personable when describing the food and preperation. You could tell his passion for service and food. The breakfast was great, i had the corn beef hash and eggs and wasnt disappointed. Great spot and hope to be back.
__label__1	Just left this place at 11:20am 9/7/13. Parking lot empty. Seated and server never came over after waiting 10 minutes. Only saw one server. Minimal breakfast menu. Will not go back. Outside is not well kept up either.
__label__3	A bit expensive, nice place to have a desert. Lots of varieties to try. They aren't good for a take out and avoid it if you cannot get parking.
__label__4	"This is an especially awesome PJ's if you are a student or staff because you can use the computers, print, and just hang out. It has a good amount to ambient noise, but not so loud you can't think. Many just come and go, or put headphones on. Lots of plugs for your electronics. Wifi signal is strong, but only available to Tulane students and staff.

And because this is on Tulane's campus, they got their power back quickly after Hurricane Isaac. -- Something to keep in mind the next time you need a place to squat after a blackout."
__label__5	This place has the best crawfish PoBoys I've ever had! The pricing is incredibly reasonable. The hot sausage was delicious as well! The onion rings are pretty good. The sweet potato fries were average' you must go try the PoBoys here!!!
__label__5	Great service great food!! Jambalaya was amazing and having oysters shucked for me in between bites of jambalaya was so good. Loved the NOLA brown ale on tap! Definitely would come again
__label__4	Food was delicious. Salsas not so much. Authentic Mexican food? Not at all. Just fancy tacos... and fancy names. But they were really good! Just was hoping for authentic Mexican food!
__label__4	Really good breakfast fare, omelets and cinnamon rolls. The portion are big enough to share. The Colassal cinnamon roll can feed 6-8.
__label__5	"I was in town for a conference and needed an underarm wax to be ready for a Gala the same evening. The clever name made me choose them. 
We had great interactions on the phone, and when I finally got there, I was beyond pleased by the diversity of the staff, which is very important to me. Christina the 2 swipe hair removal Queen had me out of there in less than 10 minutes.
Great and diverse staff, great service whose stars are well deserved!"
__label__4	"Service was attentive. Water was the worst I've had. 
I had filet. It was cooked as requested but had no flavor. The vegetables were really good. The potstickers were decent. I'd rather eat at golden dragon in carson city."
__label__4	This is one of my favorite places to eat. Always good service and the food is excellent.  I highly recommend cracker barrel.
__label__5	I took my car here on the recommendation of a friend, and I'm so glad I did. It was making a loud rattling/bumping noise. The first try didn't work, but they didn't charge me as they weren't sure if it would. I took it back and Dave fixed it, again AT NO CHARGE because it was such a quick fix. Super nice, super honest, super competent.
__label__1	"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. Don't waste your money here. RUDE is an understatement. From the moment you walk up they are complete jerks. Got my order wrong and told me they wouldn't fix it. Cash only so there's nothing you can do. 
Seriously I've never been treated so horribly by somewhere I'm spending money in my whole life."
__label__5	I highly recommend Gail Kotel's Pilates classes, which I've taken and miss (I've yet to experience as gifted a teacher as Gail in mat Pilates). As a yoga teacher, I'm in honest appreciation of her depth of knowledge of the human body and how Pilates is to your benefit. Her instruction is very clear, yet easy to follow, with safety in mind. She also keep her classes fun while she makes sure you're not slacking in your efforts.
__label__5	"I personally went there after shopping around.  I'm a small business owner for 30 plus years. These guys do everything by hand, and they are not rushed because they are not on a line. They addressed things that the chain stores didn't want to address.  Because of the way the shop is run. each job is personally addressed to complete satisfaction.  They beat the other guys' prices, and they did what was needed to complete the job to satisfy the customer.  I've been around the block and back, you get your money's worth..
. David."
__label__2	Where do I even begin? How about $30 for 4 tacos.. and some chips and salsa. My husband ordered steak tacos and the steak was still frozen. Sub par food for a high price. My chicken taco wasn't bad and the salsa had a good flavor but overall we had a bad experience. We actually went to Taco Bell after we left and ate great tacos for $7.
__label__2	Hard pass. One of those businesses where you feel embarrassed for the people running it.  They weren't familiar with their own menu--serving sizes, prices, ingredients. Quite an awkward experience. So many places to dine in NOLA, find one of those instead.
__label__4	I would recommend this company highly. Brent was great. He knew exactly what was causing our garage door to pop back up. He explained what was happening and quickly repaired it. The service was excellent.
__label__5	OMG yum!!  From the escargot and turtle soup to the fudgy chocolate cake, everything was simply delicious.  We've finally found our new favorite Lasagna place.  Aaliyah was a delight and made a special night for us - don't miss this place.
__label__4	I went here for a Gel manicure and was very happy. Everyone was nice and helpful and they did a good job. Overall it was good value for money, fast service, and a relaxing and enjoyable experience. I will definitely be returning :)
__label__3	Ordered my usual for Ruby's- all vegs & salad bar, with an on tap Yuengling after I moved to the bar. I didn't even see a server for 10min while sitting at a hightop. The hightop area was super slippery too--chairs slide around on the tile floor. the Salad Bar was lacking a lot of veggie items I'm used to in Hawaii. Otherwise, food was normal. bartenders were a great improvement over the needs a lot of improvement servers( barely a dozen customers in this big place at time I went).
__label__5	Old hotel on the edge of the quarter. Long walk to the touristy offerings inside the French Quarter. Our king room did not have a window, but it was a really nice room. The bed was comfy and coverings were plush. High ceilings make the room appear larger. We loved this place. We could ride the trolly and enjoyed the walks to Bourbon St, Port O Call, Jackson Square etc. price was great. We stayed in January and for four nights was about $500. I'd stay again. Ruby Slipper is attached to the hotel. Nicely decorated and New Orleansy feels.
__label__5	"Some of the best middle eastern food I've ever had and I've had my fair share in Chicago and through my travels. An awesome family run business, hearty portions and good service. 

So glad we stumbled upon this place. Definitely will become a regular pit stop on our trips between Chicago and Cincinnati!"
__label__3	It's ok, not as good as the one in Tennessee. I will give them another try . maybe, just maybe I will be impressed.
__label__5	Had a 12p appointment and was done by 2p!!! My hair is soft, shiny and bouncy!...I still cant get over how quickly I was done!!! My hair was combed gently...I was not pulled all around or burned. Quan did an excellent job!!! Quan did mention it was a slow Sunday (rainy), so they might be why I was in and out.
__label__5	Food is always good. They've revamped the menu and increased prices which isn't bad. As I said the food is good and good quality but the broccoli in my seafood isn't a look but you can always ask for it to not be included.
__label__5	Best food at the airport period. Service was courteous, friendly and professional. Chris was perfect. Cleanliness of glasses cutlery was outstanding. Totally unexpected for airport. Prices are very reasonable. Makes me want to travel. Thanks
__label__5	This was my first time here and decided to try the rock n roll (no rice). It was impossible to eat with chop sticks but SO delicious. The service was great. Will be back!
__label__5	Had the Chole Bhature and the Gobhi Manchurian and the Tikki Chaat.  They were fabulous!  Expecially the mango/mixed pickle they serve with the Bhature.  The decor was quaint and cute.  Service was very kind.  Better than traveling all the way to Edison to get some great food.  Highly recommend.
__label__5	"I love going to Secrets salon in Hudson. I found it a few years back on a Groupon I think and I haven't stopped since then. Bobbie is fun, friendly and does a great job with my hair. 
Secrets is definitely somewhere or you are going to want to check out, I can't believe I haven't given a review until now and. She definitely deserves it."
__label__1	I've lived in this area for over 22 yrs and ShopRite of Haverford Av is in need of much improvements. Its the worst grocery store in this area. It has non Professional unpleasant employees. Poor quality produce, they always have expired food and items advertised on sale are never available or they never stock them. I ALWAYS seem to have a bad experience shopping at this grocery store no matter the day or the time. I wish the owners cared but they are there to make a buck and not be concern for consumers. It's sad this is offered to customers.
__label__3	The food was really good. The hostess was great! But our server was awful. Went thru my entire meal with an empty drink. Server was no where to be found.
__label__5	The breakfast is very delicious, the staff is very friendly and nice. Great place for breakfast I recommend everyone check out this place. Also very laid back and music is great.
__label__1	I ended up waiting for over 20 minutes after ordering my drive thru order. When I finally got my food it was cold and tasted disgusting.
__label__5	Amazing food and Amazing service! They know what they are doing! It tastes super authentic and you get that good home cookin meal you always are craving! I will recommend this place to everyone!
__label__5	Love this place and all the options.  The amish stands are great.  One of the best places in Philly to visit!
__label__5	Best and healthiest fast food I've ever eaten. Harvest grain bowl with chicken. Huge piece of grilled for $10 total.
__label__3	"Maybe it's because we came at lunch time and had a limited lunch menu, but the pad thai I ordered was mediocre at best. The noodles were very oily, the shrimp was overcooked and super tough, and the green beans (why are there green beans in pad thai?) somehow had zero flavor. 

The server even forgot about our order and I had to ask about our food after I noticed that tables who were seated after us had their lunches delivered to them already.

Really disappointed in this place since it had such glowing reviews :-("
__label__5	Best wings in town!  Staff is great and super friendly.  Highly recommend.  New location on Broadway is great.  Great place to watch the game.
__label__5	Kenrick's is my go to place for meaty catered meals, pre made homestyle meals, and along with my other favorite butcher ( LeGrands), the quality and customer service at the meat counter is top notch. I ordered Seafood jambalaya for a Fat Tuesday party and it was a huge hit.  Their holiday meals are a big hit too.  They could be a bit more efficient at check out, but other than that... Kenrick's is a meat market and home style catering shop that will always be on my list.
__label__2	"This place has a great selection but most everything craft beer is old, meaning some beer in this store is even past it's due date. This won't hurt you but I like IPAs or hoppy beers and there was not much of anything under 5 months old. I felt like I was at the dollar store for beers LOL. They do have sweetwater IPA on tap and is probably the best seller so you might be safe there, but if you are looking for really fresh beer and great service in the Nashville area go down town!! I get fresher beer from Kroger out here. 

Jason"
__label__5	Delicious. Really, I've never gotten cold or bad food from here. The food is always hot, delivered quickly and really good. I recommend the beef burrito and taco salad.
__label__5	I love Jamba Juice!!! Their smoothies are just good. Normally, I prefer to support local businesses rather than chains, but there's a reason there are Jambas everywhere - they're the best. Many different options, cool about substitutions, fresh-squeezed oj and wheatgrass shots... I'm addicted!
__label__4	Chicken parm was surprisingly light and well presented.  The smell of a great sauce drew me into the place. Service was very friendly and attentive. Booth seating was painful, ask for a table. Not sure why other reviews complained of pricing, my salad entrée beverage and desert was $35 net. Kitchen has capacity for larger groups. Had the seat been more comfortable or homemade pasta, I'd give this place another star. I'll definitely return.
__label__5	I have used Home Hero a few times since my last review and my experience has been A++.   I've requested the same contractor and each time he has met all of my expectations.  He arrived on time, was very quick in understanding what was being asked, executed perfectly and completed all the tasks in the time allotted.  Gold star for Home Hero!
__label__4	"Banana bread cake. Need I say more?

I've never had the actual food here aside from ice cream and cake. But they are both really good."
__label__5	Mr. Wright was very professional. His personality was great. He wore his mask and there was social distances at the shoot. Loved his work and was very impressed with him. Will recommend him to others.
__label__4	Wow...what a gem of Tucson!  We stopped in last week for a drink and really enjoyed the whole experience.  Great space and definitely want to come back when there is live music.  Friendly bartenders and just an all around cool vibe to this place.  Definitely a must stop when visiting Tucson!
__label__1	"blech. salty. over-priced. etc. my dining partner said, ""i would make myself throw up,  but then i would have to taste it again..."""
__label__5	Great Moscow Mules with Grey Goose w/Gosling Ginger Beer.  The Snapper & Shrimp special was out of this world with the Bang Bang Shrimp app & dessert for 2 for $50 was a great value.  Will be back again the next time in town.
__label__4	Fitz's is good hamburgers, excellent root beer and ridiculously huge root beer floats. Come hungry and save room to share a float.
__label__3	Very boogie place. If you don't have money you're kinda treated like nothing. ‍ really cool store, not the best vibe.
__label__3	"Convenient location next to campus but unfortunately they added jalapeños to my bowl even though I didn't ask for them. They also weren't serving their small bowl size, only their medium - wish they didn't have that on the menu if it wasn't an option.

10% off if you pay in cash"
__label__5	"This review is not for the actual park rather an event that takes place at the park.  The ""Art Walk"" from what I understand happens every Sunday at the park.  You will find beautiful art work, crafts, jewelry from local artists/designers on display for you to purchase.  The grounds of the park were well maintained, East Beach was clean and inviting, and on the main walk way is the ""Art Walk"".   Each vendor has his/her space to setup and show off their talents.  There was so much to see and enjoy and everyone was more than happy to share information about their creations."
__label__5	Ordered the hash browns bowl OMG! Sooooooo good But what made it even better was the excellent customer service
__label__5	"So so so good!!!!! A good homey hearty breakfast, with a delicious cup of hot coffee.! Mmmmmmmmm. Also, my husband LOVED the grits! 

I wish i had taken a picture of my Spinach Feta Omelet, and my husband Country Boy's omelette, it looked so good we just started eating."
__label__4	"Only sit at a bar!

We were promptly seated and then proceeded to wait for what seemed like an hour. In reality, it was probably only about 15-20 mins. I got hangry and annoyed so we moved to the bar.

Once we sat at the bar it was smooth sailing! We had fun and were served immediately! From that day on, we go straight to the bar when we come here and haven't had any issues since then."
__label__4	Good pizza with lots of choices to build your own. Haven't tried the salads. It's a bit confusing when you enter for the first time because of a lack of signs. Think of it as another Mod Pizza.
__label__5	Visited a couple days ago,and it was delicious. I had to stop cause I would have eaten all crab legs and shrimp.
__label__4	Wow, Pete's Famous Pizza was definitely fabulous. Everything about this place screams quality. I was quite impressed with Pete's Special Pizza, it was done perfectly. Fantastic food. All of the staff are super courteous - you truly feel welcome and taken care of. Thank you guys, keep up the good work.
__label__5	HUGE! That is the first word you will think when you walk in. This place takes up almost the entire length of a city block and is spotless! This brand new location is very well stocked and the staff is super helpful. It's a little off the beaten path from the Rittenhouse location it replaced, but well worth the extra few block walk.
__label__5	This was our first time. It was a Tuesday afternoon and moderately busy. Way too cool and windy to sit out in the tiki bar. Waitress was excellent and food was wonderful. Had grouper sandwich (blackened) and the signature salad. We enjoyed them looking out over the Tampa Bay and watching the tide come in. This is a great place we will definitely visit again!
__label__1	Do not do business with these thieves unless you like throwing money down the toilet! KRIS AND MIKE DO NOT RETURN DEPOSITS!
__label__2	First timer here. Ambiance is spot on, super casual and comfortable. Decent variance in tea selection and snacks/apps also available. Service however was poor. Cashier told me adding Oreo to the Taro Smoothie made him crap himself and told us he could not make it.. not the most appetizing thought. Went for the Taro smoothie and milk tea (no Oreo obviously..) the flavor was mild (mostly just milk) and boba was al dente. The extra large/24 ounce looks just like most other shops regular size. Wish it was a better experience!
__label__4	"Came in one morning before work 
Didn't want a big breakfast so I decided on the smoothie  .. smoothie was ready in a flash 
Place was clean will definitely try again"
__label__5	Hands down one of my favorite restaurants in Philadelphia. I've been here more than a half a dozen times and every time, the service has been friendly and the food delicious. I even love the restaurant itself-- the small cozy environment makes everything that much better. Try the spicy miso ramen (the pork melts in your mouth), with the steamed pork buns as an appetizer. So delicious! This is a must when in Philly on a rainy day...
__label__1	"I paid for contact lense fitting 
Was send home with trial 
After a couple of days i had issues and wanted to sed the doctor again
Calledtwice and was told i would be called back.
That was in January 
So i went to see another doctor 
Now i get a call that Target Optical wants more money since they have isdues withmy insurance now
I paid close to 140 already for basically nothing
I asked gor my glasses script teice
Nothing 
Seriously  has been a Trip"
__label__4	Cute atmosphere, definitely casual. The vegan veggie burger is AMAZING.
__label__1	They scheduled an appointment and did not show nor did they call to reschedule.  Apparently they do not need any work.
__label__3	I like the store Overall. I wish they had more of an organic section. customer service is a little slow. I do like the food selection otherwise. And the cashiers are always polite to me. The entrances are awful to get in and out of. On the other hand I've never had a problem with the product that I have purchased from the store. I've never had to return any food due to spoilage. The store is clean, and it's well lit. so it's a decent store.
__label__3	"Love the beer here
..love it!!!! My bartender was awesome!!! Hate the dozens of really strong perfumes on EVERYONE.   If you're allergic to stuff... go when it's not busy.  I'm serious.....Macy's perfume department all the way.

I'm going back foe the good beer and awesome bartender....at down time."
__label__5	This place is definitely the go to place if your craving a Bobbie! Thanksgiving on a fresh roll and it's fabulous! I would recommend this place to anyone!
__label__3	My husband and I went to Chili's for date night! Our waiter was slow getting to us, but was prompt afterwards! We both ordered the 6 ounce steak from the 2 for $22.00 meal! My husband liked his, but I sent mine back to be cooked longer! Both our steaks didn't even look the same! I just couldn't eat all mine, just didn't taste Right! My husband said let's not go back again!
__label__1	Probably had the worst breakfast ever this morning.  My husband order bacon and eggs, asked for bacon to be soft - it came back burned to a crisp. Asked for soft hashbrowns - again burned crisp and over easy eggs- came back over medium.  Nothing was right.  I ordered bacon and eggs and my egg was fine - sausage not so good.  The worst part is we took out of town company and we were so embarrassed after saying how good it was.  Will not be back after this terrible experience.
__label__5	I had an event for 50 people at Terra Nova in one of their private rooms. They did a phenomenal job and I am still getting compliments a week later. Dawn and Jen were the best waitresses. They were professional, courteous, pleasant, and attentive to all the guests' needs. The food was excellent - the taste and presentation were top notch. The price was in line with other places I've been too where the food and service were not near as good as it was at Terra Nova. Would definitely go back there to dine and to host an event. Thank you!
__label__5	The rib tips and potato salad tasted great. The staff was friendly and you get your food quickly. If you request sauce on your rib tips beware they pile on the sauce which is great, just have your napkins ready. Overall great food and good pricing for the amount of food you get. They don't give small portions like most other barbecue places. Come with an appetite.
__label__5	accidentally went to this pizzeria, ordered the Mexican pizza, one of the best pizzas I ate!
__label__5	"This review is for the Hotel:

It's a delight to stay here!  The hotel is well maintained and always clean.  There is no detail left behind - from the soft clean linens to the amenities.  You will feel cared for at the River City Casino HOTEL!"
__label__5	They were so so good! I will for sure be going back. Their banana split is AMAZING and the flavor choices they have are great! Definitely my new favorite ice cream place!
__label__5	"OMG Anytime Fitness is awesome! Lizzy was super helpful while signing me up and Amber took her time to introduce me to the equipment and answer any questions. My first class everybody was very encouraging.
If you want to feel welcome at your gym this is the place. It's nice to go somewhere, where the staff knows you by name, not just your member #."
__label__5	So good!  Catered for a Boy Scout  event!  Everyone raved about the food. Highly recommend!!
__label__1	My fault I forgot my glasses, after being inline and asking for assistance Fred- with a white ponytail suggested I go home and get my glasses and refused to read to me what the last name was so I could print it on the copy I was to keep. Insisted my copy had to be filled out! NEVER AGAIN. No wonder they want to close down the post office
__label__3	Maybe owner just got out of wrong side of bed, but he doesn't seem like a very  happy person. Not interested in my business either - a simple stereo hookup for which I already did most of the thinking. But the kid who actually installs stuff was nice, and the shop was tidy. I'm sure he does good work.
__label__4	We arrived too late to dine on the patio, so decided to place a carry out order. Our order was taken by Hannah who was so gracious and friendly. She invited us to sit outside while we waited and even divided the glass of wine we were going to share while waiting. Our sandwiches were hot and delicious. I even had a perfectly cooked and seasoned broccoli side. This spot is always busy and deserves to be!
__label__4	We always order for delivery.  Food usually arrives earlier than promised and is piping hot. The delivery driver is VERY friendly and it's always the same person. I would highly recommend getting crab rangoons and pot stickers for appetizers. For the main courses my wife and I like the generals chicken, orange chicken, and szechwan beef. This is by far the best Chinese food we've found in the meridian area.
__label__4	"I had the taste of new Orleans and it was very tasty. The hubby had the fried seafood platter which was just as good. Great atmosphere. Hubby said the bread pudding was ""just like I had as a kid"", but the crème brulee was very disappointing."
__label__1	"Ordered food and 20 minutes later I received a text that my order had been canceled.
No explanation."
__label__5	"Someone told me there's no good Thai in Tucson. They've clearly not been to Senae Thai Bistro. This place is on point and a hidden gem in downtown tucson. They have the classics like pad Thai and an assortment of curries, but they also have some next twists like Thai style paella and fried calamari with a tamarind sauce. 

For this quality you're going to pay a little more, but there lunch specials are a great deal for house of us that are more tight on the budget but still want fresh, quality food. Come and you won't be disappointed!"
__label__1	My 4th and last review of this location. I threw their menu away. Ordered a bacon cheeseburger and 2 order of wings, one plain, the other w/golden BBQ sauce. Could not even taste the bacon. Very little flavor. The wings, both plain and with sauce were overcooked. Parts of the skin were so tough, it was like trying to chew leather. The plain wings also had a funky smell, leading me to wonder how often they change the oil they cook them with. Goodbye to this place. Never again.
__label__3	Okay, I am generally not a franchise fan (says the Starbucks addict) but at least you know what you are getting. This particular restaurant has always done me well. The food has been hot and as ordered. The drinks have been delicious. The service has been good. It's my go to place at lunch when I don't feel like anything else, and I don't want to be disappointed.
__label__3	When I'm looking for good Vietnamese food this is where I come to. My friend introduced me to this spot. The experience was good, the vibe felt traditional. And I suggest this spot. ..
__label__3	It's a beautiful hotel, the staff is great. The rooms on the upper floors are small and dont have tubs, only showers. It was very disappointing that the rooftop pool is closed for renovations, which we were not told when we booked or arrived. We went down to the buffet for breakfast, it was ok but nothing exceptional like you would expect for $140  breakfast for 4 people! Very expensive for so little amenities.
__label__4	"I think the kids who go to CCP are missing out by going to the carts instead of here for their breakfast sandwich. It's $6, but it's delicious and definitely enough to split with a friend. 
I ordered a pastrami-egg sandwich (with stock sauce), and I appreciate that the pastrami wasn't scrambled into into the egg! 

The guy who takes your order/cooks your food is a crack up."
__label__4	Finally had a chance to try this place. So glad we did. I had the ricotta prosciutto honey toast. It was so filling and delicious. Shares  a side of ratittoulle with my son. We both enjoyed it. He had the banana and nutella crepe. It was so filling. He brought half home. He also had the avocado egg toast. Needless to say he just had that for dinner and enjoyed it too. Fast, friendly and courteous service.  Hope it was the 1st of many visits.
__label__1	Dishonest management and sales. Promised a two year warranty, not true. Promised a 60 day warranty, again not true. Promised an interest rate on loan that was not true. Engine light came on half hour after purchase. Brought back the next day to return vehicle, would not accept the return. A week later had to plow $1000 into transmission as they would not stand by their 60 day warranty. Please look at the reviews before doing any business with this operation. I counted 48 one star reviews in the first 57.
__label__3	These taste good but if you are going to charge $3.50 for a tamale - put some meat in it! Lots and lots of Masa around a small portion of meat.
__label__5	Isaac was our photographer at our March wedding.  He was so great and our photos are beautiful, unique and professional.  And he is a really fun party guest!  He met with us prior to the wedding in order to see what type of layout and lighting we had and talked to us about the type of photos that we were wanting.  He came early to document the prep and stayed late in order to capture the feel of the party.  He went above and beyond as our photographer and worked with us after the wedding to get the prints right.
__label__1	Chili's is normally one of my favorite chains.  This has been very unpleasant experience.  The wife asked if house wine was BOGO.  They responded he's so she ordered a red merlot and it was not BOGO when she asked for the second.  The food we ordered was both cold which was funny because the food delivery person said watch out these plates are hot.  They touched it and said don't worry it's only lukewarm.  The same as the food.  I asked them to warm it up and waited for another 20 minutes because they gave us new food.  This took way too long.
__label__2	"I got a coupon via email from FiveStars that I had a 10 dollar off coupon on any 20 dollar order. I ordered online like any other normal human being does in these days. When I picked up my order, I was told I couldn't redeem my coupon because I ordered online... the email didn't specify that you had to place to order in person. 
Honestly wouldn't even have gone if it wasn't for the voucher that I couldn't even use. Good job with that catch 22, chariot! Redeemer beware"
__label__5	Stopped for a quick bite to eat on our way back from Goleta. Loved the burger and fries. Not fancy-simple beach atmosphere. We will definitely stop by again.
__label__4	Bookmans is what it is - you won't always find what you're looking for. I did find a N64 cable for the tv a couple bucks cheaper than the one on the Eastside woohoo! Just wish that every staff member I interacted with didn't make me feel like a bother when I asked them a question or needed assistance. I understand everyone has bad days but interacting with 3 employees and they were all standoffish and seemed annoyed to be bothered from what they were doing
__label__1	The company is deceitful! They offer you this great introductory deal to get you locked in under false pretenses and promises! The salesman lies to you saying instead of the normal $200 initial cost for the first treatment and then 30 day follow up tratmit will only be $59. But then after the 30 day follow up treatment (which was suppose to be included in the initial payment) they debit your account $129. You're paying $200, or close to it, regardless. As far as I'm concerned, they're thieves!! Do not use them
__label__4	We had a sofa that was inherited with an awful fabric on it but a great design so we had it covered in a very nice patterned fabric. The did a very nice job in keeping the pattern placed properly and all points were done well. Very satisfied.
__label__1	Coffee is watered down and some of the staff are rude.  Would avoid this Dunkin'.
__label__5	"This place is super friendly and very helpful!  The design is the wooded walls, black chalkboards, and a dark and intimate dining experience. 

The egg salad on toast is a yummy start to a delicious lunch. Continue on with the curried sweet potato and lentil soup, yum! 

I'm always a sucker for fried green tomato and this sandwich doesn't disappoint.  Definitely, try this place the next time you visit Indy Reads, it's right across from that amazing bookstore."
__label__5	"Visiting from New York. Beef Martini (Rib-eye sandwich) was 6.99 and very good. The staff was very friendly. We came for the Tuesday night blues jam - great music and great atmosphere. Fried dough was so good.

Fun place!"
__label__5	Try this place out
__label__5	August Rhodes was incredible. The food was delicious and the staff was extremely friendly and polite! Will definitely be coming back and recommending to my family and friends!!!
__label__5	Great food and atmosphere! I always do a create your own calzone, and it is always good! The service is friendly and quick!
__label__1	Worst service ever. Apparently only the drive-through is open which I understand with Covid but I waited in line for 10 minutes while people played on their phone instead of waiting on me or even telling me that I was waiting without a purpose even though I try to get their attention multiple times. I am an avid fan of Dunkin' Donuts and I will never come back to this location ever oh. And I know they weren't using the phones for work because I saw a girl checking out her Instagram and talking To another a police specifically about somebody else's picture on that platform
__label__2	"Ugh. Horrible service and nasty food 

We sat forever before anyone came over to our table. People came after us and got service before us. We waited again forever for our check. We were done eating for over 30 minutes.   Ridiculous!!!

We had the shrimp ceviche tostado for appetizer and it was good. 

The dozen oysters arrived  room temperature and had zero flavor

The Cameron  rellenos which are shrimp wrapped in bacon were nasty bad. They were burnt. The cheese inside is weird. We  hated it and could not even eat it

Terrible experience overall"
__label__1	MURDER MYSTERY DINNER was VERY, VERY BAD. Show was bad and the food VERY SKIMPY, don't go hungry, desert  was 2 pieces of chesse cake to be shared among 8 people, dinner was a plate to be shared with everyone and service was very slow, Cherry Hill location, for the money you can eat well surf and turf at a five star restaurant
__label__5	I have been shopping Vinnie Louise since they opened, and have continued to shop their website since I moved away from Nashville last year. I LOVE this place. They have excellent, on-trend clothing, and the prices are fantastic. They bring out new pieces often, both in store and online. Dangerous for my wallet!
__label__5	Yummy food, easy-going atmosphere, excellent service (thanks Lynsey!) make this place a favorite. Will definitely be back soon.
__label__5	Have gotten cupcakes from here twice now.  Brought some to work and people couldn't stop raving about the brown butter cupcakes.  Customer service was great as well - they boxed each cupcake separately for me with no extra charge.   Will be back!
__label__4	I brought my 5-year old daughter here and she really enjoyed making s'mores at our table! What a special treat!  And a great laid-back ambience - if only they'd had the fireplace going.
__label__5	So good! Used to go to the location in town and country, but now work in Creve Coeur and so glad there's another location out here!
__label__5	Been here about three or four times whenever I am in the area.  Always very friendly service and great sandwiches. Tried the meatball sandwich today for the first time and was absolutely delicious. Highly recommend. Great job!
__label__4	"Have eaten here a couple times.  Had pizza a few times and they are great.  Nice crust and a good sauce bring them together.  I recommend the 18"" if you like that NY fold pizza technique.  Prices are very reasonable and I highly recommend them for the pizzas, some of the best in the area, especially for the value you get."
__label__4	Pretty good food and service.. menu prices is way better than competitors... example halo-halo for $5 which u can taste and have more ingredients... so what are u waiting for.. lets eat
__label__5	Went for the muffaletta sandwich and wasn't disappointed. Huge sandwich with big bold flavors
__label__4	Have had nothing but good, reasonably priced service at the Jenkintown Zips. I take my suits there all the time.
__label__4	"This was a cute restaurant in Santa Barbara. It was a bit small inside and you can feel a bit cramped. We made reservations for a Saturday to celebrate our anniversary and we were seated with rose petals and a card at our table. So cute! 

Food was mediocre though. The portions was pretty small for the price. We ordered the venison and duck beast. The duck beasts were pretty dry and I ended up switching to the venison plate. We also ordered the molten lava cake for dessert which we really liked!"
__label__5	Great service. Great food. What more can you ask for? Ignore negative reviews about long wait times and parking tickets. It's in a busy area and they aren't responsible for making sure people know how to park.
__label__2	Well panda failed again, ordered 3 different plates and 2 out of 3 were messed up. Ordered orange chicken and they gave us generals chicken, the other plate was supposed to have beef and broccoli and all it was was broccoli at least put sauce on it. On top of that the wait was horrible even when they told us on the app on what time to be there. Make sure you open your order before you walk away, until this covid crap is over don't waste your time going.
__label__1	This place is atrocious. The short, young Asian women that seems to always be working there is very rude and clearly is a relative of the business owner. She is not at all suited to be taking orders. In addition to the poor quality of employees, the food is not great. What's worse is the fact that Webster Garden doesn't accept credit or debit cards. I guess they don't know that the year is 2016 because every business in Webster Groves accepts cards, even the very small Chinese restaurant across the street. I predict this poor quality restaurant won't make it much longer.
__label__5	Awesome experience Jai was the greatest ever!!! Very nice funny and helpful!!! LOVED IT!!!!
__label__5	Great place, great food, great staff! They always make you feel welcome. It is family owned and operated. Great place!! Thank you
__label__1	Living in the 1960's! I had a brace put on at an urgent care facility in Cherry Hill which was then billed to me by Bonel. They sent the invoice to me 8 months after I received the brace and do everything via mail. You cannot make a payment online, request a receipt online, anything. You have to call, but they are only open 9-5, M-F. How does this place stay in business ?!?
__label__5	Couldn't have chosen a better way to buy a car. They got me approved for such a great deal that I didn't expect in years. Actually saved me over $6000. A lot of other dealerships are shady, but this one felt like I was with family. Snacks, lounge, friendly people. Thanks Guys!!!!!
__label__5	THis place is delicious! A must try. They have a wide variety of look carb options that are to dIe for! This place is worth the drive from St Louie! Best desserts especially for those that follow a keto diet like me :)
__label__2	SO EXPENSIVE. But it has a lot of neat unique pieces of clothing, jewelry, shoes...etc. maybe if I had a lot of money to blow at a store I would buy something here, but the fact it's a thrift store....I would never. Everything I liked was over fifteen dollars...really?
__label__3	I think I'm the only person in Carmel who is not a big fan of the food.  The staff is always friendly and accommodating.  I want the food to be great because this place is almost walking distance from my house.  But the three times I've eaten here, nothing has tasted so good it makes me want to come back.
__label__4	"Steve's Prince of Steaks in the Northeast makes a very good cheesesteak. 

The meat they use on the steak is thicker, similar to Geno's style (using the Pat's vs Geno's comparison method) although I think Steve's does it better than Geno's when it comes to the taste. 

Definitely a good place to stop and grab a cheesesteak if you're in the area."
__label__5	Dry-rubbed chicken and pork ribs that were tender and not greasy. Some of the best barbecue meat that I've had. Solid sides of the usual fare.
__label__4	Awesome service - fun atmosphere! Very trendy and worth the drive from Clarksville. Similar prices to nearby salons. What could be better than a glass of wine while you wait?! 20 options for your own scent! Would definitely come back. Be sure to make an appointment on the weekend!
__label__1	I didn't even get in to an appointment! I signed up two weeks ago because the doctor listed (Brosman) was on my insurance website as someone who took my insurance. I got a call Saturday morning explaining that they don't take insurance on Saturdays and apparently I wasn't even seeing the doctor I scheduled myself to see. They sent me to Exton, PA or told me to schedule on a Tuesday. I don't think I'm bothering.
__label__4	"Deep belgian beer list. Not particularly cheap on the beer. I recommend the Gulden Draak: insane carmaely goodness.

I had a severely underdone burger here once. Did not like that one bit.

The muscles are a good deal. And passable. Not transcendent or anything, but you will be full for ten bucks! They come with nice breads and things to sop up the broth."
__label__4	Consistently tasty food.  The new chili con queso is the stuff of dreams.  The staff is courteous and conscious of food allergies, which is always a vital criterion when it comes to feeding the family.
__label__1	The rooms are nothing like the photos you see when You book the room and as I came home one night there a ducking roach walking across my bed. Dirty and dingy stay somewhere else
__label__5	"We tried to get a dinner reservations a few times but they didn't have available times so we went ahead and tried Cochon for lunch (reservations via yelp/open table).

I think this is my favorite place to dine in New Orleans.  When we come back in town, I will definitely try and secure a dinner reservation.  This is the place you wish you had more than one stomach to eat more food.  Delicious!"
__label__5	Out early Christmas shopping and this place caught my eye.  Looked up their menu and decided to try.  OMG! What a pleasant experience!   Every staff member is not just polite, but they are FRIENDLY!   From the order to delivery process plus being checked on!  They even asked if I wanted salt and pepper with my soup!   Plus the food is great!  Tomato bisque with a grilled Italian sandwich.   Wish I lived closer, I'd be back a lot.  Great job to this staff and management.   A+
__label__1	place was absolutely awful. service was good and that's the only reason i gave it one  star. place was made in the 1960s and the decor wasn't updated since. the food was awful, they messed up raviolis. how can you mess up a ravioli? i went to order a steak and the waitress told me the cooks didn't even know how to cook a steak. i had the chicken parm with pasta and am currently pissing out of my ass. awful place with awful food. would never go back.
__label__5	Freakin GREAT!  From the best salads for both guys or gals... to the entry's, to the unbelievable deserts.  All made the Ole fashion way.   If you can get to this restaurant, do it!  VERY Fresh, cooked to order, amazing and flavorful food!
__label__5	Excellent friendly service. The charcuterie and selection of cheeses was very good and plentiful. The Padilla was sensational and we couldn't finish. Found it by mistake will be back on purpose on our next t
__label__5	"Cecelia is great!

I've yet to have a bad experience at a Great Clips."
__label__1	Strange menu would have liked to have some traditional items on menu . I ordered a cup chili it was very salty tasted like coney sauce they use hot dogs . I ordered a frisco melt the sauce they put on sandwich made the bread soggy and not appetizing. They should use sourdough bread for sandwich instead of garlic bread sandwich falls apart . This restaurant has a lot work to do starting with the menu. They need hire more ppl instead only having 2 visible ppl working ( one bartender 1 waitress) that disappear after taking order not reappear till food is ready.
__label__5	"Food was excellent !  first time here bloody Mary's with bacon flavored vodka what can go wrong there nothing it was outstanding
We tried the chicken fried steak breakfast fried potatoes and I had that pancake and eggs and bacon yum!"
__label__5	Excellent artist, very responsive and talented. The prices were reasonable. I would definitely recommend her.
__label__5	When I think excellent customer service, rental companies do not come to mind. However, this the two people that helped me at Enterprise were friendly, happy and knew how to get you taken care of quickly and effectively. I will definitely be back here for future renting
__label__2	"Just picked up an order of sushi and Thai food. The sushi was OK the Thai food was horrible.  

The pad Thai tasted like noodles with brown gravy and the other dish was just terrible.  

I've actually been going to restaurants in this location for over 35 years and unfortunately I don't think I will be back."
__label__5	This was the best recommendation! They are clean and thorough. I am hard to please because I know a thing or two about nail technique, but they blew it out of the park. This place is a gem. They keep it simple and they deliver perfection!
__label__4	"Travel Post! Came here after a long day of hikes. It was a perfect small lunch spot. We ordered an assortment of different Empanadas. I really appreciated the vegetarian options for my parents. The Chicken empanadas were delicious and  spicy. If you like spice this place doesnt hold back! There spicy chimichuri sauce was really was delicious and really had a great flavor. The textures of the empanadas was exactly what we were looking for.


If you are in the mood for a quick snack or a light lunch I would definitely recommend this spot."
__label__5	"This place is as good as it gets, honest. I really love everything about this place from the seating and setting, the service and of course the the best tapas in the city.  
If available on a nice late evening try sitting upstairs on the balcony, a great setting looking out over Magazine. The service here is excellent and unlike a lot of places in Nola, completely unpretentious. The food is tremendous and you can tell a lot of love and care is put in every dish. Seriously, nothing here is bad."
__label__2	Came to the TN Fair Grounds with my son in law to the gun show. It was a small venue and I'M sure there may have been a wider selection on the first day. There were almost more knife vendors than gun dealers. The restrooms were clean but marked poorly. A man came out of a stall in the women's restroom as I came out to wash my hands. Just like any sale, you have to known your prices.
__label__5	Amigo Nachos a pitcher of Ritas and tip for 30 bucks, more than my wife and I could eat and drink, both are a very well done. I have had Mexican food all over the   USA and they do these two things right.
__label__5	"First time and it was amazing. My server, Carter, was the greatest, attentive and his recommendations we're excellent. Thank you Carter

Update -- Back tonight for my third time and once again Carter was right on with his recommendations. Loved the chicken & waffles. Carter is a great and efficient server!!  Thanks again Carter."
__label__4	Excellent tacos and burritos. That's all I've tried. Tempura fish all the way. Burritos could be cheaper than Qdoba, my only gripe. Nice staff and beer selection.
__label__5	Great neighborhood spot.  Clean, friendly, and over-delivered on food and service. Flat Iron is amazing. Pierogis are some of the best I've ever had. Great beer selection also.
__label__4	At first I wasn't sure I was going to like this place because it was super crowded and definitely old but the very strong purple daiquiri quickly made me not care that it was cash only or only one bathroom with a line. If you can grab a window seat it's the prime place to people watch bourbon street & drink but BRING CASH! Fast friendly service
__label__5	New years eve...martinis, tray full of sushi, good friends in our covid bubble...awesome way to kick out 2020!   Thank you Oishi...sushi is always fresh, delicious, reliable and soooo good!
__label__4	I just love it here. The food and wine are just so yummy and I love that almost everything is healthy and fresh. I highly recommend the butternut squash soup! So good!
__label__2	Awful bland food. Even $5 for happy hour specials feel like too much for the quality of what I ate. One extra star for the really good playlist during happy hour and the bustling crowd on a winter night which livened up the experience. But please. Do not waste your money on food here.
__label__3	Decided to have my lunch break here and ordered a sashimi burrito. They gave me the wrong burrito, it had like yellow tail and shrimp tempura in it, but it was still good. I would recommend checking your order before leaving. I was already at work when I realized it was the wrong burrito
__label__5	Great late night sushi! Don't let reviews fool you. 6th floor is the spot after the bars.
__label__5	How great to have a little local Post Office, and be able to buy cards and fun packaging or a magazine whilst waiting. They have many unusual and inexpensive gifts as well. Jan and Eva are so nice!
__label__5	"Received the most beautiful arrangement  to celebrate my 70th birthday from three wonderful friends.  They were late because someone did not order from Jennie's the first time and the original order was never delivered from ""that other florist"".  Jennie's more than made up for that.

Of course, I was not at all surprised as Jennie's is my florist of choice in Tampa. They have never disappointed me!"
__label__4	"Long overdue review! My husband I went here with another couple after Thanksgiving but before Christmas.  I loved everything about it from the ambiance to the food. The lobster Mac and cheese was delicious of course but the rest of the food was tasty too!   I don't normally order mixed drinks with dinner but the ""Franktini"" was delicious after dinner (chocolate martini special the bartender is known for). Also the owner was there and was very welcoming to us when she heard it was our first visit."
__label__4	Great place friendly staff.   A little over priced but a great place to chill. Clean environment.
__label__1	Our pedicures were extremely rushed. We bought the most expensive pedicures and they lasted well under an hour, including the five minutes you get in the massage chair, which you have to move to after. They have you on a timer and want to get you in and out asap. Also, there was no wine, just watered down sangria.  My mom said it was the worst pedicure she's ever had for the price, so we won't be going back.
__label__5	Omg this was so yummy   so recommend to go here and this ice cream. You choose yourself the combination of different tastes!!
__label__5	The reviews don't lie! Really amazing view during sunset, the wait system is pretty cool. They take your number and you can see a live update of where you are in the queue. The line moves really fast and you are right on the beach so it's not really bad as you can pass time taking pictures by the beach. The drinks were really cheap and the food portions are huge. The servers all seemed so nice despite being so full all the time. Loved this place in every way possible!
__label__5	My first and only Philly true love. I found you when I first moved to the river wards in Summer of 2008 and haven't grown tired of our relationship at now Summer of 2013. We've had our rough times...the winters of drinking vodka out of wawa cups in the mid afternoon during stretches of joblessness and our excellent times of late summer nights showing you off to out of town acquaintances. I love your view of the city which I never get tired of, your constantly changing cast of characters, and your general underratedness. Stay the same.
__label__3	New Orleans is definitely dog friendly in restaurants. The two cutest dogs sat near me in the bar while I ate my food and one began to shake its hair and INSTANTLY I was reminded why pets should not be allowed in restaurants. It kinda grossed me out. But the ppl seemed pretty friendly. I got the vibe that this was a popular spot amongst pet owning locals. The music videos were hilarious. I'd have given the review 4 stars except for the dog shaking in the bar.
__label__2	Ordered the Charcuterie board which should include a fair amount of cheese and meats however there was only one type of cheese manchego and there was a butter and cream cheese mixture nothing else for $50 quite a rip-off, lots of fruits and vegetables but not much in the meat or cheese department at all don't waste your money.
__label__1	"Hands down worst nightclub! Plan on being harassed and pickpocketed... after only one hour in the club, a man harassed my friend to distract her while stealing her phone out of her purse. Upon telling the bouncers, they all just laughed like it was a normal occurrence (after reading other reviews it obviously is). While asking the bar tenders who to contact in the morning for a ""lost"" phone (or in this case, stolen out of our purse) the bartender laughed in our face and ignored us. Worst customer service I've ever received. Staff is a nightmare."
__label__5	Stopped in for breakfast on Saturday morning with a friend. We ate outside. Great service, food, and tea. We went inside to pay bill and were excited to see the re-modeling. Large screen TV and bar seats on one side, and tables on the other side. This location has been many different restaurants, and really needed a make-over! Too bad they don't serve draft beer! Would definitely return!
__label__5	I got my hair cut today by LB and it was great! She gave me exactly what I was looking for, a new style that is easy to manage, and I'm so happy with the way it turned out. Mirror and Mantel is full of friendly staff; everyone is so nice there. I will definitely be making regularly appointments there. I made the appointment about 2 weeks in advance and the price is reasonable for the quality of the haircut. The salon is a neat spot as well, really clean and stylish.
__label__5	I loved the feel of this restaurant and the food was even better. I could not get enough of my shrimp and grits and the gumbo was great as well.
__label__4	I really enjoy this race track. There is a sitting area outside that at accessible from the parking lot. The gas is always cheap. Clean beverage bar area and good selection of food item.
__label__1	The food was horrible. Service was slow. Which is a shame because the atmosphere inside is pretty cool.
__label__4	Great little arena, nice seats from everywhere and lots of great dining options within walking distance
__label__4	One of the most aesthetically beautiful ice creams that I have eaten! I was able to combine two flavors when I ate here. The ice cream can be a bit on the pricier side (even more if you add the macron), but I would say it's worth the experience. As others have mentioned though, it may start immediately melting if you get during a season when the weather is hot outside. Nevertheless, the shop is super clean and neat and very efficient. I enjoyed the flavors of the ice cream that ate and the creation was a work of art!
__label__2	"The gym is very clean and well maintained.  This location is also always packed, and the staff isn't helpful if you need something.  

Also, watch your contract closely.  The timeframes dont always match up with what the salespeople tell you.  Cancellation at the end of your contract term requires a written request be sent to them.  

Just wasnt the gym environment that I am looking for."
__label__2	Terrible service on Friday afternoon.   I arrived with 5 friends for a glass of wine.  They were busy, but there were three two top table available.   The same six of us had been at Sasha's the previous Friday afternoon and the staff helped us move the same three tables together!!  Last night we were told not to move the tables.  They were saving them if three separate couples would walk in!  If I had a business I would serve the customers standing there, not wait for the possibility potential customers.   All staff was ruder than rude!  We spent our money at a much friendlier St. Louis establishment!
__label__5	This is the best store I have ever been. I always get 5 stars treatment there, even when I go just to check it out. They are honest and sincere regarding the care of certain materials. We have one sales person that is always available for my husband and I. She is adorable! Louis Vuitton makes the best bags for a very reasonable price (compared to other high end designer brands) and I am absolutely addicted to that place!! Whoever felt they got bad service there, should try it twice! By the way, the gentleman is definitely a gentleman, he is extremely polite and helpful!
__label__3	This place has an awesome outdoor area.  Other than that I don't think it much different than its sister place in Nolibs which is a little closer to me so unless I am visit friends in the area I'm probably headed there.  But I might venture out here on a nice summer day to sip margarita if I am in that kind of mood. The classic are the best, my friend a fan of the flavored one but I wasn't.  Oh and the mushroom quesadilla were to die for so tasty.
__label__4	"It's one of my favorite malls! It's big with a lot of stores! Can it be a bit better? More than likely but it works for my shopping needs lol! 

It has most stores that I frequent at -- especially when I do not want to order online. It's nice to shop around, dread trying on clothiers in the fitting room (but go anyway), and say, ""I look pretty good in that outfit""! Sold! Anyway, I like this mall...a lot!"
__label__5	Hubby , Family , Friends and I had a blast . About 45 of us celebrated my Brother in Law B-Day . It was so FUN !!!! We enjoyed everything. The Server Mallory was on it . Her service was Excellent and she was very pleasant. The ladies that issued the bowling shoes was very inviting. The Food was very good . Thank you to all and Happy Holiday.
__label__5	In from out of town. Tried this place on a recommendation from a friend.  Avocado salad was excellent, but the mussels were the best I've ever had. Hands down. The broth is a coconut milk base with tons of curry and other spices. Fantastic. Can't recommend this place enough.
__label__5	Delicious!! We have been here 4 times in the last month! The food is so unique and honestly the best Persian food I've had in Nevada! And the best Ghormei  Sabi I've ever tried! The owner is very friendly and makes it a point to greet all customers in his chef outfit--so cute! The service is excellent and they always have some great suggestions! Definitely worth checking out!
__label__3	I've only bought my readers here....self explanatory. It gets busy during the first & second weeks of the quarter and I think it's pretty pricey
__label__5	"The best seafood restaurant east of Kuaui. Really.
In Indianapolis. Yes, Indy. GO! No, RUSH to Jacks. It's really good."
__label__5	I was the recipient of flowers from Alpha Floral. It was a lovely arrangement which lasted a long time. I have already recommended them to others and will use them myself in the future.
__label__2	Very disorganized and dirty. It took an hour to be served. We had to finally ask to get a menu. The food was not impressive. It just didn't get it together. Very inexperienced crew I think
__label__4	Good little brewery.....emphasis on little! But it is worth a stop!! Solid beer selection. I was most surprised by the honey and watermelon beer, both refreshing and complex (which you wouldn't think). But the beer that stole the show for me was the BLU SNO PORTER....which is a blueberry white chocolate porter...yep I SAID BLUEBERRY WHITE CHOCOLATE!!!! Holy bananas this beer is good!!!! I am intrigued and I will be back!
__label__4	Definitely worth the money. Hello! Free beer, wine, soda, and rum runners. Food was good and it's a buffet style. Sunset cruise was neat and we saw lots of dolphins. Decks 1 and 2 are air conditioned while the 3rd is an open air deck.
__label__3	they started serving breakfast, and its a good deal: two eggs, two bacon, two sausage, and hashbrowns for about five bucks. not bad. the food isnt the greatest, but its reasonably priced--especially the breakfast. the burgers are mediocre and the mexican food isnt too great, but its a dependable place.
__label__1	When I looked out our front door around 8:30 last night, I saw a package on the landing.  It was my wife's insulin delivery.  The driver did not knock, ring the bell or call us, and we were on the first floor all day.  How long was it there in the Philly heatwave?  Ice paks were  liquid and the pens were just a little cool.  The drug supplier took the information and said to also call UPS.  Transferred twice, got a 24 minute wait.  Tried emailing, but screen never opened. Delivery drivers cannot do this, it is wrong.
__label__4	Kitty was great!  I did a 60 min massage and I was able to get appointment same day.  The facility is clean, nothing fancy.  Asked for extra blanket due to being cold which was quickly provided.  Prices are appropriate for services at this facility.  Will go back
__label__4	Subculture urban cuisine was closed. We had just missed them. So we went next-door to Sriracha. We were not disappointed. Plenty of food. At a decent price.
__label__5	They were absolutely perfect! Apparently I had pneumonia, who knew? They were able to get me treated right at that location. All of them were so nice and so helpful.
__label__5	Had to get emissions checked and car inspected. No issues found and appreciated that he did not make up or invent car problems to try and get more money. Quick same day service and pleasant service.
__label__3	"I had never been to a sushi conveyor belt restaurant before and sadly this one kind of disappointed me. The vibe was off. 

I will say I really enjoyed the sweet potato roll and the sashimi! 

One thing I did like was that they also served fruit abs desserts through the conveyor belt."
__label__5	I LOVE their soup and grilled cheese combo. I've ordered it on 90 degree days because its just that good! Friendly atmosphere and good service. Will be going back many more times.
__label__4	Not sure if there's anywhere else in the city where you can get delicious short rib sliders, a perfectly made cocktail, and some D.L. Hughley jokes besides this place. Will might be my favorite bartender of all time. I recommend going just to hang out with him!  The delicious concoctions he makes are a damn good bonus.
__label__3	Tasty guac and civiche.  Fast and friendly.  Delicious fish tacos!
__label__4	Love this Italian restaurant. It's always crowded on the weekends, so prepare to wait if you don't have a reservation. My husband loves the steak. I don't have a favorite dish, but I don't think you can go wrong with anything. Try the limoncello cake for dessert!
__label__1	We ordered Uber eats from here and it was awful.  Falafel was burned or cooked in old grease.  Prices are ridiculous for the quality of food you get.
__label__5	Viva Las Vegan is a force to be reckoned with! Their food is incredible, their service is beyond 5 stars! My husband and I love this place, but I got some non-vegan coworkers to try it and they were so impressed. Support black owned, family ran businesses y'all!
__label__4	Just really solid pizza here. Plenty of cheese and sauce, with a medium thick crust that's just crispy enough. I usually get with pepperoni and chopped garlic, at least a few times a month. Could be a bit less expensive.
__label__5	OMG so delicious! We always get BBQ from the trailer when at Metazoa - delicious brisket, pulled pork & sides of Mexican street corn that are to die for. The smoked meats are extremely flavorful as is their BBQ sauce. Definitely worth the $$.
__label__5	I love love love coning here to eat. It is a bit pricey but it is so worth the money. They have an amazing ability to serve you food that makes you want to just keep eating and never stop! And don't even get me started on their ribs...to die for! You have to try their steak as well. Just an overall delicious and warm and welcoming atmosphere. It can't get any better than Holdren's steak and seafood!
__label__4	We have been here a couple times and have always enjoyed their fresh food offerings.  You rarely see a salad bar anymore and they have a great one.   Nice kid meal offerings and free ice cream for everyone.
__label__1	The quality of the food has gone completely downhill.  He's the only game in town and overcharges for basic American Chinese food dishes.  I hardly ever see anyone go there anymore.  One star- last time ordered from there we got $50 worth of food and had a coupon.  He granted the coupon but I felt like it was still very expensive for what we got.   We all got sick from our dishes so not sure if something wasn't cooked correctly or handled incorrectly.  Please be wary of this place.
__label__3	Drinks are priced well.  The environment itself is different seems almost like a banquet hall.  Overall I enjoyed the place and the crowd is decent.
__label__5	I've been going to Alicia now for about 8months now and I could not be happier! She is so thorough with every service I have ever had. Not to mention my eyebrows have never looked better!!!!! The environment is so comfortable and relaxing as well! You will not regret seeing Alicia!
__label__5	"Fantastic food , I was surprised . Get the chicken fried steak with gravy and 2 sides
Loved it 
Salad was awesome too"
__label__3	Stopped by here on out road trip and were not entirely impressed with the food. It tasted good but was not super flavorful. However we did love the mint iced tea!!
__label__4	The food was great, no wait, great service. I would've have just liked a nice brew on the side but otherwise it was all great. It has a very nice atmosphere.
__label__1	Don't ever come here EVER!!!!!  The staff is rude. Appear to be lazy as they are always eating the food they sell every time even behind the counter.  Unprofessional language and I'm not putting what they said on here.  Just pick a different place to get food from.  Don't spend any money here until the staff is overhauled!!!  Also the food was cold even though they just handed it to me.  Worst experience of my life!!!!
__label__4	Great spot. Big inside and a nice patio outside. We had great service. The fish spread was delicious. I really enjoyed it being served with veggies in addition to the crackers. Never tried that before and we really liked it!  I had a salad and my fiancé had the turkey burger. Both were delicious. Great great craft beer selection!  We will be back!
__label__5	Great food, good beer. Lighting was a bit dark. They have a lot of good beer selections and a nice sizable menu.
__label__4	The menu didn't strike me as exciting at first, but after I ordered the jambalaya crepe, the waiter totally perked up (and yes, I ordered second).  It had a sweet flavor from the grilled onions, but also filled with shrimp, sausage and cheese.  Totally loved the wheat crepe as well - good place to stop.
__label__1	I'd suggest going to a different branch. This branch has undergone a cosmetic make over but the underpinnings are the same.  Way too busy, not enough staff, a rather rougher crowd...
__label__2	I was happy to find a local coffee spot so close to my house, but after a few visits, I will not be returning. The staff are not masked, and customers do not wear masks despite the fact that the cozy space often requires them to be in close proximity to one another. In terms of service, the staff consistently give a vibe like we are interrupting them. On the plus side, the snacks and coffee have been good. Overall, the cons are not worth it for me.
__label__4	"Even though there is nothing fancy to the track or to the clubhouse, this is definitely one fun place to be.  The races are exciting and people get really into it.  I have lived here for 2 years now and did not now that this existed.  It makes me wonder what other hidden Tucson attractions I have missed.  

It is a fun place to go with a cool group of people, drink margaritas and make minimum bets based solely on the name of the horse.  Definitely will be going back."
__label__3	Food is creative though a bit off from the authentic source item. Ramen was interesting if slightly saltier than normal. Service was solid as was ambiance. Drinks were OK.  They were either on the overly sweet side or were dominated by one flavor. Don't expect Cure level nuanced cocktails, but for the price its worth trying at least one or two to start your meal off with. Parking is on the street and free.
__label__5	I have been using Castle Dental for the past 10 years and it is awesome! Dr. Graham is amazing and the staff is as well!! If you need to get your teeth worked on for a reasonable fee, this is the place to go! Their office manager is amazing as well at working with you on payments etc. They have great plans set up!! Thank you Castle Dental!
__label__5	This tour company is one of the best, low pressure tours I've taken in a while. We took two tours, one of Logan Circle with Joseph and another of The Old City with Glen. Both tours and tour guides were incredibly engaging, and well worth the reservation. Make sure to make reservations online beforehand, but my boyfriend and I made ours a few weeks in advance and had no issues whatsoever. Bravo Free Tours By Foot!
__label__5	The ladies who work here are so nice and efficient! I'm greeted every time and they are always very honest. I take all my pants here for hemming and I've had a couple of things altered and tons of dry cleaning. I'll be keeping them in mind for my wedding dress alterations as I see a ton of dresses getting altered and cleaned here everyday.
__label__4	Probably one of my favorite places to go to. The Asian food selection in Santa Barbara is slim, but the ramen here is amazing. The texture of the noodles is great and the broth is so rich and flavorful. I typically get the craft with the pork belly. To nitpick though, I wasn't a fan of the cabbage they added and wished that eggs were included as well. I don't think it compares to the top ramen spots in LA, but it does come close for sb standards!
__label__5	Whether take out or delivery, this place rocks (and I never write reviews!) Delivery is super quick! The garden salad today was really good with quality lettuce instead of just iceberg! My husband's associates loved the pizza, too - three guys ate 1 1/2 larges:)
__label__5	Yes. Go here.  You will be happy here.  I believe our waiter said their cocktail menu is new; I really enjoyed my drink.... and maybe my husband's too.  THE BRUSSEL SPROUTS, oh yes.  Just yes.  Also had ravioli that I still cant shut up about. So good.
__label__5	Great chicken pot pies and wonderful customer services. They also have an excellent charcuterie selection.
__label__4	The Presidio is a beautiful motel that has proper amenities and is great walking distance from the fun and energy of State St. My wife and I were welcomed by the motel employee with promptness and our room was ready for us. The location itself has a great lounge deck on the second floor and gives anyone looking for a peaceful sunset a great find! The hardest, but understandable, part my wife and encounters while at The Presidio is the action that takes places on the second floor. Any luggage with wheels will be heard if you're staying on the first floor.
__label__4	A lot of different and unique donut flavors, but all of the donuts were delicious. The donuts were made to order. I would comeback.
__label__5	Cherry Hill Volvo makes you feel like home when you enter the doors. From the time I test drove my car till my series I have felt that they care about me and my car unlike other dealerships that consider you a number. Yosef the sales manager made the transaction easy and painless while when I get my car serviced or have a random question I can easily get a hold of Kellon my assigned service advisor who helps me solve the issue or schedule an appointment.
__label__4	Running almost on all cylinders. The first car had an odor and the guy in the lot did not let us upgrade but the woman behind the counter immediately upgraded us, no questions asked.  Take whatever car you'd like in that section.  Nice.  Easy to get out of the lot and an easy return, quick shuttles, super quick review of the car (I'm not even sure they really looked at anything) and the man who took my car found a watch I left in the car and found me in line for the shuttle.  Nice work guys.  Good people.
__label__5	This is one of our main grocery stores we shop at. For one, they got Poke Bowls, sushi, Teriyaki Bowls. which is a plus for us when you from Hawaii. Their enchiladas are bomb too, especially when you get them on price reduction. Prices are not the cheapest here but they do have good specials. Their employees are very friendly and courteous and treat you like family which is a big reason for a 5 Star.
__label__1	Called, and called, and called to order a pizza tonight...no answer. Last time they messed my order up anyway forgetting an item. Officially done with this place. Read the other reviews. You're better off literally anywhere else
__label__5	"Owner, Ted came out and did a great job cleaning my carpets.  He was super friendly and knowledgable and was not some kind of bait and switch like so many carpet cleaners.  Price was exactly as quoted over the phone and did not try to sell me all kinds of other services I did not need.

I also like the fact that you don't have to wait hours for the carpet to dry.

I highly recommend if you need your carpet cleaned without any hassel."
__label__5	I decided to try this place after not having lasting manis at Epitome. Once I stepped foot in here, I was very blessed. It's very nice inside, and their polish colors are amazing!!! Love the service here, the workers are very nice, and personable. Rose did my eyebrows and she did them better then anyone I had in Philly, and I lived here for 8 years. I still have the gel polish on my nails 3 weeks later!! Definitely last. Going back today for gel mani & Pedi.
__label__5	The line to grab a donut was incredibly long, but so worth it! They have so many options for donuts! Each time I return to Philly, I want to try a different one. The staff were very nice and helpful. The donuts were absolutely exceptional. If you're in Philly, you need to get a donut from here.
__label__4	"Updated: I don't use Yelp a lot, but I just noticed that the owner (Mark) sent me a message regarding my review.  He wanted to let me know about some of the special pricing and Happy Hour deals that they have, as well as thanking me for my feedback.  Pretty neat to see someone that engaged and responsive.  +1 star!

Pretty neat place.  Prices are a little high for some of the beers, but the selection is good and staff is helpful."
__label__2	Paid an exorbitant amount of money and got a tiny room and most of all a really disappointing continental breakfast you might get at a hotel 1/3 the price.
__label__4	Hard to find a hand car wash let alone a decent one. Great attention to detail here. The wash is a couple of bucks more than a automated car wash but worth it. They're fast and courteous. Added benny, they're across from Wegman's. So if you get your car wash and exit onto Haddonfield, you can legally make the turn into Wegman's parking lot.
__label__5	My wife & I have been to Landry's on more than a few occasions but never to this location. The view was great. They have plenty seating inside and out. The service was awesome and the food was great as well and plentiful. This will be our spot to bring guest when they come in town. It will also be one of our date night spots. Great experience!
__label__4	Best place on the island to get breakfast.  I've had a Western Omelette, poached eggs & my daughter has had the Creme Brulee French toast, Biscuits & gravy, among other things. Staff is great, very friendly.   So worth the stop for breakfast or lunch.
__label__4	"Creative, well-executed flavors, good service, decent prices, pleasant atmosphere. 
Skip the cookies... I ordered an ice-cream sandwich with one chocolate chip cookie, and one peanut butter cookie, and if I remember correctly, salted caramel-flavored gelato in between. 
I was very pleased with the gelato, but mildly disappointed with the cookie quality. It is not the best gelato I've ever had, but is quite good. I like that they have seasonal flavors and that they clearly put some thought into their flavor offerings, making for a nice palette of options."
__label__4	As a name, it speaks for itself.  American Airlines' Admiral Club is an oasis in the heart of the B/C Terminals of Philadelphia International Airport.  Though I no longer travel as much in my past career, I truly enjoy the amenities afforded by the Club.  You have to know you will be comfortable.  That is what I always relished.  Travel easy friends.
__label__5	I've come back about four times now and I don't even live in Tucson!! This place is amazing. Highly recommend the french fries as well they are hand cut, fresh, and delicious with some blue cheese!
__label__5	The best burger you will find in a lot of places and the best burger you will find in Nashville. This east side establishment is a popular destination for burger enthusiast. Their made to order burgers are juicy and mouthwatering to the look. They have a great bar area if you would like to take in the atmosphere. They also offer timely carryout where you can pick it up straight from the bar. In the warmer months the outside offers optional seating to get away from the roar of the restaurant setting.
__label__5	We had dinner here tonight for the first time and found it to be exquisite. The service was excellent, and the food was simply awesome. I had the filet mignon with mashed potatoes and vegetables. My wife had the gluten free penne pasta with marinara. We also had chilled prawns for an appetizer. Everything we ordered was beautifully presented and delicious.
__label__4	Qdoba is my go to Mexican spot. I used to go to chipotle and after having this I haven't been back. I normally go to the bryn mawr location which is a little bit nicer and has a bar but the food is the same at both. Haven't had a bad thing yet and the service is always good.
__label__5	Excellent food...mussels were great and fish tacos awesome.  Service was really good as well
__label__1	Terrible bar. Worst customer service. Manager was absolutely no help at all. Extremely rude.
__label__1	Terrible food. Terrible service. This is the first and last time here. Do not recommend this place to anyone especially if you were hungry.
__label__5	"Up there with the best authentic Mexican I've had in my life - By far the best in STL. It took me a long time to find REAL Mexican food here, but it was worth the wait. 

All of the tacos are delicious and inexpensive. It's a bit of a dive, but what's not to love about that."
__label__1	Ordered atomic wings and usually they are great BUT THIS TIME the sauce was OILED FILLED!  Sauce was so oily it took away from the spiciness of the wings ! THIS IS NOT THE SAUCE USUALLY SERVED and when I asked the cooks about it everyone acted as if they didn't know I what I was talking about.   It was a big disappointment. I spent almost 30 dollars in atomic cowboy today just to be let down by the quality !! I will not be back
__label__4	"Had the veggie burger with string bean almandine, lettuce ,tomato ,onion .
Just enough to eat everything.
First time for veggie burger & it was very good. Waitress Brianna was very kind & easygoing. She was knowledgeable in menu items."
__label__5	Super fast delivery, food is always great!! Have never been disappointed. I think they have another location in NJ too, I was there years ago and they were just as good
__label__1	"Cool venue, but the ""staff"" are complete jerks and ruin the entire experience. One bartender cut in front of 5 people waiting in line to use the restroom, then threatened to kickout patrons who ""had a problem"" with his disrespectful behavior. Not cool and unacceptable."
__label__1	You have got to be shitting me. One of the worst places I've ever eaten, airport or no. I got a Bloody Mary... disgusting, a total waste of freaking $11. Slimy, flavorless, gag-worthy. My husband got pancakes... I wouldn't be surprised if these came frozen and were heated up in a microwave. HORRIBLE. Don't waste your money.
__label__5	2 external atms where you can access money quickly. Located in a strip plaza. Went afterhours so can't comment on the inside
__label__2	Pet owners BEWARE Hotel is not pet friendly. Their policy does not allow you to leave dog in your room unattended even if crated......
__label__2	The Pharmacy needs staffing, the turnover rate back there must be terrible there are always 4 to 5 new faces... why does that matter? try and get a difficult script and then ask me.
__label__3	Good salads and appropriate prices. I wish they had a bit more in the way of sandwiches and side items like Devon Blakely
__label__5	I LOVE THIS PLACE! this was the first place where I tried Pho ever in my life, after almost 1 year, I've tried multiple places and this one is always the best. We are so happy this is close to where we live as we almost always order pick up. The restaurant if very beautiful itself and takes you straight to Vietnam  great food portions too. Everything is delicious here. So good.
__label__4	It was complicated to order for a first timer but we figured it out. The food was good and we enjoyed our experience. Definitely going back for the create your own bowl.
__label__5	"The best Indian restaurant in Santa Barbara. We drive from Santa Maria for the amazing food and great service. The restaurant service team is fantastic and makes you feel welcome. 

A must try if you are in Santa Barbara."
__label__5	"Hands down the best hamburger you will find in Tucson!. Why?. Their ground beef is the most tender I have ever tasted anywhere. 
hope they never compromise their quality with time like other places."
__label__4	Great food. Wait staff very friendly and alert. Prices are good. Atmosphere very nice.
__label__3	Came for coffee and a quick eat on a Sunday morning. Took a little long to get our food despite not being too busy. Decent breakfast tacos / burrito but would recommend others for the price. Good coffee, crafty baristas.
__label__4	Great dive bar, I was pleasantly surprised how good the food was. Perfect Happy Hour place. Check out the poster of Billy Idol in the girl's bathroom, hot.
__label__5	"All I can say is ""wow""! My family and had wonderful entries and appetizers. I highly recommend it"
__label__1	I went to Rilling's Bakery Saturday morning the Day before Mother's Day to pick up a Mother's Day cake and the cake was stale and burnt edges it was disgusting .  NEVER AGAIN. SAVE YOUR MONEY. NOT WORTH IT.
__label__5	Well Crafted serves up the best beer in Montgomery and Bucks County.  Offering various styles all of which are superb.  Often times it's too hard to decide on a single beer because they are all so good.  In particular, the saison's are very well made, however no option will do you wrong.  The scratch kitchen is good too- flatbreads, Bavarian pretzels, bahn mi, grilled cheese, etc.  I almost hesitate to post this review because I want to keep WC all to myself.  Cheers!
__label__4	The food was incredibly fresh. The spring rolls were crisp and crunchy, the sushi was moist and flavorful. The hibachi was perfectly balanced. The tempura was a little greasy and I will probably skip that during my next visit. The prices are very reasonable and the atmosphere is very relaxed. I plan on visiting frequently.
__label__5	So I've actually come to this place a few times over the last couple of months. It has not disappointed. Every meat choice is great! Even the veggie taco which is an old favorite for me growing up! I've done the all you can eat and for 20 bucks you gotta eat at least 13 tacos to make it worth it. Trust me, you won't regret it. The arroz con leche is phenomenal !! They have me coming back about once a week !
__label__5	The atmosphere is absolutely wonderful, feels as if you have ventured into a Parisian Cafe. Everything we ate was beautifully plated and the coffee was wonderful. Lunch for four and the staff was attentive. Bon Appetit!
__label__5	Signed up for a membership today after receiving a gift card for Christmas. Although I've been to other ME locations and this one was similar, I have no complaints. The entire place from the entrance to the waiting room to the massage room were all clean and peaceful. I had Joey who was fantastic!! Highly recommend coming to this location. Can't wait for next month.
__label__1	Worst Panera store I have been in. Ordered oatmeal and wanted to add blueberries and 20 mins later someone finally figured out they were out of blueberries!!! How do you run out of blueberries??  Lots of people working but was taking forever to fill orders. Lots of customers waiting and get this. No coffee!!!! Bathroom was dirty also. This is a constant thing. I stop there to use restroom while driving for uber but no more. Will have to find somewhere else.
__label__5	"Wow! I've had a hankering for good pho for ages and while other Tucson restaurants have let me down lately this place deserves 5 stars! The broth was savory and the noodles weee cooked perfectly. The beef was lean and delicious. I also tried Lemon Grass Chicken and Chicken and vegetables while I was here and they were great as well. 

The decor is spot on and the service was quick and friendly! 

We will definitely come again."
__label__3	"The food is typically really good, and the wings are some of the best in the area. However, the service is painfully bad. One time I went late at night when there was barely anyone there, and it took literally 10 minutes for anyone to even notice we were there to seat us. Then, once we're at the table, the server rarely ever comes out. They also ""forget"" to apply discounts when they're having specials. It really seems like the people who work there hate their jobs. It's also a bit overpriced, but nothing too ridiculous."
__label__4	I was very surprised I'd like this as much as I did. I don't eat meat or dairy, so my options are always limited at taco shops, ect. Their veggie tacos were quite good, and I enjoyed their chips and guacamole!
__label__1	They are happy when you buy a brand new car from them but if something goes wrong they won't help you at all and ask you not to come back. Don't buy a car here or get service done as they are completely unwilling to even try to fix your issue.
__label__3	"This is in the middle of everything so it is easy to make a pit stop after shopping and running errands. However, there is no drive thru... which leads to long lines. Patience is a virtue! Service is okay, similar to some other mediocre Starbucks. The retail section is a little small which leads to cramped wavy lines where you have to maneuver yourself around the merchandise. 

Seats are limited. Seats by outlets are even more limited. So grab a 2 seat-er while you can! Bathroom was not fantastic....  =-\"
__label__5	"This place is fun! And the views of the Ryman are fantastic!
The Indoor and outdoor seating options are equally good. 
Be sure to note they have a great brunch!! 
The extensive offerings of wines by the glass are a huge draw here... really enjoyable to sample the flights. But the food. The food! Yummy. All of it. 
Come with your hubby on date night. The girl gang for brunch. The parents when they come to town. It's a great spot for all of the above!"
__label__3	Good food soso service. Always hard to park, and long waits. Is it worth it overall? Hard to say. Better service would sway my choice more.
__label__5	"This place smells amazing and the employees of Savory Spice are always super nice.

They have literally any seasoning, sauce, even jams and whiskey mix, that you could possibly want and need. You can buy dry soup mix packets of a huge variety of flavors. 

Free samples, if you like tasting. 

I purchased the largest container of ""Nashville Hot"" seasoning some time ago and it's still fresh and delicious.

Check this location out for all your seasoning needs!"
__label__1	Every single time I have been here the staff has been rude and they have messed up every single order. I order and pay for signature sauces and they give me honey and not even the amount of sauces I ordered. My chicken nuggets are way undercooked and it wasn't even rush hour. Save yourself some future headaches and go to the McDonald's by the AMC theatre. It's a little further but the staff is decent and the at least get a simple order right. I've never been rude to any staff but this is ridiculous. The management is a joke.
__label__5	"Baan Thai is great for a dinner date or large parties of 8 or more. There is a good amount of space in the restaurant and you do not feel crowded in. The portions are large and all the food we ordered was amazing. The salads are also huge so I suggest sharing if you are ordering appetizers for the table with a large party. The service was good and speedy. We didn't have to wait long for our order. Its definitely a great go to Thai and BYOB spot in Northern Liberties.

I suggest the Pad Thai Chicken, Spring Rolls, and Money bags."
__label__2	The sites were ok. Our water and electric was in the wrong side of the camper so it made it hard to connect. The bathrooms were in desperate need of cleaning. Shower & toilet were also in disrepair.
__label__1	You OWE it to your bank account to READ the Google reviews of their service department stone cold rip offs !  They claimed that my review was inaccurate, but I have the receipts and records for ALL of it !  Bottom line is I spent thousands for a completely NEW AC system including hoses and EVERYTHING and still don't have an AC system that works !  They refuse warranty repairs, initially claiming a 2 year warranty on aftermarket parts and labor, then saying it was 2 months.  These people lie and defraud their customers for a comfortable living.  Run like hell !!! READ the GOOGLE reviews !
__label__5	The Quick: so much goodness and even surprisingly vegetarian and vegan friendly option! I love the veggie sandwich no cheese add aoili (skip the aoili for vegan option). My friends say the pork is the best they've ever had. Plus that sharp sharp provolone is all the rave. Must get the fries - the small is massive!!!
__label__3	The sushi, chirashi bowl, and sashimi is a great deal here. You can choose your cuts of fish and they will cut it for you and it's at a GREAT price. It's definitely my go to for sashimi. The other food items, however, are subpar. I had a ramen bowl and my date got the beef curry and rice. Both were lackluster in flavor and seasonings; I would never order them again.
__label__1	"Disappointed. Picked up lunch and the ""Vegan"" Field Roast included egg. When I picked up my food she said it was vegan even though she had previously said it had egg. I definitely won't be back."
__label__5	To my motorcycle in and they repaired it cost a little more than I had thought but there was a lot more problems than we ever imagined Big John was honest shop was clean service was excellent give me details all aspects of the work that was getting done of my bike I was very happy with Big John and his mechanic and then join my bike right now I recommend this service department mechanic
__label__3	Ok, we love the food but the service is iffy. I love the look of it and the deserts are amazing. If you in Hyde Park and looking for sweets, this is the place.
__label__2	"Probably the slowest ""fast food"" joint on earth.  Dave T most assuredly would not approve"
__label__5	Great place, delicious food. I had the scallops with rice, excellent. Waitress was fantastic. It was a Wednesday at 2 pm, there were a hand full of people, I sat outside. I heard it's more crowded for sunset. Small, divey place but excellent food. I will go back.
__label__3	Great salad!  Love their warm chips and salsa.  Could eat the chips plain.   We also ordered the duck confit dish- this was pretty small and served with a lot of fried potatoes (although the mole was delicious).  I will order the salad again with shrimp and another blood orange marg and skip the confit.
__label__1	No. Just no. It's sad that this is what passes for Thai food in Boise.
__label__1	This is the worst experience I have had for my entire life. I would say the service was soooooooo bad. The waitress has the worst service I have ever had. Anyway, I still gave her more than 15% tips, but she even called me a bitch in Chinese.
__label__5	I called for a same day appointment and they got me in! The technician was so kind and gentle, and my feet look and feel amazing. The price is steep but I feel it's worth it
__label__5	Amazing! Get there early as there is always a long line. Brisket sandwich is awesome and so is the Mac and cheese.
__label__1	BEWARE I have purchased a 4K Sony XBR55x850c from Best Buy that they recommended that would be a great tv now for the second time in three years it has went out I have Samsung tv in my other room some older then the Sony and still going now out of Warrenty they said I'll have to pay for it but they have to have a problem with there product that this is the second one in three years and it's out
__label__3	The food and service was great, but, I have to give it just an OK rating because we were charged a $10 corkage fee for each bottle of wine we had.  The problem, we didn't bring in our own wine, we were charged corkage for wine we purchased there!
__label__5	Staffs here are very professionally and courteous!!! If you have any issues or just want to know something staffs are very knowledgeable and willing to work with you also financially!
__label__5	"Hands down the best Thai Food in the Indy area!

The dishes are rich in flavor and the servings are family size.  We loved every single one of the five dishes we tried as a family.

Will go again!  Wish there was one in Carmel, or downtown, but will have to make out to Thai Select again!"
__label__5	My wife and I were blown away by the great food and great price.  The braised pork chop is phenomenal.
__label__5	Had a wonderful experience with MaryAnne at the salon. My hair color turned out wonderful, three colors and  the compliments were coming all day. I'd highly suggest a gift certificate for any mom, grandma, aunts, sister, daughters, friends will  totally enjoy this place
__label__5	"My puppy loves getting groomed here! Rachel is good with the dogs and is experienced! My puppy always comes home smelling so good and her hair is so so soft. 

We love this place and the location is convenient. I am picky about where I take my dog because I want to go with a groomer that is gentle with her but also gets the job done well. 

The only downside is that it's cash, check or Venmo only so no cards."
__label__1	"DONT COME HERE AT 7:30 when they close at8. Believe me. You'll hear how annoyed the staff is that your there.  And you'll here the management 10 feet away asking the waitress every two seconds ""did they order yet"" after only being there for 5 minutes. The foods as good as can be expected with a diner. I'll give them that. But customer service is where its at.  If your like me and hate being rushed when eating. Dont go."
__label__5	Classic pizza joint for great N.Y style pizza. It's been ran by the same owners for years and the ingredients and flavor have not changed!
__label__4	Very good pizza. The tiramisu was excellent. When I'm in Clearwater this is where I'll eat pizza. The lasagna looked great. portion was larger than most I've seen.
__label__4	You definitely need to keep the word dive as part of the description of this place.  It is a diner and a dive, but we really enjoyed our breakfast here.  As others have mentioned, you must be comfortable being in the close proximity of your fellow man here.  It is tight.  It is a throwback atmosphere with simple basic food, done well.
__label__5	Dr Clark was a great change for me.  I recently changed to this practice due to issues with a practice at Summit.  What a big difference this has been in the level of care, professional atmosphere and overall feeling that the entire staff cares.  So far it has been a level 5 experience for me.
__label__5	"How can I not give 5 stars to a place that serves bacon fig butter? AND $1 mimosas!?

Girls weekend in SB was highlighted by brunch at the Finch & Fork - great start for our day! The food was all inventive and delicious. Extremely fresh and hearty, great before a day of wine tasting downtown. They offer a selection of mimosas to choose from, for $1 extra might as well try them all! Recommend as a must when visiting Santa Barbara."
__label__5	The AA driving school is the best! They have very experienced and patient trainers and are so accommodating! Kent, Larry, Marty and Rick are great trainers! Priscilla really helps us onboard comfortably and is so easy to approach! Highly recommended! I got my drivers license and am so confident to drive now!
__label__5	"Awesome experience and fast fix.

Had an issue with my sPen on my Note 9. It was stuck from dropping it.

Super friendly staff! Thank you!!!!!"
__label__3	My last visit to BSBH wasn't so great food-wise. The hubby and I went back for their fish fry (because it was so good in the past) and while it wasn't terrible, it was SO greasy! The fries, too, weren't as seasoned and good as I recalled. Hopefully they'll start paying attention to the food output cause the place wasn't even packed. Of course, the beer list was still up to par and the hubby was pleased.
__label__5	I love simple food done well and this place is exactly that. Admittedly, I've only ever gotten their fish tacos, but honestly they're the best I've had and are consistently delicious. The sauces they offer compliment the tacos well. I love spicy food and theirs salsas really provide that extra kick that keeps me coming back for more. Really fresh, really good food. Clean, we'll run, quick lunch. What more can you ask for?
__label__5	Being from New York, I've been in search of great pizza since I've been in Tampa.  These guys are the best I've found.  Love it!!!
__label__5	This salon is clean, and the women are friendly! Great service, beginning to end :-) I would highly recommend this salon for any hair or nail services!
__label__5	This place was great. Friendly service and the beef brisket sandwich was done just right. The homemade BBQ sauce complemented the brisket very well.. I highly recommend this place to any BBQ lovers.
__label__4	If you are in Temple Terrace and crave excellent Mexican food, you need to visit Tequila.  The homemade salsa with their tortilla chips before the main course is excellent.  The service is quick and top notch.  My wife and I have not had an unpleasant experience there in the 6-8 times there and will continue to visit.
__label__2	Ok place. Doubt I would come back. Almost a 3 star. Service nice. Way too pricy for the quality. Had a chicken burro with all the chicken lumped on one side. Drenched with weird sauce.
__label__1	"We ordered two and a half hours ago through Grubhub but never got out order. Called 4 times about our order, were told the second two times that ""it's on its way."" Finally called AGAIN a bit before they closed only to be lied to that a""manager explained to us"" that our order was cancelled because it was ""too small"". No, we were told MULTIPLE TIMES that the order we ALREADY PAID FOR was on its way! This has been the worst customer service experience I've ever had."
__label__4	Have visited this location various times for happy hour and dinner. The happy hour specials are very good 5$ classic margaritas, chicken tacos, etc. This place can be very crowded, I suggest calling ahead or booking on open table. I haven't had a good experience with table service for dinner reservations, but great experiences with the bar and bar tables. I would reccomend the happy hour, or just casual drinks and apps!
__label__5	"Bern's is THE culinary gem of the Tampa Bay area. Their beef is top quality, aged, and trimmed in house to your order (by the ounce). Sides are excellent as well. Onion soup and house salads are standard, with other vegetable a seasonal selection, some of which they grow on their own farm. They house the world's largest private wine collection and an amazing dessert room upstairs. 

Tip: Ask your server to choose an inexpensive wine to compliment your meal and they will select an appropriate or modest wine without embarrassing you."
__label__5	The mega sized pizza slice was the perfect amount of food (like 1/4 pizza) for the right price ($2.50!) Our server preternaturally knew the perfect amount of food to suit my needs. Highly satisfying, will be a repeat customer!
__label__5	"This is a very unique place, but please read the ""bad"" reviews as they accurately represent the challenges of visiting this place on a busy day. I've never seen any other place quite like this and some of the pieces are just spectacular. Some of them are ""eh"" and some are ""WTF?"" but that's art, right?  Be ready to walk a lot. I've been there twice and will definitely go again someday. Fun to bring someone who's never been."
__label__4	You could stop and eat here, but with a wet bar, billiards table, and attached liquor store it's kinda hard to think of food. They say the wings here are a force to be reckoned with and my curiosity is certainly peaked. The stiff drinks remind me of The Hub, but this has more of a sports bar feel, and is in the heart of Ybor. Return visit is in order!
__label__1	"no wonder why they only have this food chain in tucson!
way too expensive, over price!
for a footlong sub, 2 hotdogs and two popular shaved drink fo $19!
no thank you!"
__label__5	This is my favorite tortilla place in town! They also have breakfast and lunch burros , menudo, salsa, and fresh desserts. The red Chile burro is my favorite they make it really good here and it is just the perfect amount of spicy! The staff are friendly and helpful. You can dine in or take it to go. One last thing... this place is small so only two tables are available for dining in.
__label__2	Brand new customer and I will not return. Received  a okay haircut from Bill, but didn't think the quality of the cut justified the upper tier barbershop price they charge for a basic haircut. Reviews are a little misleading on here , learned from a barber they get kick backs for receiving shout outs on here. So who knows if it's customers or friends doing reviews? I having nothing against this place, but a little to pricey for me considering the quality of the haircut.
__label__5	Best food and service in airport. Tanya is the best bartender and everyone there is very friendly.
__label__1	Worst McDonald's I've ever been to in my life. Staff was rude; food was subpar. I would rather meet Jefferson Davis than talk to these people.  0/10 would not recommend.
__label__2	Very average pizza. Westshore or Tate's for regular pizza or Cappy's for Chicago is much better. Won't be back
__label__2	This hotel is out of date.  Everything was old and dirty.  It took an hour to check in.  So many drunks roaming the hallways.  Not quiet at all.  Even new caulking around the mold of the bathtub and maybe new light switch plates would have helped with look.  So expensive on a Saturday for such a dirty old room.  Staff were nice.
__label__5	"This is THEE BEST THAI FOOD ive EVER HAD!
Im from california and it tops ebery thai place ive ever went to! I gor the drunken noodles and the spring rolls!"
__label__5	Very professional! Bonnie is a dream to talk with, she is very professional and they follow all covid guidelines.
__label__3	The staff is awesome! And incredibly welcoming and friendly! However, if you're looking for Nashville Hot chicken, this is not the place. The chicken tenders were over cooked and do not deliver the flavor of Nashville Hot chicken. They are also served with sweet pickles rather than dill. There is also one dipping sauce available, which is a very mediocre, bland home sauce.
__label__1	"Very disrespectful:
https://www.edhat.com/news/landlord-verbally-assaults-isla-vista-official-on-state-street"
__label__4	I wasn't initially impressed two years ago when I tried a couple of the Baggins locations but my daughter convinced me to retry them and I have been pleasantly surprised.  The French Dip Special and the California BLT are my latest orders and I enjoyed them both so much I didn't eat any chips which is unusual for me.  I did order the Chicken Tortilla soup with the French Dip and took it home to eat later.  It was great.  Now I'm a fan.
__label__5	I made a last minute NYE reservation. Whomever booked my reservation was accommodating and although there were only outside tables available they had ample heat lamps and provided my whole party with lap blankets. Great waiter(wish I could remember his name) amazing presentation and well executed dishes from Foige gras to veggie options we tried them all. Wish we lived closer, Thanks for a memorable NYE!
__label__1	Went to Happy Hour  with a few Coworkers, Waitress brought dated Menus and left... 15 minutes later no water no nothing. Went took a few pictures (about 10mins) came back still no drinks or food, it's 5:50pm at this point. We went back to the table waiting still, 6:07pm we canceled our orders  we left Happy Hour unhappy.
__label__5	Excellent brunch place! The staff are all very friendly. The food is delicious and the decor creates the perfect setting.
__label__5	Jessica was professional, efficient and a pleasure to work with.  Quick turnaround, top quality product!
__label__1	"This moving company is a joke.  Triple my estimate and I did half the work.  I was LAPPING the movers to and from the van.  Then they ""couldn't fit"" items like chairs and box springs into new apartment....I did it by myself after they left.  Oh, and not only that but I had to pay their parking ticket. Never. Ever. Again."
__label__5	This club is kick ass. That's all I can say in short. But the long story is that the place is set up for concert style shows and they do it very well. Been looking for a place that I could go to that is pro whereby you get the feel that the owners actually give a shit about the music being played. I'm gonna go back tonight. See ya.
__label__5	My son and I stopped in after karate on Saturday to pick up a quick breakfast/brunch snack. Actually, we wanted to see the inside of this new restaurant. It was busy which was a really good sign. The food looks so good. We couldn't stay long, so we ordered cappuccino chocolate chip muffins and fruit tea. Not disappointed. Can't wait to go back to try other menu items.
__label__5	One of my most visited sushi places! It is very crowded most the times I visit, but luckily my waits are never too long. They seems to sit us down and politely help us order our meals. The atmosphere is clean and I really love the atheistic. If you want a sushi place to try out this should surely be on your list!
__label__1	This UPS store needs to be better about vetting who they rent boxes too and who they allow to use their mailing address. Allowing scammers with fake businesses to use their address is completely irresponsible.
__label__5	"I loved our Haunted French Quarter Tour. We met in Bourbon-Oh and ended up in front of Jackson Square. Our tour guide was legit, a retired Professor, not some cheesy theatrical performer like a lot of the other tours we passed. 

We got the stories behind some of the area's most haunted houses, including the LaLaurie Mansion. And yes, almost all of my pictures came out with glowing orbs in them. I sure got my money's worth here!"
__label__3	The food was good, I had the lobster mac n cheese, the service could have been better, we were searching for our waiter for quite a while.  It's a little over priced for what you get.
__label__3	All in all, I thought this place was fun to try and everything was decently good!  My group tried a few appetizers, (bacon-taquitos, potatoes wedges, bacon-shrimp, and artichokes).  Though bacon-wrapped items sound good on the surface, the bacon itself was limp and didn't complement the items they were tied to.  The potato wedges were probably the best out of the group.  Probably would not get the other appetizers again, but yes to the potatoes!!  I would add though that the service was very friendly and helpful : )!
__label__3	More like 3.5 stars.  The lady running it is wonderful- she was making sure people were out from the rain, gave everyone menus in line, talked to people.  The food was pretty good, particularly the cabbage.  The biscuit was good, too, but I didn't like how soggy it got from the debris.  The potato salad was also on point.  Overall, a nice Louisiana meal.
__label__2	Food was very dry. Service was excellent. I've had many better dining experiences in the King of Prussia area.
__label__3	Well, all I can really say is, if you like pickles and the flavor of dill in your food, this is the place to go. Everything was ok, nice presentation, clean restaurant, attentive wait staff. Just for some reason, everything we ordered seemed to taste like pickles. The hummus, felafel wrap and tabbouleh. The beef shwarma wrap was sweet and not what I was expecting.
__label__5	This is a very big and fairly new store that did have a 12 package of Tissue paper. Finally a store with some. LOL
__label__4	tried the bagel, egg and cheese and was definitely impressed. I'm a long way from home, NY, but this tastes like a Northeasterners breakfast bagel sandwich...real fried egg, extra helping of cheese, and toasted bagel. Will go back again and again, perhaps this weekend!
__label__5	"Best pizza growing up, best pizza place still. 
Ask for the old way or a pizzaz with hots. Love them!
Everything on their menu is wonderful. Clean, polite family owned"
__label__4	"If you can get past the au-natural smell of fresh oysters, and the ""Kenny Rogers Roasters"" neon lights, this seems a must-stop for a visit to Nawlins.  First time having ""chargrilled"" oysters, and it was heavenly.  Try not to slurp one down while the butter is still boiling though!"
__label__1	"Hey everybody, want to come to a 'hip new' place where you can both be insulted by the prices and the management personally?  Well then come on down to The Cellar Door - where poor service and inattention will earn you catcalls questioning whether or not you are a 'Real' New Orleanian and remarks that they will just eat your food when you leave! 

...which no doubt will be cold and mediocre (though I'm sure thoroughly curated). 

Thanks for playing, y'all! 

Enjoy your clubhouse while it lasts."
__label__4	"As far as convenience stores go, Wawa has it all. This particular location is fairly new, clean and modern. It's very spacious and well designed to accommodate the busy morning coffee rush and lunch crowd. 

My daughter ordered Mac and cheese and I ordered a latte. I don't really like wawa coffee but the latte is decent (it's no SBX, but works in a pinch).

We were in and out within minutes and the  cashier was nice and overall experience was pleasant & efficient."
__label__4	"Don't make this your life changing destination and it can be a really good time.

 I think the two distinct bars are a really big plus. If you prefer laid back conversation and just hanging out stay up front. If you want a more suburbia club atmosphere, are a smoker or want to dance then hit the back bar. 

The drinks are reasonably priced, made well and they have some craft beer on tap. 

Kids, it is not going to get any better than this in Marcus Hook so enjoy it."
__label__4	The bacon egg biscuit was delicious, but docking a star because my bacon was a little bit burnt. Although they may have intended it this way, but I just didn't like it as much. The biscuit was great, it held up with every bite and didn't crumble like some other places. The only thing I felt the sandwich was missing was a bit of sweetness. I added some honey when I got home and it tasted so much better. Great place to grab a quick breakfast sandwich, but it is pricey though, I would probably come here again if I crave it.
__label__5	They have the best breakfast. We ate there early afternoon today and you have to eat the breakfast which is available all day. Not all WH are they same but this one was good. Our waitress Was Danny and she was pleasant and quick. The food was good and reasonably priced. There are no bells and whistles just good food properly served. This WH certainly measured up.
__label__5	Stellar food. The best BBQ pork steaks in St Louis! Baked beans are equally awesome, flavorful, and definitely not from a can. Attentive but not obtrusive service. Great atmosphere.
__label__3	this is really a 3 1/2 stars.just moved to this nieghborhood. havent found the best pizza yet. tried this place because its a couple blocks away and i had to walk the dog anyway. they were really friendly. pizza was made quickly. as far as the pizza goes. pretty good.not too much or too little of anything. i prefer a thinner crust kind. but it was still yum. i will def go again. and try other stuff on the menu. little disappointing. no pepsi.
__label__5	Tasty place and they do something most restaurants try to avoid--sell small portions of single items.  If you just need a small bit of tri-tip, no sandwich or sides or anything, they'll sell it to you.  The inside is nice, though a little weird with all the security cameras, but the food is consistent and tasty.  I don't eat meat, but every one I'm gone with has said it is a bit dry, pretty tasty, and certainly worth the money.
__label__5	if you're unwell, you're going to want to come here. best service all around I've ever seen. seriously
__label__5	Great spot for breakfast. Best breakfast burritos! The beignets were great, comparable to cafe du monde.
__label__5	Great beers, great deal! The area for tasting is small, but a relaxed atmosphere and friendly staff make up for it! Four beers for just a dollar. We didn't get a tour (wish they were run more frequently). Great place ~ took home some fantastic beers.
__label__3	I ordered a cake for my sisters birthday. We are from Philadelphia staying in New Orleans for a few days. Our cake was suppose to be delivered between 11:30 -1:30 we didn't receive the cake till 2:30 I was very upset since we had a planned schedule. The cake was pretty I like how they did it but it was so sweet and to much frosting
__label__4	Yum! Came here a couple of times for lunch, and I left happy. I had a wonderful croissant, giant salad and some really good coffee. The pasta dish I had on a subsequent visit was equally impressive, and the bread was soft and fresh - good lunch specials, too. A great option for a quick lunch downtown - I'll be back!
__label__1	Horrible horrible horrible customer service. Takes forever!Employees are very rude . Extremely disrespectful . Def a place where you don't want to take your children . Don't even inquire anything because it's an issue. ATTITUDE for everything. General Manager doesn't care too busy trying to be best buds with employees. This location needs to be retrained esp the managers. All the good employees have moved on I've noticed . I'm contacting owner for this issue I have so if your read this, message! Thank you
__label__5	My dog goes to daycare here almost every day and he loves it! All the staff knows him by name and he has had the opportunity to make true friends that he looks forward to see every day! Healthy socializing and fun play time! Will always support this awesome business!
__label__1	The worst place I been in to the manger skinny black shirt  girl that work this morning doesn't know how to deal was custmer that go all over been very rude for trying to get refill cus I want outside to get something from my car I really didn't want to deal with her but she is mess top not place that ppl. Can feel home like other location
__label__1	This hole in the wall takeout place is the only Chinese food in Doylestown right now or else they'd be out of business. I've tried this place 3 times now and it's never been very good, but this last time was just horrible. The pad tai was tasteless and just so bad. I had a $75 order and it is the cheapest, most tasteless, low quality way to make each dish. I threw out whatever wasn't eaten. I wouldn't feed this food to a dog. Shame on you Great Wall!
__label__2	I ate here and I ordered the rib eye and my wife ordered the ny strip. The steaks were ok not nearly the best very tough but had a lot of juice. First time eating there but I do not think I will be going back
__label__1	"1.  It is nearly impossible to make a same-day appointment.

2.  If you call later in the day, they will tell you to call back at 9am.

3.  When you call back at 9am, you will be put on hold for a long period of time (15+ minutes, probably because everyone else was told to call back at 9am)

This is a problem if you have a job that requires you to be WORKING at 9am.

Honestly, it was easier for me to get tickets to the 2008 World Series than it is for me to make an appointment at Jefferson."
__label__5	"Not a professional food taster, I am just a casual.

Though for the price, I believe you can get the biggest bang for your buck in this restaurant.  For 7 dollars, you get a huge burrito, and you will be full for the rest of the night.  If you have to eat on a budget and still want to eat good.  This is the best place.  

Don't forget they also offer free nachos, with infinite refill."
__label__5	Great food and a great place just to sit down with the family. Service is good and the food is fast. Plenty of seating for groups or parties and outdoor seating is available. Over all it's a restaurant you don't want to skip
__label__5	I've been seeing Dr Nicole since they opened 10 years ago. Making appointments is easy and front desk staff is always kind. Nicole always gets me feeling better when I walk out the door. She even made a home visit after the birth of my son. Highly recommend!
__label__3	Friendly staff, good quality lobster but poor portion size for the money. I spent $20 on the lobster roll that I ate in 3 bites. Smallest sandwich I've ever eaten. And for that reason I don't see myself going back
__label__5	The chicken tacos are literally to die for. The service is so amazing. The girls are very nice.  The tacos saved my life. GET THE CHICKEN TACOS!!!!
__label__1	"Do not support this harassing jerk.  We attempted to go here today.  While my fiancé was in the bathroom I went to get a table.  The place was half full and suddenly the owner was telling her to get the f@#k out for no reason.  I asked why he would treat a woman like that?!  He ranted about not caring what ppl think of him or what we would write on Yelp or Facebook.  
He clearly was having a moment and can't handle running a business with quality customer service.  We left and should have called the police.  

Do not support this jerk."
__label__5	Not only the best BBQ in Largo but stopping by to dine or pick up is always a great atmosphere. Naomi, Kayla, and Kellie are the MVPs and go out of their way to make a small interaction so friendly and positive. Great energy to be around. This is what makes us come back!
__label__5	Great bar and off the French Quarter path. Love the atmosphere and the drinks are to die for! We tried many of the craft drinks and they were are fantastic! Remarkable Gin Fizz and another great drink with grapefruit...can't recall the name....but tasty! Very knowledgable bartenders! Grab a small bite plate too! Great cheese and olives! We will be back again and make this one to hit in our trip each time! See you soon!
__label__5	Love the homey feeling I get when I walk in! The service was great the girls at the counter were extremely friendly! I got the quiche, roasted potatoes and fresh fruit and it was all big portions and fresh! The case of dessert look even more incredible! Also love the fact that they have bottomless coffee for a fabulous price!
__label__5	Fabulous experience.  Walked on for nails and they are beautiful.   Great staff.  Will cone back
__label__5	"Just brought a visiting friend and his colleague for lunch and we split 2 large shrimp, 1 large oyster and a small roast beef. The shrimp was right on, as usual, the oyster was good. I couldn't partake in the roast beef (too full). As I told my friend, I remember the bartender and Ms. Dottie as far back as when I first started going there in the late 70's, when I was a teenager .
They simply have the best shrimp po-boys in town."
__label__5	Love this place ! Great food . I go at least once a month for their lunch buffet. Saturday's are great to go , it's never packed.
__label__4	"My wife and I love to frequent Johnny Brenda's. The outdoor seating in the spring and summer months is a must.
The food never disappoints. In fact, their cuban sandwich is the best I've had in Philly. The beers are all local draughts. The interior is inviting and the service is friendly. 
I haven't seen a show yet, but I'd recommend the Sunday gospel brunch.
Of course I'll be back."
__label__2	Customer service was horrible. Waitress seemed annoyed, not sure why? We came in at 2pm and there literally was no one else in the restaurant. Food was good, I wouldn't recommend the creole potato it was extremely cheesy, almost overwhelming on top of the loaded cream. The oysters were delicious.
__label__5	"The BEST Taco Time location (but all locations in Boise are awesome) This place is always spotless, super friendly and courteous staff, and 100% quality food every time.  Taco Hell should mystery shop Taco Time so they could get a clue about what a well run franchise should be providing the public  

(Note: don't do it Taco Hell, just close down and do us all a favor!)"
__label__1	I had my kids here and the experience has not been the most pleasant one. Teachers don't last more than a couple months so the little ones have to be constantly adjusting to new teachers. When they leave you rarely get a notice indicating a new teachers. The facilities are not the cleanest. To top all the less than great service there price is one of the highest on the main line. Do your research people.
__label__3	Tattooed Mom has a great selection of beers. My first and favorite of the beers they have, was the Peanut Butter Beer. It was delicious and well crafted. It reminded me of coffee sort of but in the form of beer. It's dark and the fizz has the texture of heated skim milk. I didn't bother trying the food, but I bet its great. I can't wait to try other selections and it's hard not to. The happy hour special is till 7 pm and the beers are around 2.50.
__label__5	"I went to Martin's a few years back for some fried catfish and don't remember being impressed. I'm happy to say I returned this weekend and loved every bite of food I had. The sauces are all delicious, the catfish was crispy and perfectly made, and the side dishes were delicious. My boyfriend had pulled pork and brisket: both were amazing. 

Don't hesitate to visit Martin's while you're in Nashville!"
__label__5	Had a fantastic dinner experience at the Atlantis Steakhouse. Not only was the food excellent, but our main waiter, Chad, provided a wonderful service!! It's been a while since I've experienced such a fun and friendly service.  I highly recommend this restaurant. Looking forward to our next visit.
__label__1	Horrible pizza...very disappointed! New in the area for work, had to find something quick and easy. Was quick, but got back to the office and very upset, it is cardboard with a sorry excuse of greasy cheese. Now i will have to pay more money for something to be delivered from somewhere else. I shoud've looked at the reviews first.
__label__5	Tour was great from start to finish. Our guide Rich was a certified historian of the area and led a great tour. It was so hot that day the afternoon session was cancelled and Rich made sure to always talk in a shaded area and plan for a AC break in the middle of the tour. Would highly recommend to anyone including families with small children.
__label__5	Amazing place! I ordered the Little Cuban and was very impressed. I did ask for the Cuban sauce drizzle on the side because on the menu it didn't describe what the sauce was and I didn't know if I would like it but I definitely did! (it was tangy, had a slight spice and vinegar taste to it) I would recommend this pizza and this restaurant to everyone and anyone.
__label__5	This was my first visit to the salon. I got a Keratin treatment done on my hair and I just washed it. WOW! I normally have to straighten my hair due to the natural wave and frizz, but not today! I just blow dried it and was good to go to work! Very pleased with my experience and would definitely recommend and return.
__label__5	I picked up a few smoothies on the way to see my girlfriend & her friend at work. When I hit that hard right to turn into the parking lot.. all of our smoothies fell over lmao bc I almost passed the parking lot but it's okay no need to be alarmed!! mine was the one rolling around on the floor board until I was able to park but they still look good as spanking new. I rate smoothie king 5 out of 5 for securing their lids on so tight
__label__2	If i didnt happen to live by a stop on the EL, septa would only get one star. why are there only two subway routes in center city? why are tokens not sold at every location? why can't we have a pass that holds whatever amount of money we put on it and does not expire? why cant customer service offer any help at all? why must i smell pee everywhere? philly could really use a good public transit if we are ever going to battle gas prices.
__label__1	Absolutely the worst service ever.  They keep you on hold forever. They pretend to take your order and don't. You are waiting for a pizza that never arrives.  They should be ashamed of themselves.
__label__4	Decent. i been a few times i was upset they didn't have the blue cheese macaroni on the menu anymore. but the crab claws are the best a must have when you go! everything is alway pretty good and the customer service is good as well.
__label__1	Their call center made me an emergency appointment as a new patient for the next day. On my way to my appointment  I was notified that they don't take new appointments on the weekend and because it was a holiday weekend ni could bee seen for a pay upfront extra charge but no work would be done. I could have gone in to a different dentist today and gotten my tooth fixed in time for a wedding I'm in next weekend if I had known that when I made the appointment . Horrible customer service.
__label__5	Been eating there many years. Great servings and food. No pictures because we ate it all. We are as full as pho.
__label__1	"This veterinary hospital is a rip off!!! 149.00 to clip the nails of a 6 week old kitten and an exam that included; NOTHING!!! No SNAP test, no deworming, no shots, no vaccines. 60.00 for a non-emergency, 66.50 for an ""exam"", and 22.50 to clip nails. Go elsewhere!!"
__label__1	I wouldn't go back for the coffee. Previous experience for breakfast several years ago was positive. But this was memorable for overly expensive takeout coffee, the small size was more like a shot glass, luke warm, asked to replace and it came back with a bunch of grinds at the bottom. Disappointing.
__label__5	"Kristine took my group on a ""custom"" tour of the lower ninth ward.  She was extremely knowledgeable and savvy about the area, as well as the deep history of this neighborhood.  She knew exactly where to go and what to see in our time frame.    The bikes were in great shape and the prices are very reasonable.  I would recommend Crescent City for any occasion and I look forward to getting back to New Orleans, as well as my next bike adventure!  Thank you again Kristine!"
__label__5	Wow. I came here when it first opened. They have done some amazing work to the museum. It puts an incredibly somber tone on the events of World War 2. Fantastic museum.
__label__1	Do you have to smother everything with bbq sauce and hot sauce? You burn all the food and overcook the rest. Nobody from this neighborhood takes pride in anything they do. They just wanna get paid and throw their chicken bones all over so my dog chokes on them.
__label__5	The space is small, but clean and has a variety of workout equipment that does not usually have a wait.
__label__2	"Went in to have dessert & a couple nice  scotches.  Bartender pours us each a drink & after we each have a sip she says ""i accidentally gave you a 2 oz pour instead of the 1 oz for the price listed, is that OK?"". I've never had a bartender do that. What if we said no?  Needless to say our dessert bill was double what we expected.  Your tip was based on that.
Snickers dessert was delicious and we enjoyed the scotch...only reason for 2 stars."
__label__5	"Omg!!! I walked in and felt like I was back in Korea. As previously stated it's not like your typical bakery. However, you will find the tastiest Korean naked goods in town. 
Come and take a sit, chill and have pastry with a tea or coffee. 
Wonderful relaxed atmosphere with great service."
__label__4	After having been treated to SPY by Yelp, I returned here to see Poltergiest, the re-boot with my old friend and his partner. I was pleased with the movie, and happy to see that the theater was large and comfortable. The snacks were well provided for and they even use the new coke machines.
__label__5	"They have a buffet on Sunday's that comes with dessert and chef made Bananas Fosters.  The buffet price and selection were great and the food was perfect for small kids as well.  Keep in mind that they close at 3pm on Sunday.  We drive for 40 mins to get here, that is how much we like the food.

The owners are very nice and hard working.  If you are in the area or even just looking for a new place to try, this restaurant is worth the drive."
__label__2	Place is not bad however it's gone down hill and there are much better Mexican places in the city to eat. Had dinner recently and my order was not correct although the waiter was very good about making it so. They sell $11 margaritas but don't have margarita glasses and the glasses that you get are ridiculously small probably less than 3 ounces. I looked at my check and I was charged $2.50 for a glass of seltzer water. Won't be returning anytime soon and I have been a very loyal customer. Go to Blue Corn.
__label__5	These burgers are phenomenal!  That, coupled with the wonderful owner and excellent service, will keep us coming back!
__label__4	This is a great BYOB with cheap food. My favorite is their lemongrass seafood noodle soup. I asked them to make it extra spicy last time I went, and they definitely delivered on their promise. I've also had the pad thai which was tasty, but I found it a little greasy. The great thing about this place is that their menu is so extensive that it pleases everyone. And the fact that there's a wine and spirits store a few blocks away...
__label__5	Awesome bahn mi. I get my drinks half sweet which is still pretty sweet. Coffee jelly and lychee jelly has a great chewy texture. So good I've been there twice this week...so far.
__label__5	Tamara was so prompt and helpful.  She helped us with our business and personal taxes.  Communication was great, we did everything remotely and it was simple and straight forward.  I'll never do our taxes again myself, and I'm looking forward to next year when we get to chat with Tamara again.  I recommend her to everyone!
__label__5	amazing pizza. all the pizzas are great, but if you want a recommendation to try something you might not otherwise... get the meatball!
__label__5	jessica makes the best coffee in tampa not only is she the owner but my friend tooo
__label__5	the place to be to get pho. place is often pack with hungry customers. if you come here you'll know why. not very big so seating is a factor but its worth the wait.
__label__1	Gel Manicure started peeling off after 6 days!! Place was cute inside and staff was very friendly with very reasonable price ($25 for gel) however if they don't last it's not worth it in my opinion.
__label__4	Massive rooms gorgeous views the only problem is there's sales tax in tourist tax when you checkout make sure to get to the Club Lounge floor to get free soda water and cookies and anything else except for alcohol for free I stayed two days.  Foosball tournaments and beautiful black and white gatherings.  in west port village.  full of restaurants and night life and live bands
__label__5	Last week I was directed to a quality coffee shop and Quill made the grade. My cappuccino was so foamy I enjoyed it with a spoon. Quill has open spaces with couches, small tables and a few rooms for private conversations. It was raining. I took time to savor the moments. Maybe I'll have to do this again.
__label__5	"I need to amend my previous review.  I have been there twice since I wrote my previous review and the atmosphere seems to have changed.  Much more accommodating, much more friendly and concerned that you are enjoying your meal.  Still the hard sell on fries, drinks and brownies but the sandwiches are very good, so who cares?  You can just say "" no thank you"" if you don't want any and good for you if you do!"
__label__4	Great food and fun place with amazing atmosphere! Lost a star because service was terrible!!! Rude and stuck up wait staff!!
__label__3	Loved the band they had the night I stopped in here with friends, we danced so much!
__label__5	Let tell you how much I love a movie theater that delivers food right to your seat. The delivery didn't disrupt the movie for myself and others close by either. Pretty dope
__label__3	Zoe's is decent.  It's good if you're looking for a quick meal and something different from Panera or Chipotle.  It's mediterranean so think hummus and grilled chicken.
__label__4	Very good pizza ... Not the best I've ever had, but very good. Salads were tasty and the mozzarella sticks hit the spot!
__label__5	"Five stars for Branded Screen Printing! I've worked with them on 3 jobs now, and will continue to use them as my ""go-to"" printing source. Their designer is fantastic - super creative and spot-on with my ideas. Top-shelf customer service and communication (Sara is great!). Reasonable prices and fast turn-around. I highly recommend this locally owned business!"
__label__5	I've always loved Bluebeard, but I found an even higher appreciation for them during the COVID-19 pandemic. They did a phenomenal job turning their outdoor space into an outdoor kitchen and bar. I loved walking by, grabbing a pizza or BBQ from their smoker, and continuing on. They're so flexible with the times. The food is ever evolving and so is the restaurant.
__label__4	"El Vez is fantastic, I have never been let down by this amazing restaurant. I went here with buddy of mine as we crashed his roommates date. The margaritas were wonderful and the Guac hit the spot like no other restaurant in the city.
As for dinner I had the chicken fajita that blew my mind. The chicken was grilled to perfection and was cooked how i like it. I would come back to this place any time, that i could afford it that is lol!"
__label__1	45 minutes later and I'm still waiting on my food. I've watched 3 other customers come in order, get their food and leave. I had a small order so it's not like I ordered something large or extremely difficult. I will not be returning nor will I recommend this place to anyone. If I could leave 0 stars I would.
__label__5	Tinas is. Amazing.   The only place that'll do my nails from now on.  They were able to squeeze us in a very busy night and save the birthday party from total ruined.  The rates are very reasonable and the service is second to none
__label__5	Great small 'hole in the wall' place. Huge portions that are delicious. The service is really great. I definitely recommend this place to anyone. Very good prices too!
__label__5	"Great food. Great service. The grilled octopus was perfectly done and came with a little salad. Next time that will be meal. Gnocchi was also perfectly prepared but too much for me. I have had the pear sacchetti previously & it's also delicious. I forgot my purse and when we went back to get it, they were very kind & told me ""it happens all the time "" so I wouldn't feel like an old-timer. 
Back a week later after picking up the truck. Great food. Great service."
__label__2	Very cute atmosphere, albeit very small and extremely warm.   Delicious salad but very disappointed with short rib pappardelle.   Tomato sauce completely ruined the dish.  Pork chop was very moist and flavorful, but again disappointed with the sauce.   So many other restaurants to try, no need to come back again.
__label__1	Had the BBQ chicken quesadilla for lunch today, and now I have a bad stomachache!!!! My first lunch and my last at this place!
__label__4	Good is good. Love the ouster puff pastries! Perfect location, convenient for after drinking.
__label__4	I picked up my new glasses day before yesterday and after the guy put them on my face I told him I would probably be back to have them fitted again. So I went by there this evening and there was a girl there that I had not seen before but she seems to have done a really fine job as my glasses are not sliding down my nose at this point.
__label__5	Was here w/ a bunch of great friends, service was timely accurate, very very delicious.  Servers were great, courteous, helpful foods YUM....very amazingly
__label__4	Good place to grab a quick meal. I really love their Kung Pao chicken. However it's sad they removed pot stickers from the menu.
__label__5	"Love this Hong Kong style ""Cha Chan Teng"" cafe! Tried the macaroni with spam and egg which comes with hk style milk tea. It's tasty, the milk tea is authentic and the price is very affordable too. I also got the pork belly rice to go and it blew me away! The pork was so delicious and tender. Would definitely come back!"
__label__5	I've completed both rooms and both were great. Brian was extremely helpful, entertaining, and provided a great escape room experience. Five stars!
__label__5	I've been to Brio a number of times. We took my sister for her birthday. There were seven of us. The food was awesome, the service was excellent, and everything went well. Great atmosphere.
__label__3	I didn't snap a pic but the drive thru service is fast and friendly. The prices seem to be in line with the competitors but the custard is just ok. Certainly not the best but far from the worst
__label__5	Great atmosphere, great for brunch, dinner, great wines and fun food. Would definitely recommend. Patio is great when weather allows. Looking forward to going back soon! Love the wine and cheese pairing!
__label__3	"It seems like sacrilege, even to me, but this place jumped the shark years ago.  It's burgers are nowhere close to where they used to be (remember that phenomenal charcoal crust?).  They still make some of the best fries around though.  Service is inconsistent, and highly dependent upon your waiter/waitress instead of the kitchen.

It's still a fun visit, and a requisite on the list to take out of town visitors, but those visitors are no longer likely to leave with memories of the incredible food, just the experience."
__label__4	My family and I thoroughly enjoyed our Diablo Burgers and fries. The ingredients were super fresh. The beef was exquisite. The fries were some of the best I've ever had.   The homemade ketchup was unique and a great compliment to the fries. You can't go wrong at Diablo Burgers.
__label__1	This is the worst nail salon.  The staff and management are incredibly rude in addition to not doing nails well.  I went there in December before an event with a very specific manicure in mind.  I got a loose variation of what I asked for and when I tried to tell them it wasn't how I wanted it I was told it looked good.  I left unhappy and without enough time to get my nails re-done.
__label__5	Just had a wonderful and very reasonable priced facial with Kelly.  Really enjoyed it and she was very thorough.  Additionally, the facility was extremely clean - which I am very picky about.  Highly recommend.
__label__1	Just went in to fix a tire leak took 45 minutes and thirty dollars the place I go to usually takes 15 minutes and 10 dollars
__label__5	Took my hellcat through there all the time never had a problem......And you get a free vacuum. People love to bitch. It's twenty bucks a month what the hell is the problem. There are none.
__label__1	I was not happy with our fries, it was dry and cold. Our burger the bun was cold and soggy because they put to much sauce in it.  We are so disappointed in our food. We thought since we had an awesome experience eating Shake Shack for the first time at Hudson Yard in New York and then we got back home to Philadelphia and so excited that we have one nearby our place that is new and thought it was going to be as good as the first one we ate, but it wasn't.  It's eatable but not that incredible.
__label__2	The wait staff was courteous and polite but we did not enjoy the quality of the food. The food that we ate (nachos with guac, carne asada fajitas and chicken taco) were all overly seasoned with pepper and very bland. We did not have any drinks so we can't speak to that.
__label__2	Staff  has  ATTITUDE  problems. Asked for a bag for my 4 pizzas and a salad counterman Matt rolled his eyes and said no. When its 15 degrees outside I like a bag. This was our second and last  visit. Yuppie food at Yuppie prices. Robert  H.

__label__3	"This is absolutely a no frills neighborhood bar that caters to locals.  They have a pool table, dart board and video poker.

Once or twice a month they have a live band.  Open 24 hours for your drinking pleasure."
__label__5	Best bagels in the area, in fact, the only REAL BAGELS that I know of in the Philly area! I'm a NY Jew, so I have very high standards when it comes to bagels. 'Nuff said!
__label__1	"Ordered Udon Noodles and Beef to go when I got Home I had Udon Noodles and Shrimp.  So my 1st Experience was less than good.  

I also found it expensive for the serving size...

Probably won't go back and I like supporting our Small Local Businesses in our Community

__label__5	"Ask for Caitlyn when you go in. She's the small blonde server in the bar area. She seems to know what's going on. The guy that she had with her didn't seem to to know anything. Dione I believe. He seemed pretty intoxicated at one point, coming up to us slurring his words very bad. Caitlyn made sure we had a great time even though she was held back by her ""teammate""."
__label__5	BEST JIMMY JOHN'S! They are always super friendly and super quick when preparing my orders!! By the time I'm done ordering, they're already finished making my sandwich! Talk about quick service!!!
__label__5	One of the few places in Edmonton that can satisfy my hunger! Clean, delicious and fast! I love this restaurant!
__label__5	"When shopping at Raleys at Mccarran and Caughlin Ranch today, I was pleasantly surprised that the signage in the aisles had been changed to black with white lettering. It is now totally readable from the end of any aisle. Woo hoo! 

Kudos to the Raley's team for being so quickly responsive to a customer suggestion. One does not  find such instant responses in the business world to customer recommendations these days. Thank you Raleys Team. I appreciate you!"
__label__2	"For the app, we Hummus - it was good but too much EVOO

Calamari Caesar salad was OK- definitely not worth the $30some for the 2 of us. Tons of calamari and some lettuce..nothing special. 

Salad was ordered with dressing on the side...but came out covered in dressing.

Wouldn't go back."
__label__3	BBQ is pretty good, as are the sides.  It's pretty much all meat and heavy stuff, as you might imagine.  Staff and service are a little spotty.
__label__3	The products are great.  We get our milk here every week, the grilled cheese is incredible and the ice cream is delicious. The reason for three stars is that there is never enough staff.  This results in a long wait, dirty tables and over full garbage cans.  Saturday night at 8:00 pm and a quarter of the flavors of ice cream are not available. The staff is very nice, however it is all teenagers and there is no sense of urgency. More staff and management supervision and it's five stars!
__label__5	Omg omg omg! This place is so good. Their original chicken sandwich is delicious. I'm excited to try everything on the menu. I got the potato pancakes (yum) and the regular chicken sandwich. I see a lot of people who complained about the price, but honestly it's the same size as a Chik-fil-a sandwich and WAY better. I think it's worth the price. My chicken was juicy, the slaw tasted fresh, and the Hawaiian bun perfectly complimented the chicken.
__label__3	College town wings. A lot of students both come and work. Good wings, but I prefer my wings to be fall off the bone. These wings definitely have a crunch to them. If that is your type of wing, this is the place for you!
__label__1	"This will be my last time using this car wash. I put $10 into one of the self wash machines which gave me 16 minutes to wash my car. Unfortunately I spent half that time waiting for the equipment to work.

$27 later I am leaving with a visibly still dirty truck as the foam soap brush did absolutely nothing. Don't waste your time or money on this place. Rain provides a better Carwash"
__label__5	I went there for lunch on a weekday, I had the barracuda bowl. I also have chips and salsa. The barracuda bowl is a ton of food for very Little cost. The pork was very yummy, tasted fresh, and flavored to perfection. It also comes in a edible taco shell shaped into a bowl. The staff were very nice and accommodating. I was forced to leave a good tip.
__label__1	When returning items, you don't receive any emails letting you know it's on its way, they received it, your refund is on its way...nothing. It's been almost 3 weeks and not a word.   also, I prefer a place that has free shipping and at least free shipping on refunds.  Will not order from there again.
__label__2	We tried the Veal Saltimbocca and the Calamari Marinara, with a Campanella's Special pizza for the road.  We were pretty disappointed here as both main dishes were very bland.  The Veal wasn't tough, but it wasn't all that tender, either.  The service, while friendly, was slow and there was only one other table occupied in the entire restaurant.  Sorry, but the Terminator won't be back this time.
__label__4	The Saturday brunch special was a delicious portobello quiche. It came with a sizable salad for only $8. Wow, that's a good value. The beer selection is excellent. Decent pub fare overall. Nice service.
__label__3	The place was dated, the bartender was also our server but he hustled the best he could. Food took a while to come out (45 minutes for entrees). Which is perplexing bc I saw a max of 6 tables occupied. Food was good. Expensive for jambalaya and some pasta and shrimp $28/ea. Probably won't be back.
__label__5	Bob was a champion sales rep. within the VW group.  Honest on every point with the best deal one could hope for, and even by the time I got to the final finance review everything added up exactly as agreed. On top of the great deal, the trade in was very fair on my air condition-less older Hyundai.  Very pleasant compared to my prior experiences. And the VW Passat blows the doors off of the other options in this price range.
__label__2	"I have an important piece of news for locals considering coming here. There is no dock. Move on. 

Tourists, feel free to come on in. They will move the ocean here soon just for you."
__label__2	I went here over Labor Day weekend. Got there Saturday morning, was 4th or 5th person in line. The place was not packed. Decor is hip, open breezy, laid back vibe. The food looked great, but we already had plans for food somewhere else, just needed coffee. Ordered 4 coffees, the vanilla bourbon and whisky caramel. I kid you not, I waited 45 min for those 4 damn coffees. They were ok, but not worth the price or wait.
__label__2	We've visited twice, and had less than stellar service each time. The wait staff was nice enough, but we felt like we were bothering them. They returned once to ask if we needed anything, and had we known, we would have asked for the refill on drinks that we never received. The place wasn't even busy the last visit, and we still waited a very long time for our food. Will not likely be returning.
__label__1	Come on Walgreens, you can do better. I will not be recommending you going forward. I got a drive through test in June for for my daughter who needed it for a trip. The results were there first thing next morning. Great experience and I'm thinking it must have been a different lab doing the testing at the time. I didn't think twice about using them again when my younger daughter was exposed at school last week. She cannot go back without a negative test and we have been waiting days now for the results.
__label__5	Must stop if you like Boba. My daughter was craving Boba and we decided to try out Youmi in Broad Ripple. We were treated with a smile and my daughter really enjoyed her strawberry/banana go go ice with traditional Boba.
__label__5	"Milo needed a haircut for the season  
The staff was very friendly and patient even though he was barking and nervous. He finished up early and his cut looked great! We are ready for the warm weather!"
__label__4	This place is great - perfect for when you don't want fast food...but you want your food fast! The meat is all cooked to perfection. Pita is soft and fluffy. It's not cheap, though - but you do get what you pay for!
__label__4	Ombré done by Andy. Loved the way my nails turned out! Andy definitely takes his time to do a good job. He really listened to what I wanted and made sure I liked them before he went on to finish them. Ombré cost $60, a little pricier than I expected but Andy did an exceptional job.
__label__5	This place is always packed, that's how you know it's good! We usually get take out. Fresh rolls are a must!
__label__5	"If you need a hospital grade pump, consider Then Comes Baby! If you need to pump around the clock for your Little One you will need to have this unit as it has more horsepower.  While you may also have a ""Symphony"" at home, it is not the same thing. Sabrina (or your Lactation consultants) will also explain this to you.

The rental rate is much more palatable than what is offered at many hospitals.

Once again Then Comes Baby exceeds my expectations!"
__label__5	Love this place!!!  'We've been there a couple of times.  The decor, food & people make it all an enjoyable experience.  We live 200 miles from St. Charles & will be returning to the Mother In Law House for sure.
__label__3	I've been there several times.  Service is...wait for it...wait for it...slow.  If you are not in a hurry or thirsty or hungry this is fine.  However, you will wait for drinks.  The place isn't overly cozy either there are lots of drafts.  Decor is fairly industrial.  The food is pretty good but again, you better not be in a hurry.
__label__5	Dr Dan and Megan are amazing. They have a big heart to serve and are constantly looking for ways to share with people how to be healthier naturally. They host lots of community events, provide great workshops and really care about providing great affordavle care for the family!
__label__4	"You must go here now!  Seriously, what are you waiting for?  A great spot for breakfast.  What a fantastic selection of different type of breakfast styles.  They have great home fries with tasty grilled onions included if you so desire.  The staff is friendly and accommodating to special requests in food prep like ""pile on the bacon and sausage in my breakfast sandwich."""
__label__2	Maybe it's because I'm not from STL but, I was not impressed at all with Imo's Pizza. We ordered a cheese pizza and pepperoni/sausage pizza. The crust was too thin and the cheese was a little waxy. I'm pretty sure we would've been better off ordering Pizza Hut.
__label__4	Although they don't greet you when you get there, the service overall is great. Nice hidden spot by the aquarium with good food and we'll kept atmosphere. Kid friendly during the day. Teriyaki chicken salad was good.
__label__4	got nachos and the tostitos and guac for lunch recently.  mmm, mmm good!  the grilled cheese looks killer, but a little pricey for 2 pieces of bread and some melted cheese....
__label__1	Why does the food have to be so good & such terrible service ! When I first walked in, the host completely ignored me talking to her. Then we sit down & our server takes my fiancés order and I wasn't ready yet. He gets his food and then she completely forgot about me. Walked passed me like 6 times. My food came out a half our later than his. Also I order chicken & cheese and asked for the cheese on my mash potatoes and she looks at me like I'm stupid & then is rude about it. TERRIBLE SERVER. Her name was Ashley.
__label__5	I get my hair styled by Tommy and he always has amazing ideas for new and fun styles. He always executes them flawlessly and is so open to feedback. He did amazing color and then I stopped by so he could curl it and take a picture and Andreas ended up taking some portraits in the studio. They make every client feel like family. If you want fresh and long lasting color, go to Tommy! I'm so impressed by his fun-loving attitude, yet extreme professionalism when it's time to work. He takes his craft very seriously.
__label__5	"Tim Trone.   Salesman
I haven't purchased a car in forty years without using a broker.  Hated the process and wasn't looking forward to being harassed and hassled by car dealers.  I met Tim at Autonation Honda and he made the whole experience very pleasant.  Great guy and very helpful during the whole process.  Even gave me a ride to pick up the car.  No pressure, no hassle, easy deal.  If you're looking for a Honda, go out of your way to find Tim.  You'll like him and the way he treats people.  Great experience."
__label__2	The first time I went I was impressed by the service, food, beer and ambiance. I went back a week later and had a completely different experience. The Pretzel Nugs were very hard (to the point where I literally couldn't eat them), our service was mediocre at best and manager working behind the bar was beyond rude. As much as I love to support local places, I don't know that I'll go back.
__label__4	The food took a little bit to get to us but all in all an above average bbq place. The food was well seasoned and my boyfriend raved about his burger. It's not pricey either. The best things we have were the sweet potato fries. They must have been batter dipped because they were so crispy. Love love love. The mac and cheese was different in appearance (looked kind of odd) but still yummy.
__label__1	The worst experience I've ever had at a fast food restaurant. Was treated like I was dirt. Will never ever come back again. Beyond awful. The person who helped me was named Tanyla, refused to tell me my total or give me the proper order.
__label__5	Have been here a few times and I have nothing but good things to say about Audrey Claire. First off, the waiters/waitresses are super knowledgeable and personable. The food is also awesome and not too pricey. My personal favorites are the sprouts with shaved parmesan as an appetizer and the pork chop as an entree. I also like the fact it is BYOB.
__label__1	This dunkin' location never has any donuts. NEVER. The worker Amanda is extremely rude and told me repeatedly that i did not give her the right amount of money when i payed in exact cash and tipped out of the kindness of my heart. she had told me that i could not give her a ten which is ridiculous. terrible service and donuts at this location. it's better to drive out to fairview. never coming here again.
__label__4	Food was delicious. We had scallops with two potato hash and skirt steak dish. Service was good until the end, I think he forgot about us. Can't go wrong with location and view of downtown.
__label__5	Epic gyros!  We had the lamb gyro and the felafel and were blown away by how good it was, how fresh the tzatziki white sauce was and just how much food you get.  Go hungry.
__label__4	Such a cute place. Tried their roasted chicken sandwich. My husband had the italian Panini yesterday. Both sandwiches were awesome. Ciabatta bread was so good. Just tried pepperoni pizza tonight. Was good too! Can't wait to try their ice cream!
__label__5	This is such an awesomely weird store! It's a costume shop, gift shop, hardware shop and convenience store all rolled into one.
__label__5	Absolutely fantastic!  The best BBQ I've ever had, and you can buy the sauce by the 1.5lb jars.  I had the brisket sandwich with baked beans and potato salad on the side, highly recommended.
__label__5	We had 8 girls for a private wine pairing this past Saturday in the gorgeous old hay loft above the barn with Meagan. We had such an amazing experience, but she really put it over the top with her touches! She was fun and educating! The wine was great and the pairings were beyond delicious! The property and history are amazing, but make sure you do a private tasting with Meagan, you won't regret it!
__label__1	Arrived early for my appointment. Then had to wait over 35 minutes and was asked to wait longer with no respect for my time. I understand emergencies, but I made an appointment at that time for a reason. At least let me know when I walk in that you are looking at a lengthy wait, total waste of time.
__label__1	We've ordered from Uptown/Sam's several times now. Tonight, I was craving pizza so my husband called and ordered for pickup. They told us 20-25 minutes. When he got there, they hadn't even started on our order and got an attitude with my husband. Even the owner acted like a complete jerk. I guess our quest for a great pizza place goes on...
__label__5	"One of the best Starbucks around.
Love that we finally have a drive through in sb! The line could be super long but they work the orders fast so the wait is never too long.

Today I went inside and with covid and everything going on they have great little signs and painted rocks that made me leave with a smile. They have a little station to paint rocks as well as a box of rocks you can pick from to take one home.

Plus amazing coffee and real straws! Sorry turtles but I hate the paper straws."
__label__5	"Love this place and very grateful for its existence.
Awesome service. 
Pilgrimage worthy food. 
Can't wait to make the trek back to Bettina!"
__label__5	"Carol House truly has beautiful furniture for the best prices.  There is something for everyone from traditional to contemporary and everything in between.  Plus they'll deliver it all for free.  

And now Carol House, which is a St. Louis owned and operated company for over 50 years, is following suit with companies like Amazon, Apple, and Fedex; and they are giving the entire sales staff a 10% raise.  People like the nice things at Carol House and the nice way they are helping employees and doing their part to add to the St. Louis economy."
__label__4	They do a great job with food allergies, including gluten and dairy free. I was able to get a gluten free bun and the fries are fried in a separate fryer so they are safe as well! Only downside was the rate of service and general cleanliness. It took awhile to get our food (45+ mins) and it's gets worse the busier it gets.
__label__4	We ordered a variety of the BBQ entrees. All were quite good, however the portions are small. They offer a variety of craft beers. My selection was pleasing. Our server was also tending the bar. He was quite knowledgeable and congenial.
__label__5	"Sabrina's is amazing. End of story. One of our favorite breakfast places in Philly. I can't even count the number of times that we've been here.

Portions are very generous. The food is absolutely amazing. The stuffed french toast is always to die for. If you're going with a date, split the stuffed french toast with another plate. You won't regret it.

This place is BYOB, so also a great place to go with a group of people when you're celebrating and bring champagne for mimosa's :) 

It gets crazy crowded on weekend mornings."
__label__5	My favorite donut shop in the city! I live right down the street from East Park (a blessing and a curse), and love going there to grab a vegan donut...or two...or three..., an oat milk hot chocolate, and hang out/work a few times a week! Free WiFi, delicious donuts and drinks, great service, an ice water station, clean bathrooms, plenty of parking: so happy East has this gem!
__label__5	I absolutely love their cakes.  I brought a layer cake into work for someone's birthday and everyone loved it.  They are very nicely decorated, they are absolutely delish and the price is great.  Their donuts are homemade and one of a kind.  The staff is very friendly. This place is a gem.
__label__4	"Dined at Zahav during restaurant week.  We were very happy with our experience.  First off, the service was great.  Everyone on the staff from the hostess to the bar to the waitstaff to the foodrunners was extremely professional, friendly and helpful.  It was a level above what you'd hope for, especially during restaurant week when so many customers are probably being a pain in the ass.
All food was excellent.  Very fresh, well presented.  The salad sampler was the highlight for us...highly reccomend it!
We will definitely return!"
__label__3	Good, super fast service. Clean tables and pretty spacious for dining inside. Chicken tastes as it should - super delicious and moist, with a slight sweetness. Had many chicken sandwiches ready in wake of the hype. Would recommend using some type of sauce for the second half of the chicken sandwich. One big negative about all Popeyes food is the insane amount of sodium - watch out for that and hopefully the chain will recreate their recipes appropriately.
__label__1	I was shopping for a specific item. An employee had a very large cart in the aisle.  I waited as she finished working in the section I was looking for.  She knew I was trying to find items in this area yet moved herself over but left large cart right where I was trying to look.  I asked if I could move her cart.  Not rude or demanding, just a request.  She looked at me, rolled her eyes and flipped her hair.  This is not the first time I've had employees act s as if I'm in their way, but definitely the most obnoxious!
__label__5	Had the most precious, perfect lunch here on Friday.  The food at 1862 is sublime - make friends with someone who is a member here just to dine here.  The service was a bit off on Friday, a tad overwhelmed - it was busy.  Whatever you get - it will be great!
__label__5	Charming spot with a super friendly staff who was completely honest when they told me they have the best quiche in the city.
__label__5	This, along with all of Forest Park, is the best place to visit on a nice day in St. Louis (especially if you're going with someone else--unless you're a nature lover).  Too bad the Chihuly exhibit is no longer there.  The Japanese festival takes place every Labor Day weekend.
__label__4	Came here with a Groupon for 4 to celebrate me and my best buddies birthday  It is very delicious and its fun to share food and the ambiance is nice and relaxing... They might want to invest in the paid Pandora with no commercials lol... I recommend this place for a nice relaxing meal
__label__5	I took my three dogs there it was their first time been groomed. They came back so soft and smelling amazing even with smiles on their faces. The amount of hair shedding has decreased significantly. We will definitely be back.
__label__3	Great service but the food quality has gone downhill. The chicken we had the other night was super dry, and the Mac and cheese was just far too cheesy and it congealed after a few min making it impossible to eat.
__label__1	If I could give this place negative stars I would. The staff is about as unfriendly as you could imaging, and has no sense of expedited service.  There is so much potential here, but they just fall so short.
__label__4	"I had a really good experience at Southgate during brunch. I initially had a table indoors but after realizing that the air conditioning was too cold for me, requested to move to an outside table. The waiter was very nice about it and quickly brought our stuff to a new table. The service was good and fast. All the employees were very polite and did a great job. 

Food-wise, the brunch menu has many options that are nice combinations of classic Korean and American food, and all of them are good. I'd highly recommend you to come here."
__label__2	"Ugh. This place. 
The food was worse than average. It was under seasoned and the combinations were just unappetizing. Why did our calamari and edamame come with a cherry anyway? I could get past that if the food was good but it was just terrible. The waiter was also very off putting and kept referring to us as girls. Will not be coming here again!"
__label__5	"Can't believe the negative reviews. This place was ""fabulous"". Staff (Maria & Sharon) were super cheerful  and attentive to the whole bar. I ordered tuna tataki bowl (wish I had taken a pic) the veggies were fresh, raw and added cilantro made it that much better. Hubby got the brown rice chicken sweet/sour. Very good. Five stars for price, service, food quality and SPEED! We are at an airport and need speed. Place is loud but that's to be expected."
__label__5	I LOVE CRAVE! It's the best coffee shop in Tucson hands down. They have an amazing variety of coffee and treats (best tiramisu ever), and the ambiance is very beautiful and calm. I've been looking for good coffee shops in Tucson where I can come, study, or just chat with friends, but this coffee shop isn't good, it's GREAT. No coffee shop in Tucson compares to this one!
__label__5	Excellent, same day service. I've dropped in a couple times and was taken care of ASAP. Give this guy your business.
__label__5	When I first started coming to Pam, my hair was over processed, thin, and broken. I've been coming here for 3 years now and my hair is amazing, healthier than it's ever been. And the color is always nice. She is really great at making blonde highlights look natural but still beautiful.
__label__4	Upscale atmosphere for reasonable priced food. I love that all of the entrees are healthy for you and they have a nice drink menu as well. The food always seems very fresh and is constantly changing.
__label__4	Timed tickets so the place isn't overcrowded and plenty of space to move around. The place is beautiful, our favorite was the tree house..if only you could rent it for the night. We didn't catch the fountain show but walking around can really make you feel like a Disney princess.
__label__1	RUN PAST LITTLE CAESARS  you'll thank me I promise that , Pizza Hut is right next door LITTLE Caesars have raised there prices to the point there not worth going to and with the poorly cooked pizza long wait times and chaos that's always happening just go to Pizza Hut or any were other the this poorly ran business. You have been warned
__label__2	"The coffee is so watery, it looked like milk, not coffee and cream. Either management is cheap and waters down the coffee, or the machine is broken. Either way is not acceptable. I ended up throwing the coffee out and going to a different McDonald's. 

2 stars though because the staff are really nice."
__label__4	Speakeasy hideaway in Northern Liberties. Menu features classic cocktails from the 19th and 20th centuries, as well as some modern mixology. Drinks are reasonably priced, the staff are friendly, and the decor is dark and quirky. Smart tunes enhance the bohemian environment.
__label__5	Great service! It was quick and well done. Eyebrow threading can hurt but it's worth it for the results that last longer. I had a great experience here and well done eyebrows. Definitely recommend it!
__label__5	Had dinner here last night with a group of 10. I had the spaghetti with meatballs and I must say it was excellent. The pasta was cooked perfect Al dente, the meatballs were tender and delicious and the sauce was creamy and awesome. The table bread was a real treat especially when slathering on the olive oil/pesto sauce. My wife had the eggplant parmesan and she said it was excellent too. Everyone in our group was very pleased with our meals. We'll be back.
__label__1	80 minutes in line!!! EIGHTY MINUTES IN LINE... Trapped!!!  When I asked for CF sauce for the TWO family meals, I waited again and given looks by staff for holding up the line.  He came back with 2! TWO SAUCE TUBS FOR TWO FAMILY MEALS!  most inefficient restaurant drive through EVER!!!  Go to PDQ in Riverview HANDS DOWN!!
__label__5	I've had an incredibly positive experience with the Pro-Active Physical Therapy team and recommend their care with the highest level of confidence. I was referred to the practice after I had an ACL revision and I needed to return to high level activity for my job in professional sports. Their expertise combined with technology and personal care makes for a highly effective healing environment. Highly recommended!
__label__3	"Mini curry bowl with tiny fried chicken and a smattering if curry. Not great.

Pork belly bun. Had tomato, weird. Tiny piece of dried pork belly.

House Ramen seemed under cooked. Pork belly in the ramen was good.

Philly Chinatown location is better"
__label__4	"This is a great restaurant serving a great selection of gourmet burgers. Sit at the bar and enjoy the TV and helpful staff or sit communal along the long table. There is other seating options available but they are minimal.

All in all a great dining experience and one I would highly recommend! 

Food is very good
Atmosphere/Décor - Very Nice
Wait staff - Friendly, courteous, timely and cool clothing!
Price - Acceptable/ Reasonable"
__label__1	"I just wanted a good, tasty banh mi, and they gave me a PRE-MADE bland sandwich.  (I've never been to a place where they don't make them to order.)  

In my whole life, this was the first banh mi that I didn't finish!  Bleeccch!!!  Bad bad bad!!!"
__label__5	It's rare to find a company that provides excellent service without trying to make you spend more than you want to. Pottstown Auto Wash is one of those rare companies. It turned this person who never gets his car cleaned into somebody who wants to do it all the time. Great job at a great price with great service. Not much more to say.
__label__5	Amazing place to go for all health care needs. I think the office has such an amazing concept to integrate natural health care by having multiple providers in the same office there is a nurse practioner, chiropractor and massage therapist. They offer weight loss consultations, adjustments, pain relief, and amazing massages and do it all as a team. Love the flow of the office!
__label__1	Paid $10 cover and the place was way over max capacity. You couldn't even walk and ended up being stuck like sardines with no where to go upon entering. We requested a refund within 5 minutes and they refused. They should be managing to max occupancy and also could have said something prior to taking our money. Poor customer service and safety hazard.
__label__5	Awesome food and service.  I had the 2 inch cut, 3 pound pork steak, it's was tender, and melted in my mouth!!!  Definitely a great place and food!!!
__label__5	Another killer job. Just got a new truck and job 1 was to get the tint done. Dropped it off and it was done in an hour. Super affordable and he does an awesome job. Very friendly guy too. I've sent probably a dozen people here to get tint done and everyone of them has been perfectly happy!
__label__5	Nice clean store, great selection,  and friendly employees! I stumbled in there not looking for anything in particular and this really cute employee, Savannah asked me what kinda music I was into and after a second was able to pick out something I've never heard that suites my taste perfectly!  Went in not expecting to get anything and now I'm a huge rhudabega fan!
__label__5	Excellent service. Bill is very responsive ave extremely helpful. Would recommend these guys to anyone.
__label__4	The texture of these snoballs is incredible. Super silky and creamy. Flavors are excellent. Flavor profiles are rich and sweet (praline, chocolate, cake). I'd like to see more tart flavors for contrast. Facility is really nice and clean. Staff is super friendly and warm.
__label__1	DON'T STAY HERE THEY HAVE BED BUGS. After two hours of laying in bed watching tv I noticed a bug crawling on the sheet then started to notice a few more. I checked out immediately and asked for a refund and they said we will have to speak to a manager in the morning. They better give me a refund. I keep feeling like they are crawling on me.
__label__4	"On our trip to Florida, my uncle's friend had brought us here for dinner with his family and boy am I glad he did that. This place is amazing! The chicken was delicious and their macaroni was just OUT OF THIS WORLD. I'm not really sure what it is about the macaroni, but I am totally in love with it! 

I just wish California had this place.. Oh Florida, how I miss you so. :["
__label__5	Awesome place to come get at a edamame and sushi, great outdoor patio and atmosphere! Our waitress was great and very attentive I would highly recommend!
__label__5	Their custard is the best tasting I've had in years. The consistency is just right. Most places mix in so much air that the custard's consistency is too light and fluffy. Not Maple Shade Custard Stand. The hot fudge and wet-walnuts are also great. It reminds me of a mom & pop custard stand in the town where I grew up. Unfortunately for the customers the land that stand was on became so valuable it was redeveloped into an office building. Hope that doesn't happen here.
__label__4	Loved the drinks - its a tad pricey, but incredibly entertaining to watch the drinks being created (we scored two very coveted stools at the bar). Take your New Yorker friends, they won't balk at the prices and the whole scene is a hell of a good time. Need to try the food next time.
__label__5	I've been here several times and have yet to be disappointed! The seafood is always fresh and well seasoned. There are a lot of places that serve barbecue shrimp, but Oceana's is definitely in my top 5. I have yet to try the desserts because I'm always stuffed! Great food, good service!
__label__3	I have to say that I'm a fan of the wings here.  The BBQ sauce has this smoky flavor reminiscent of this thing Chinese restaurants do to store bought sauces by heating it up in a wok, caramelizing some of the sugars... but you know what... that's about all I liked about this place.  The service was friendly but this will only be a place I'll stop at if I'm already in the area.
__label__5	Unbelievable park!! Spent hours walking with my dog enjoying the weather and the views!  There are multiple places to park and several activities to do.
__label__5	It really goes without saying that if you come to New Orleans, you have to visit the French Quarter. It's a perfect fusion of the weird, the strange, the beautiful and the creative. Lots of unique art, amazing music, delicious food and of course weird, wild people. Definitely one of the most interesting places we've ever visited.
__label__5	"Truly one of the best and highest quality pasta that I have ever had!! What an amazing restaurant; the service is exceptional, and the food quality amazing.

I highly recommend this place!!"
__label__5	Food was phenomenal.  Everything we had was great.  Guac, esquites and the five different types of tacos we had.  Pineapple margarita was delicious.  If we are back in Nashville we would definitely come back here.
__label__5	I was so incredibly sad when the Philly location closed down years ago. I LOVE the yogurt at Yogorino. No, I'm actually obsessed! It's not like the artificial frozen yogurt you see at other places. This place is the real deal. You can taste the quality. The toppings are excellent as well. I love how the chocolate sauce turns into a hard shell over the cold yogurt. Mmmm... so good!!!
__label__1	ENOUGH....I get it...you don't want my business...if you did you would stop cancelling flight after flight and actually care about your customers precious few days they get to vacation each year.......i will try my best to avoid us airways going forward...and others should too unless they like spending their vacation in the airport.
__label__4	This location is so friendly and nice. They get through the line super fast. The only problem is, there's always a line and for those of us who follow the protocol and get in line the correct way, there's always a ton of people coming in through the exit on the other end cutting everyone in line. If they could fix this issue, it'd be the perfect store!
__label__5	"Great spot. Always super friendly and super laid back. Great for take out and has some good weekend specials. Crab cakes are as close to home as we have found in St Pete, and the crab soup, Famous Beef sandwich, and fries are on point too. 

Location is the perfect spot to stop on the way to or from the beach."
__label__5	"Awesome. The hamburger w frued onions was to die for. Well worth it. My companion had a salad for the first time. He said it was better than anything he ever had. And it was VERY  inexpensive compatef to others. Fettung one tomorrow for

    him. Went next day had chicken rice soup. Soooo good not salty and real good. Inly $1.25 ."
__label__5	Very cool locals only spot. If you're visiting Nashville and want a cool spot to hang outside of Broadway this is it!
__label__5	Ace Hardware Rockery is a great little store. The assistants are all so helpful. They know where everything is and want to help the customers find exactly what they need. If you are not quite sure about what you need they will help with suggestions and ideas. All the servers are so nice. They welcome you when you come in the door and are happy to help. If you just want to wander the isles that is fine too. Prices are good and they provide services that the big box stores will not do such as rekeying locks. Which I really appreciate. Way to go Rockery Ace. :)
__label__5	Awesome cheesesteaks. Awesome hoagies too. One of the best cheesesteaks in philly, esp if you like chopped steak as oppose to the flank. Seating is limited, but you can sit inside which is nice. They also have beers and fountain soda which you can get free refills on. Another underrated feature is the parking. Real easy to park unlike the other places in the city. Cash only is probably the only negative, but all the best steak joints are cash only.
__label__3	i work across the street from jean's cafe. it's hard to not get breakfast at this place. awesome selection of beverages and breakfast combos. they offer egg white substitutions on all omlettes, which i love. the home fried potatoes are always delicious. service is friendly and efficient and the prices are not too bad!
__label__5	Fun,unique brewery!!! Normally don't get stouts but the Foxy was amazing n didn't even taste much like a stout. The Holly Roller Side walk IPA was amazing as well and very hazy! Recommend this place !!
__label__2	Been going to this place for years and used to absolutely love it. They recently changed the menu, and it just doesn't measure up anymore. :/ Their old strozzapreti recipe was probably the best pasta you could find in St. Louis, and now it's gone and replaced with a new, subpar recipe. Super disappointing. We'll be back if they bring the old strozzapreti back!
__label__1	"Inconsistency, inconsistency and again inconsistency
Daughter ordered two platters only sent one but two orders of corn bread and two sodas... mac and cheese sucked. Not worth the chance anymore. When she called the young lady argued that she only ordered one . Lucky one platter is large enough to share. You never know what you're going to get quality wise or accuracy from order to order, day to day... but I'm done with ordering from here anymore and will not recommend them."
__label__5	Absolutely amazing! Natalie was so nice and walked us through everything we would need to make sure our stuff stayed dry and smelling great! Plus the storage unit was so clean and very accessible.
__label__2	The only good thing about this airport is that they have decent air conditioning and clean bathrooms. Their food options are super limited, very few charging stations and there are not enough chairs for passengers awaiting flights.
__label__1	all their stores are shutting down and now there is almost only toy stores and the robotics center in the shopping center.
__label__1	We checked in, and the person at the front desk was super nice and helpful. However, when we got to our room, the door was dead bolted open, and someone had just been smoking in there. We went back and swapped rooms, only to find a shower filled with hair and a roach in the bedside table. Luckily we got out of there with a refund. Avoid this place!
__label__5	Hi all.  We just came to shells for our goodbye meal ( were moving back to California) and we got our favorite waitress, Jill. She is awesome.  I recommend you sit outside and enjoy the Florida beach air,  and the awesome service. The food was great,  as always.  I got the snow crab,  which was perfect.  I never have room for dessert,  but if you do...I recommend the key lime pie.  I'm gonna miss you Jill, and Shells. I've been eating here since you were on 4 th street.
__label__5	I can't say enough good things about the staff at Peterson Toyota  in Boise.  Ben Rodgers  was the salesman who sold me my used Subaru.  He was professional and friendly and only showed me cars in my price range.  I had been looking  for a car for several  months before I went to Peterson.  I wish I would have gone there first. I was very impressed with Ben.  And I love my car,  it's  perfect for my family and I .
__label__2	"I called to ask a couple of questions. Spoke with Jeannie. She was very unfriendly and downright rude. She was VERY inconvenienced by my call and wanted to make that clear to me. Why are my dues paying her salary??? In no way should she be answering phones...

Editing review. Valarie contacted me this morning and was very kind and polite. Maybe she should be taking calls instead of Jeannie."
__label__5	So kind! Great food! A lunch on their porch is a visit to an oasis--vegetarian or not. I miss the Sundays with music and all of my lovely friends eating a communal today, but ...
__label__5	Super for  breakfast and even better for brunch! Super yummy morning beverages! Wonderful dishes, and the bacon is unbelievable!
__label__4	"I had the blueberry crumble ice cream, it was delicious.  Not a place I want to linger in though.  There were a lot of screaming kids inside. 
I like their milk, but don't like the glass bottle.  It's a hassle to return and I've had one break in the car.  The organic milk at Global Foods is just as good, and it comes in a carton."
__label__3	Walking in, we loved to see the menu on the big new screens. But it changes so fast to advertisements that you can't really read it. Then the counter girl should at least be able to tell us what PDQ sauce is like. Dirty tables everywhere. And the soda machine spit ice all over me, then soda too. So it's been a bit of a disaster. At least the food was good. New spicy nuggets were a win and the 4Rivers sandwich was good too. Love the tater tots. Reviewing in hopes of seeing change.
__label__4	Great tortillas, donuts, horchata, breakfast burritos, and I love the machaca burrito. The salsa is yum, but they only give you a tiny amount, so you may want to ask for more. The owners are warm and welcoming. This is my favorite neighborhood market, and I'm lucky to live so close.
__label__1	I tried 3 times. Every time disappointed. Foods are good. Workers are rude and no patient. This is a good location and really need a decent leader or manager.
__label__5	I see all these negative reviews regarding trash truck positioning, lack of professionalism and customer service but I'm assuming they have all been written by the 'Karen's' of our society. These are hardworking individuals and without them our city would be a disaster. 7 days a week they clean our houses and streets and working directly with the facility is a breeze. These men and women are up early and working late to serve us, most being paid minimum wage. People will complain about anything. Be nice to people and you will get what you give in return.
__label__5	"I'm not sure why it took me so long to stop at this Mexican oasis here in Brandon. Thankfully I did just that. One Carne Asada burrito,  one Barbacoa taco, one Carne Asada taco and a Pollo Asada taco too!  Lots of food, but completely worth every bite!  After MANY years and visits to taco trucks all throughout central amd southern California,  this place is just like home..authentic and delicious!  
I will be back and with the family!"
__label__4	"K and I had an outstanding breakfast here on Tuesday morning at the Sea-Guina restaurant..
Our server Costa was professional and right on the spot at every turn.

We sat outside by the pool and facing the ocean with an outstanding view of the ocean.

We each had one of the Benedicts which were excellent.
The coffee was exceptional as was the bread/toast and the grits.

Just a great all around experience."
__label__4	This was great. Fantastic service, timely food, and very attentive staff. The food was delicious and the chef was very friendly, entertaining, and his experienced shown through his expertly prepared and presented dishes. I would highly recommend
__label__2	I guess someone removed my original review because it was not very complementary. So, I say again, the only good thing about my sandwich was the very delicious whole-grain roll it was served on. Other than that I found the sandwich to be very overpriced for the amount of protein included and the overwhelming amount of iceberg lettuce that took its place. I was also served a totally different sandwich than I ordered. I asked for the one that included several different kinds of meat but I was served a turkey sandwich.
__label__5	Our table was able to try a little bit of everything on the menu. My favorites were the Reuben, the Calamari, the Texas Style all-beef Chili and the Smoky Mac n' Cheese. I loved the revamp of the restaurant from the previous Rise Kitchen and Bakery. But, don't let that fool you! They still have all of their pastries, desserts and favorite coffee drinks. So good!  The food was amazing and I will definitely be back for more!
__label__5	Chuck is a classic barber and does great work! They have the regular salon stuff here, but they also have the old school barbers in the front for the guys. Clean shop, great staff. I have used multiple times and suggest to all my friends.
__label__4	I love the green bully juice, and their lunch bowls are all delicious, and taste clean and wholesome. Staff is quite friendly. Great portions, but just a tad bit expensive-hence the 4 stars. Wish I could eat here for lunch more often but it would cost me close to $20 for a bowl and a juice. Just not doable all the time. Definitely recommend for a nice healthy occasional lunch.
__label__2	Food used to be good, and we would come here alot but recently it's made a change. The servers that we used to see, and talk to weren't there as much, the service was worse, and the food was not good. We have given it multiple tries before ultimately giving up on this place.
__label__1	"Extremely disappointed in this salon. Hair looks terrible. Tried to talk to stylist after appointment but he refused to do anything to make it look better. 

The only good thing was calling on Friday and getting it done on Sunday before the salon opened at 11 a.m.

I am on the road now so I don't have time to get it done again for awhile. For $135, i would have thought I could have better service."
__label__5	"Best sushi spot in the city.  Superb quality, never any ""fishy"" tastes.  Everything is great, if you're lucky and the sushi chef offers you a special--take it!!

By the way - they do a fantastic job with both large and small parties, I've been to group parties here several times in the back room & it's always been fantastic and seamless service.

Special shout out for the awesome Sake Sangria & Blackberry Ginger cocktails."
__label__4	Wonderful dinner! Got the BBQ on jalapeño waffle. Delicious. A party of 70 walked in before us, but we were seated and fed in an appropriate time.
__label__1	"I usually don't post reviews but felt the need this time.

If you are happy paying $28 for a handful (and that is being generous) of vegetables or a hot piece of rock this is the place for you. Other food was adequate but overly season. Not a place that I would ever return to or recommend.  There was no option for zero stars."
__label__5	Great location fast service. The young lady at the counter worked fast and efficient. Should have at least 2 people on staff to prevent a backup. I like the knowledge of the staff. Will definitely use this store again.
__label__5	Wow is all I could say. First off we were seated immediately. I wanted to pig out the menu had so many options. So I asked the Waiter what he recommended for an appetizer. All I have to say is wow. The entire meal was great. I ordered crab soup too amd tasted my friends food. Nothing fell short of amazing.
__label__1	"This place is the Old Spaghetti Factory of New Orleans. Outside it seems like a small, authentic restaurant with typical NOLA/Southern food, but inside it is enormous. 500 seats! They do serve all the typical southern dishes, but we didn't like anything we tasted. The blackened alligator appetizer was good, but everything else was dry and flavorless. I loaded my food with the hot sauce (which was surprisingly good!) to add some flavor. 
We did love our server, Alex, though! He was very friendly and the best part of our dinner."
__label__3	This place is just a staple. We stopped in for a burger and root beer just before closing. The staff accommodated us but were unimpressed with our timeliness. Always consistent and a quality burger. Don't forget they're cash only.
__label__5	I'll I can say is that my husband and I love the food here!  Viva la fiesta everyday!
__label__4	"We ordered a large pizza, wings and garlic knots for delivery. Delivery time was about an hour. The large pizza had toppings: half pepperoni and half pepperoni & sausage (the sausage is crumbles). The pizza was good although a bit salty; I did enjoy the crust . The garlic knots lacked garlic and the marinara sauce was a bit watery. The wings were crispy and seasoned well. 

Overall the food was tasty."
__label__4	What a wonderful restaurant...the food..the price...the entertainment-Superb! The waiters that sang were wounderful-such beautiful voices. Our non singing waiter was a little airheaded though lol... other then that..look forward to going back!
__label__1	Gosh, the robo-reply was great, but I'm back to California Taco. Fresh, friendly and it just tastes better.
__label__4	Best BLT I've had ever. The juicy tomatoe, the thick sliced bacon, the fresh mozzarella... I wanted another sandwich by the end of it because the flavored were so wonderful! But I was stuffed because it the sandwich was so big!
__label__4	Good spot for a quick and tasty smoothie. It's next to my nail salon and I was craving a smoothie. It was clean and a quick order, I was greeted right away with a friendly greeting. I ordered a green smoothie that included ginger, spinach, kale, pineapple....it was really tasty. They have paninis that looked very good but I didn't order since I wasn't as hungry. I will def return to try out as they make them in front of you as you order.
__label__5	Was rear ended by a drunk driver today and had to have my SUV towed. Michael was timely, true gentlemen, clean  truck and made me laugh after a horrific morning. I will only use this company in the future should I ever need. HIGHLY RECOMMEND
__label__3	I've liked this place since I first ate there a year ago.   I've ordered it through uber eats recently, and today I ordered the usual.  The burger is beyond greasy and the bun is mushy.  Unlike the fries of old with parmesan and herbs, the fries have changed,  maybe half the amount, and it's pretty much dried Rosemary, which is way to overpowering,  with no Parmesan cheese.  Not edible.   They are mushy and completely undercooked.  Beyond disappointed for the price it is. Maybe they can't handle delivery?
__label__4	This is for happy hour or as my work friends call it, an external department eating meeting. Appetizers are half off and drink are a dollar cheaper. We always manage a seat at the bar where service is prompt, friendly and attentive. This last time, we ordered tacos (3 per serving) crab cakes (yup, 3 per serving) and a big platter of nachos. Food is pretty basic, no fancy ingredients sprinkled randomly on yer meal. But it serves its purpose when washed down with a big old glass of cold beer.
__label__2	I stopped him here several times it just has a cold feeling in there not very warm and inviting the food is just OK I think there could be a lot of improvement.
__label__4	A bit of the delirious art of Salvatore Dali in St.Petersburg.
__label__3	"Well, they ""can't take Jeeps"" so FYI don't bring a Jeep here, not even a Renegade. They did an OK job on the previous car I had, it's high priced for the wash. Won't be stopping by here again, since I actually can't."
__label__1	"FOOD POISONING!! 
My girlfriend and I read the reviews and saw the terrible reviews but thought to still go for the beatific scenery, don't go! 

Awoke in the middle of the night with food poisoning. Besides that the service was TERRIBLE! 

If you get to sit outside maybe it's worth it, but don't go for good food or good service."
__label__5	This is truly the best breakfast around. They cook eggs in all kinds of terrific ways, and all the other options that they have (chicken livers?!) are creative. A warning that some of the omelettes seem to put the fillings on top of the eggs, but it's delicious so who cares.
__label__1	I literally have no words for these people. Ive lived in U. City for 10 years and have amassed what, 30 parking tickets (?) for the most BULLSHIT reasons.
__label__5	Just what New Hope needed. A cheap family friendly place with good food. It's a window style restaurant, so you go up, order, and take a number and they bring your food to you. They also serve Nina's ice cream there. The Lou Lou's Special Ice Cream Sandwich is amazing. It's a nice addition to  New Hope and I hope it stays there.
__label__4	All around excellent, but there are one or two family owned places that serve a better burrito.
__label__3	Sampan  I has wonderful decor and items that should be good based on their descriptions in the menu. However if you do t go for happy hour when very thing is 1/2 price then the menu is overpriced for what you get. Their roasted peppers are very good. Their drinks (especially the fish bowl) are average in preparation. Good choice for predictable hipster food and drink.
__label__4	Great Mediterranean food. Love the hummus and  tea! I wish they had table service but it's a nice place.
__label__3	"My buddy and I had dinner on 2/27/19 around 6pm.
Having visited the restaurant in the past we were looking forward to a nice meal at a respected restaurant. We were early enough to take advantage of the 15% discount on the meal. I wish I was told by the waitress that the proportion would be smaller because of when we visited the restaurant. My Sea-bass order was a disappointment.
Don't offer a meal with a discount when the portion is ridiculously small."
__label__5	Have never had to wait more than 5 mins for a table even if the parking lot is full. :) Always tasty and a good time.
__label__1	"This place is a dump.. The beer was pretty good but the food is garbage. We got the nachos (with stale chips) and the buffalo wrap (that didn't have any buffalo sauce and fell apart).. Each came out 30-40min apart. 

Asked multiple times to get the cardinals game on, never happened. 

If you have a long time to wait on mediocre everything give this place a try. If not you can do much better without the head ache."
__label__4	"Oh hello old friend. Taco bell is always there when I need it. I even came here for my birthday dinner this year. Yup, it's true. This Taco Bell is better than your average Taco Bell. Recently renovated or constructed. Ample parking. Quick and surprisingly friendly service. 

Recently, they did run out of several of the sauces. All they had left was mild and verde. I was happy to see they had stocked up again on my last visit."
__label__5	Great night life!  Fun band that had a great song set.  Everyone was dancing and singing along. Cold beer too!
__label__3	Eh...It was cool little shops but overall, it's a huge tourist trap.  I would avoid it, you'd end up wasting on money on things that sound good but are actually a piece.
__label__1	"After over 20 rentals with Avis this year, I am moving to Hertz. Their gizmo attached to the windshield charges me for tolls, even when I pay cash. Making this worse, the Avis ""convenience fee"" triples the actual toll charge. Even worse, the charges show up a week later, after I have submitted my travel expenses for reimbursement. Can it get worse - YES. I have written to Avis - no reply.
AVOID AVIS EVERWHERE,"
__label__4	Great place for a good sandwich. Fresh bread and plenty of cold cuts on the sandwich.
__label__4	Food was good. Service was good but interesting. Staff gave that southern hospitality. I gave it a 4 star due to getting my food at different times.
__label__5	"Went to Alicia about two months ago and she did SUCH a great job. Her and I have known eachother for a long time, but I just recently went to her for the first time. It was hard not going to my other, regular stylist, but definitely worth it. I just asked for cut and ombre/balayage/highlights. Amazing work. Subtle, yet noticeable change in my look - just what I wanted.

Get in touch with Alicia if you want to look your best! :)"
__label__2	Space is trendy but for working,  it's lacking.  No outlets, tables are small,  noisy and parking was a hassle.  I ended up paying $10 for parking just to walk in and realize I can't work here.
__label__5	Very cool place w 7 beers to try.   Wait staff very friendly.  Would definitely come back. They have board games to play
__label__4	I've eaten here a few different times. I have to say that if I'm in the mood for a little Greek, this place is good for that. They have a nice little patio outside seating area too if you want to enjoy your food and the weather, as well as inside too. I've tried the shrimp Greek bowl, Gyro, hummus and pita and baklava. All were very delicious.
__label__5	Everyone was very helpful at the dealership. Mike was friendly and took good care of my vehicle. They even washed my vehicle after the service. I was here for about 2 hours but the waiting room was full so I understand it was busy plus they washed it; so it's not a big deal. I'll be going back for my next service.
__label__4	"Good food at a good price.  I had the 'famous' Wing Basket... It was ok - nothing special or noteworthy - just wings.  
My Boo got the ""Awful Awful Burger""... NOW this was of the 'famous' description it has been given - it is your basic cheese burger done right - and if the regular with its accompanying 1lb of fries isn't enough to fill you up, you can make it a double.   I will be getting the Awful Awful Burger for myself next visit."
__label__5	"Came in last month for an oil change and Chi noticed that there was a huge bubble on one of my tires. (Thanks, winter potholes.) So glad he saw this, otherwise I may still be driving with a potential hazard just waiting to explode. 

I had the tire replaced, as well as the ABS sensor since the light has been going off lately. Chi was very responsive from the estimate on time and pricing, and completed the work within the time frame that he quoted. 

Very happy with the service that was performed! Great guy who does honest work."
__label__4	Just ate at Jenny's for the 3rd time, and we're big fans. Every dish we've had (a variety of Omelets and skillets) was very good, and very affordable. Highly suggest the Fiesta Skillet. Service is always fast and friendly, and you never lack for a coffee refill. Love this place!
__label__5	True food kitchen is great for those looking for healthier menu options. Obviously they have vegan and vegetarian options as well as regular options! We went for brunch and Rose was our waitress -she was wonderful! She immediately brought out our dog Jax water and gave us a full rundown of the non-inflammatory food pyramid menu. We will be going back with and without the pup!
__label__5	Wow!  What a great spot.  Food is great.  Little expensive but worth it.  I hope this place survives the recession cause I want to keep coming back here for a long long time.   Try the spicy lamb tacos.
__label__4	"$2 hamburgers! We've been twice this week for their special which is $2 hamburgers and a $1 for fries. These are good burgers too! I've also had their chicken ranch wrap and it was pretty much the best wrap I've had. Everything is cut up nice and tiny for easy biting and less mess making. Their housemade chips are very good.

It's a sports bar, nothing fancy, but solid lunch or dinner choice."
__label__1	Wow! Pretty sure this is the longest I've ever sat in the drive-through in my whole life! Literally took them 20 minutes to make a medium Americano coffee. Yikes! Definitely won't be back!
__label__4	Food really good. Different combos than what one typically gets. Philly cheese sandwich real good. Vegan panini quite tasty. Service excellent.  Food real good.
__label__4	After an unfortunate incident on our first visit, the restaurant called us back to make things right. As it was on the first visit, the food was once again excellent in this cozy, South Philly BYO (with Center City prices). The service was very attentive and we thoroughly enjoyed our evening. We will put Fond on our list of favorites.
__label__4	Great burgers, amazing fries, delicious ice cream and we got it delivered by Uber eats to our hotel. Nothing beats all that.
__label__4	"2 for 1 wednesdays-
try the 'sakitos' (mojitos with sake instead of rum) for 7.50
buy a roll over $8 and be sure to ask for the 'happy hour roll'-they'll give you four pieces of a chef's choice roll in addition to your meal.

I thought it was delicious-my rainbow roll was fresh and tasty, our server was nice and attentive, and we tried some garlic-soy edemame which was a nice twist on the regular."
__label__5	"I really love this bar, though it does have a bit less of an old-school, dive-y feel since they did some remodeling to the facade of the building and Russell is no longer around to yell at unsuspecting patrons about putting their coats over the backs of their chairs or bird-dogging.  

They don't take credit cards, so make sure you come with cash.  There's also an ATM in the corner in case of emergencies, but I'm not sure what the fee is.  Overall, an awesome local place to grab a beer or three."
__label__4	They have really good pizza at $1 a slice. Just think you could go to maxis and buy 1 slice of go across the way and get 4 slices. I give way too much money to this 7-11. Better than most other meth head roadside 7-11's
__label__1	Came in here today needing something as simple as my business statements printed. I sat and waited with no one here to help. Seems like that's always the case as chase bank. When it was time for someone to help me they let me know it was gonna cost me money to have a few pieces of paper printed out. $1 per page.... I didn't know a white piece of paper costed a dollar to print per page. I opened my business with chase in August and it was the biggest mistake I've made. Definitely should have stayed with BANK OF AMERICA.
__label__5	I have been taking my Honda civic to Co Auto since I got my car. They are best and I feel like they take awesome care of me and my car. I highly recommend them for auto service.  I will continue to take my car there!!
__label__3	This review would've been at least 4 stars, had it not been for the 40 min wait for our order. The food was delicious and the portions were great, but we became the textbook definition of HANGRY by the time the food rolled around. Our server was also excellent and very attentive... But our stomachs were still angry :(
__label__1	No stars should be an option to rate this location. Arrogant, unfriendly, impatient are a few words that come to mind. One would expect the manager to hold the standard for service but Eisha was clearly not trained in the way I have come to expect from enterprise. I will be using other rental car companies from here on out as I doubt they could be any worse.
__label__3	Nice but a little too uppity for my taste. Small plates were a bit too small for the price.
__label__4	AWESOME tofu vermicelli!!! Thought it a bit weird that since the vermicelli with tofu was vegetarian it did not include the spring rolls like the meat versions did but yet came with fish sauce. This is something that may upset many vegetarians (not to mention vegans). All together very impressed with the food & the seasonal tea!
__label__1	If only zero stars were an option. The insane level of incompetence is baffling. Folks were nice enough, it really just seems like Hertz as a company is the problem. Just go anywhere else.
__label__4	Pretty good ramen. I'm a creature of habit, I had the tantan, so sue me. My friend had the veggie miso ramen and we shared a potato croquette curry which was to die for. Without a doubt, my favorite dishes at Maru Noodle Shop is the curry. I've also had the pork katsu curry and the pork cutlet was both crispy and juicy and it melted in my mouth. You could definitely find better ramen elsewhere, but this wasn't disappointing by any stretch.
__label__4	I have been coming here many years now. I order the same every time. The food is great. I do wish they would use real grilled chicken breast in their curry, instead of the rubbery sliced chicken they put, but none the less the green curry sauce is so good, and I love the peanut sauce. I would like the owner to be a little friendlier. I brought my friend in to dine and he was not pleasant, but the food is good. I just get take out.
__label__4	I had such a great experience with Ryan! I told him the vision I wanted and he was able to achieve that perfectly. Not only were the stylists super friendly and helpful, the actual salon was wonderful. From the moment I walked in to when I left, I felt very calm and taken care off. The herbal tea and completely massage was just a cherry on top. Definitely found my new stylist!
__label__5	"Inventory is top notch.
Lounge is comfortable, big and welcoming.
Staff is great.

Trump should have stopped here before he visited the WaWa next door."
__label__1	DO NOT GO HERE. I went despite reading the bad reviews and regretted it. I went out with a friend on a Saturday night at 10:30. They charged us $20 each at the door! Which was an insane cover charge but we were under 21 and it was the only place we could find that was 18+ so we paid. We walked upstairs and were the ONLY PEOPLE IN THE ENTIRE PLACE. It was completely empty and we had wasted 40 bucks to the assholes at the door.
__label__1	Just had the worst experience of customer service at this establishment. We recently purchased items and unfortunately forgot some stuff. Went back and explained and we're treated by Fabian like we were lying stating that we had such a big list of items and how it was interesting that we were only missing two things. He told is basically to shoo with a wave of his hand and to go and get our stuff. Have never been so pissed off in my life.
__label__1	I live in Lakeland .... I got here at 125pm on a Thursday and no one was there ... mind you when I lived in the area it was always happening
__label__3	"REALLY intense menu: ""inviting the chile chipotle to participate as a witness in the lynching of the fabulous filet."" 

""Trenza (braids) are par excellence the most fashionable style for the country woman. Nothing is more beautiful than an imposing and timid country woman, adorned with the complex knots that crown her head.""

Food is good, ambiance stuffy."
__label__5	Finally open and it was worth the wait!  Authentic food that tasted good.  Menu was small but had all the staples of traditional greek food.  They also had some nice vegetarian dishes that were awesome!
__label__5	When I tell you the food here is good. He only problem I have is with some of the servers don't smile enough to the customers. Besides that I love bringing my family to this place to eat.
__label__3	Pho was good, but they need to keep Sriracha on the table instead of giving you a tiny amount in a cup..  Wont go there again unless I hear they've changed this practice!
__label__4	"BurgerFuel seems to be trying so hard, but it seems like some of the initial excitement has worn off. I've been here twice now and was a bit ""meh"" each time. Service is friendly and great. I like all of the options on paper, but I personally think the burgers are a bit rich and the fries and bites are pretty dry. I usually love a good aioli, but the ones here don't make up for the dry side dishes. I wish they had ciders on tap instead of just beer. Free parking is a huge perk, though!"
__label__5	This place is great.  Right on the strip up from pier 60. The service was wonderful and brandy was super sweet.  Food was on spot and the prices are super reasonable.  We will be back for multiple date nights.
__label__5	Here at Frenchy's nine of us here waitresses great very friendly and helpful you come here you can see her (Stephanie )  in the food was outstanding
__label__1	Very disappointed in this shop went to Andy for awhile until he charged me 5$ for a nail repair an he only put acrylic on, then started with new girl that is there an she does not listen to customer always had a huge ridge at base of my nail she would never file it down had a fungus grow on nail . Then asked for a layer of sparkle on top of pink an white she said that would be FIVE DOLLARS ?!?what I could buy a bottle went to another salon they fixed what she did put sparkle on for FREE!!
__label__3	I've been washing here since the beginning.. Yes the staff is really nice. Just don't go late at night, most times you end up taking your own clothes in..other than that its a nice place to do laundry.
__label__5	If i could go here everyday, I would.  The cantaloupe flavour is my favorite!  But its best to branch out here and try new interesting flavours, like green tea or avocado, you'd be surprised at how delicious they are.  My only complaint is that they aren't open on Mondays.  But it is a small business and I know how important it is to have days off.  I don't blame them.
__label__5	The Cliff Dr location has fantastic pharmacists. Negar, Emily, and Frank are all true professionals as well as courteous. I have been going there for 5 years and never had a problem. They recognize me, and always have a nice greeting as well. I've had vaccinations here too, and they are gentle and professional.
__label__4	I am uncertain as to the name of this dish, but my best friend and I split it so we didn't get too full and can enjoy walking the quarters for lunch without being food drunk. The food was light, delicious. Tasty, flavorful, the steak was cooked medium to perfection and the veggies were perfectly tender yet firm. We will be back
__label__5	FINALLY we have a shave ice in Nola! It's pretty decent and tasty! Love the bingsu! Fresh fruits! Presentations is looks delicious and gorgeous! Everything very refreshing! Most like will come back every time I'm in the westbank! Staffs are super friendly and helpful!
__label__3	"It's hard to like fast food.

But any fast food chain that serves biscuits and gravy is alright in my book."
__label__5	Worth the drive, but don't come here expecting more breakfast foods than beignets and coffee.
__label__5	Great place for when you need time to think and reflect. I feel inspired when I'm leaving. Some kind of way they've managed to be busy and quiet at the same time. When God had coffee shops in mind this is what He was thinking. Mucho Gusto Cherry.
__label__3	Not worth the price of admission, it's 15 dollars per person but it's a one story art gallery,sure theirs different types of art to look at but I recommend somewhere bigger for that price a good example is the Dali museum
__label__3	"i like the name of this place and the names they give their drink.. 
but i have to admit. its not soo great..
i got something dragon? 
it was red bean and pearl with MILK. not even milk tea..
make sure you read the description CLEARLY before ordering!"
__label__3	We went for brunch. The building, music and huge amount of space are all positives. The service is nil. We got our own water, coffee & had to bring our food upstairs ourselves. No problem but seems a bit pricey for no service. The food was good overall. The coffee was not so good, at least to me. My husband got a delicious dish that I got to share - The Hatchery - it was in a coconut-flavored sauce with fry bread. Super flavorful. The gift shop has great Nashville treats. Fun spot.
__label__2	Well, I just came into Dave&busters and got booted out for there new policy on having someone 25 and older Accompany someone that is younger. Talked to the manager and explained I drove an hour to get here and did not know the new policy. She politely let me through with my girlfriend that is 20. I sat down at the bar and ordered buffalo wings they came out microwaved. The ranch was hot. The celery was hot. Not good. Shame on them. Overall bad experience here and I really love Dave and busters.
__label__3	"I am by no means a Dive Bar person. I mean yes I do enjoy going to the occasional dive bar, hanging out, listening to music, and getting cheap drinks (which B&B does very well, i.e the special) But when I think of it, it just seemed like a normal bar to me. The band was good but not like ""OMG I CAN DIE NOW"" good.  However, if you're into Dive Bars, this is prob one of the best spots in the city."
__label__5	Variety of bbq is fantastic. Service is exceptional. Told the cashier that I was retired military(20 yrs) and got a free dessert with a thank you for your service. Pulled pork was not dry and had a real smoky flavor. 6 sauces are available at every table. Going back to try their ribs. A must place for bbq foodie!
__label__5	Bakersfield has the best margaritas in town. Plus the service is impeccable. Mike was impressive - a water glass never went empty, he checked to see if we needed anything even when it was busy and he could have easily forgotten. It's the little details that go a long way in the restaurant business and they do everything right. Give Mike a RAISE
__label__4	This has to be some of the best hamburgers I have ever tasted. The turkey burger had great flavor and the sweet potato fries were some of the best I have ever tasted. Everything was fresh. The restaurant has a great atmosphere. I will definitely be back.  Besides burgers, they have chicken sandwiches and salads. The helping was huge.
__label__4	Honest guys. Took my car in for squealing front brakes and they fixed them in about an hour. Wesley (the owner) did tell me about another problem with my rear brakes and broke down the price for me. A little pricey for me, but what's a girl to do when her regular mechanic is out of town.
__label__2	First time eating here.  Was expecting much more than what we got.  Waitress couldn't have been any more ignorant or miserable.  Food was mediocre at best.  Two people in my party had prime rib, ordered medium rare and came well done. Mash potatoes and vegetables had no flavor.  Won't be back.
__label__3	"Good, but not that good. Early in the day you can get the fresh macaroons for the day but into the evening you'll get the stale leftovers. When you pay an arm and a leg for macaroons, you expect to get something that doesn't have the consistency of cardboard. I've gone here twice and both times I thought ""why don't I just go upstairs to The Pub and get a beer for the price of this?"""
__label__3	"New restaurant in town. This is comparable to crackle barrel/rubys diner. As soon as you walk in it is a dark, loud ambiance. I did not mind the noise but they should have better lighting. They have a homestyle comfort food menu. They offer breakfast and dinner options. They are all very big portions.
The food was good but it was way to big of a portion size. Prices were decent. It was worth a first try"
__label__5	"This bar was attached to my hotel but actually pretty damn cool. First, the seating inside was split between a bar, and a fair amount of cool couches you could sit on with friends.

Second, they make some killer cocktail called a cobbler that uses all natural ingredients, in fact you can ask for a Mint Julep here and they'll crust the mint in front of you.

Third, you can smoke cigars outside at your leisure in super cozy seating."
__label__4	Food and service are terrific. Quaint, though limited, patio seating. Croissants and home made jam are a must try.
__label__4	Greatest place to shop in town . There's something for everyone . I shopped my entire Xmas list at this place and everyone was surprised at the cool things they received as a gift . I love their wine selections along with their imported foods . Staff is friendly !!
__label__4	Wow! This place is awesome! I've eaten here three times, and the food is great! Service is a little slow, waiters would walk by and look at us, while we sat there. We sat there maybe 10 mins before someone actually acknowledged us. But, we're patient, so we waited. Salsa is KILLER. We love it and will continue to come back!
__label__5	Best Southern food in Nashville. You can order anything and still leave with a happy belly and a huge smile. If it's your first visit, you must (I repeat MUST) try the biscuits with some peach preserves. I'm salivating just thinking about it!
__label__5	"Ashley was awesome. Super fast, attentive and friendly! 

Chef Chris kept it entertaining and made sure we had everything we needed!

Great experience. We'll be back soon!"
__label__1	Please promote healthier foods and meals! Balance your menus with healthier foods and put your customers' well-being first.
__label__1	The worst service I've ever had. If you're not a regular or under 30, they don't care to even give you a beverage.
__label__5	"This place has really good food. Their flight of salsa is super delicious, and their chips come straight out of the fryer. 
The service was also awesome, our server was on top of everything and the manager checked on our table a few times."
__label__2	Lattes are horrible. They tasted like drip coffee with flavored cream. It's surprising that this place is so highly rated on yelp! The breakfast sandwiches were decent. The guy meticulously packed the sandwiches for to-go. He salvaged (2 stars)  with the sandwiches. We won't be surprised  of this place shuts down in the future. You cannot be a coffee place and serve folgers coffee in a cup
__label__5	I had great service today.  Greeted when entered the store, fast friendly service.  Clean restaurant.  Just what you would expect from this chain
__label__5	Dr. Park is very attentive to his patients and very knowledgeable about dentistry. He tries to make his patients feel very  comfortable and the office is very welcoming.
__label__5	What a fun place with great beer. We stopped by with a couple of friends, and it was the perfect place for a chill night. They have an inside and an outside area with a bar inside and outside. The outside area has seating but does close earlier than the inside. The beers are reasonably priced and all of the ones we tried were so good. Prices are reasonable and great service!
__label__5	Dr. Bucky is the most intelligent and kind doctor I have ever encountered.  He listens to his patients and truly cares whole heartedly.  On top of that his expertise as a top notch surgeon can't be matched.  He used the perfect implants for me as a brca2 patient who did a double mastectomy and I feel completely myself again.  My results are beautiful and I wouldn't ever go to another plastic surgeon! Pure genius, skill, and bedside manner!
__label__4	This place is a nice modern restaurant.  They have allot of variety of sushi that was pretty good.  It's not a very big place so you get more of a personal experience.  Our server was fast and efficient.  It's not my top fav, but you won't be disappointed if you end up here.
__label__4	I stopped here while visiting my cousin at Penn on my way from D.C. up to Bucks County and enjoyed a great lunch and a pint of Dogfish Head.  The service was friendly, the soup was great, and you can't go wrong with Dogfish.
__label__3	I needed a drink, that's all. The drive through was efficient. I ordered a medium Pepsi. I waited in line for about a minute and forty seconds and paid money, got drink with a smile from a guy covered in tattoos.  All in all a fair exchange.
__label__5	This is the place to go for a cocktail and atmosphere. I love the vibe. The velvet curtains and library feel when you walk in make you feel like you are really transformed back in time. The drinks are great and the food is limited but tasty. You will want to have a reservation or be prepared to wait. It's the perfect romantic date night spot.
__label__5	The lobster rolls were perfect. Sat at the outside bar and ordered a couple martinis. They had live music on Saturday afternoon, I think they have live music everyday but I could be wrong. Good atmosphere at the bar.
__label__5	Yes Harold Seltzer's Steakhouse is one of the best. Great food, great wait staff, you won't be disappointed when you eat here!!
__label__5	Great service and food!!! I was visiting from NYC and they made my family and I feel very welcomed. I have food allergies and they were very accommodating to make sure I can enjoy my meal and be safe. Cheesesteaks were amazing!! Thanks again. We will visit again when in Philly!
__label__4	"I took my scion TC in and sold it to them within 30minutes. Fast and friendly service. I knew I wasn't going to get much for my car. I was a little busted up and the AC was broke. Was like rolling around in a sweatshop!?

They gave me $500 more than I was expecting. They did not hassle me about buying another vehicle. One of the better Carmax's I have visited."
__label__1	Worst place on the entire planet. Rude employees and y'all hire drug addicts, so that's why. Dirty place, dirty people,,, this is where it's at!
__label__5	I've been in the mortgage business for 25 years. The Gales team are one of the very best I've done business with. If you want professional service with your best interest at heart this is your real estate team.
__label__3	Service was great...excellent!! Food was okay but pricey. Will be back for the service and atmosphere.
__label__4	Called Joe'S Butcher Shop to see if they carried short ribs in which I wanted it sliced thin for Korean style BBque. Was able to place my order over the phone and picked it up later that afternoon. I was told that I was able the short ribs meaty .. Was not disappointed !! Came in and picked up ordered .. seamlessly with Covid restrictions in place ..
__label__5	With Covid-19 happening I am hesitant when going out to eat, but I was craving sushi really bad. I called ahead and was told about their special when ordering one roll they gave you a free appetizer Wow! They are currently not allowing but I'm totally fine with that. The staff was great they all had masks on and gloves. This assured me that they don't just care about making money but they do care about their staff and customers. Thanks for being awesome will be going back again.
__label__5	"Great food! I never liked hot & sour soup until I came here - it's worlds away from anything I've had in Chinese food restaurants.

Obviously it's far away from most of Tucson, but really is a great choice if you're in the area."
__label__2	I've been twice, and each time, I wasn't blown away. I wanted to like this place, but I just found it to be mediocre. There wasn't a lot of flavour in my meal, and I didn't love the textures. My drink was good though.
__label__4	Really special local eatery with yummy natural food and drinks. Organic juices, locally roasted coffee, and a cool space to hang out made this place our lunch time oasis while visiting.
__label__5	"I wish I remembered the name of the guy who served us!!! Excellent customer service. I was hesitant at first because I can't really handle ice cream. He informed me of the vegan options and the chocolate dip is also vegan! He readily explained each flavor to me! He even helped my friend find parking! Sheesh! So yummy! Can't wait to go back! 

Amazing concept!"
__label__4	Great little spot to hang out or to njoy massive coke floats!!! Music wuz not to loud and that prices were available
__label__5	"This place is a hidden gem. I didn't even notice it for a long time but in my quest for some specialty health foods I found The Healthy Food Cafe. 

I started juicing for health reasons and this place is a juice and smoothie Mecca! 

Not just that but it has a vast food menu to. 
Lots of gluten free, vegan, ketogentic, and paleo diet friendly options! 

And last but not least they offer meal prep! Tell them what you need and they can make your daily meals in advance to keep your diets on track!"
__label__5	Love beignets! Cute little place in Kenner...cafe au lait. Cozy and comfy. Great service and wonderful experience for out of town guests.Cafe Au   Beignet's
__label__4	Good Mexican Resturant. Excellent service. The salsa is better than usual, has a nice smoky flavor. The chicken Torta was very good as was the Burrito Michoacán.   We liked that they have both refeied and black beans, both were tasty.   The queso fundido was atypical, it didn't use cheese dip/sauce but had actual melted cheese and was more suited to eating with a tortilla than chips.
__label__1	This place is terrible ,the food was so bad I didn't even eat it. I  ordered the enchiladas and they didn't come with any sauce which I've never heard of before the tortillas were stale and the meat was dry and flavorless ..And the service was just as bed the server seen I didn't eat my food and still charged me for it.I wouldn't let my dog eat in this place ..
__label__2	Not the best not the worst. The help was friendly and it looked clean but the Slices ordered were cold. I ordered two and they were both Luke warm.
__label__5	If you haven't had a sandwich from here you haven't lived! I must admit I do love each one I have eaten.  So hard to say I have a favorite.  Thank you for excellent menu items, you are a huge step above ALL other's! Your employee's super too! Again thank you for my happy face & tummy!!!
__label__5	No, you aren't going to be impressed with the ambiance of this place and they won't offer you a latte, but it's a tire shop so who cares? Great service, honest and crazy good prices.  Under 30 minutes to install 4 tires, are you kidding me?  That's like NASCAR speed.  Last time I went to a tire shop for 4 tires it literally took them all day.  Skip the fancy tire shops and just go here.
__label__1	First time I've been here in a few years and I can't say that I'll ever come back. The lobby looks nice. The theater it's self is trashed. It's difficult to be comfortable because it's so hot. It smells bad. The chairs do not recline. The theater clearly wasn't cleaned beforehand either. I am horrified.
__label__2	It was decent. We ordered the antipasto, which there was too much of and the meat was low quality in taste. The pizzas were bland and I just can't think of a great reason to return. I was very disappointed because I love Noble Hops and since they are owned by the same people I had high hopes for this place.
__label__1	After a long delay, they sent out the salad with the meal and mixed up the order. The restaurant was not busy and the manager did not stop by the table.
__label__1	I have to agree with the bad reviews for the pharmacy.  This place is a hot mess! Extremely slow, they NEVER answer the phone. There is always some issue with your prescription when ordering through their app, so I always have to go inside to get it straightened out. And then there's more waiting in line and more waiting for your prescription to be ready. Overall, not the friendliest staff back there either. I'm going to be transferring my prescription to another Walgreens. By far the worst pharmacy I've encountered in all my years.  Definitely do not recommend!
__label__4	Revisited this place a few nights ago for dinner with friends. Used to order sushi for delivery when I went to school years back. Definitely did not disappoint! Sushi was very good, rolls weren't obnoxiously large that you have to cram into your mouth, nigiri was some of the freshest I've had in St Louis. Wait staff was kind and checked on our table at appropriate intervals. Parking is sparse, but there is a parking garage next door that usually has open spots on the second level-first level is for tenants living in the apartment buildings.
__label__5	"I take all 3 of my boys here. Jack is a master barber, and he's hilarious. It's always busy, but it doesn't matter. I sit and listen to the music and the jokes all of the barbers are telling. Great place and great dudes.

Make an appointment, they are busy!!!"
__label__5	My beautiful wife Julie and I love to come here and celebrate when I close an escrow. We always get the same things. Julie gets the Cheeseburger and I get the Duck burger. They are both awesome and we always bring a great bottle of Pinot Noir. The setting and the atmosphere are both great, the food superb, and the service is first rate (ask for Carole, she is delightful!).
__label__3	I've had a decent experience at this place, it's right next to my place so I can walk home after having a few beers. I've only had bad experiences on Monday's. The bartender on Monday nights seems like he hates his job and always has a sour face on.  Thankfully he only works on Mondays so I would recommend this place but not on Monday's.  The California Burger is delicious and you can get it on Thursdays for $6.00.
__label__5	Great food and drinks! Brooklyn makes a wicked good martini. We really enjoyed the live music, Wicked Bad Girls and a Guy.
__label__4	Great local breakfast place in old Victorian.  Both friends had eggs benedict and said they were fine but nothing to write home about.  I had the club which was Delicious!!!  Service was super friendly and prompt.  A very dog friendly spot.  I did think the restrooms were inadequate for the size of the place but it is an old house.
__label__5	Good food!! Everything is seasoned well, I especially loved my herb crusted grouper. Will be returning for more good meals!
__label__5	"We came for lunch, so I can't rate the rooms...but the food was great and the view was unbeatable.  

We had a wonderful server, she was very attentive and helpful.  My dad had the lobster sandwich, thankfully he shared it w/me- it was as good as some that I've had in Maine- really delicious. I had the mozzarella sandwich, which was also very tasty, but go for the lobster!  Good soups as well."
__label__5	"I was extremely nervous as I found I had to get my two top wisdom teeth extracted as well as two cavities. 

As I walked in the office for my appointment, i expressed my concern but in exchange I was reassured that the process would be quick and easy.

Dr. Brosnan was great. He walked me through everything he was doing. I barely felt a thing except a little pressure and the whole process was done in less than 30 mins ( including cavities ).

I would definitely return!"
__label__3	It's OK.  If you go to Ching Garden 2, get some of the sushi or sashimi.  Anything from the sushi counter is about excellent!  For some reason, the traditional American Chinese fare just isn't as good as their other location Ching Garden.  That business, just North of this one on State Road 135, makes better entrees.
__label__5	Libby is a wizard with color! I have some awful, stubborn grey and she gets all of it!She does a fantastic job! The salon is friendly and inviting. Everyone is very down to earth. Highly recommend!
__label__5	"My deja brew was amazing and delicious.
Great customer service and there wasn't much of a wait."
__label__5	I visit Straubs almost every day and on many days a few times. They aren't as cheap as your Dierbergs or Schnucks, but I pay more for the ease of shopping here - your in and out, the quality of the food (deli, meat, and to go meals are the best in town), and if you are looking for that weird ingredient for that random recipie, they never seem to disappoint. Plus, when I seem to go daily, less food seems to go to waste then making a big shopping trip every week.
__label__2	The food is okay, not that great. And it takes FOREVER. We have tried multiple times, and it was a two hour process every time. It was 20 mins before we even get drinks. The food isn't worth the wait, we won't be back. Waitresses are nice!
__label__5	Just had a great stay at the inn this weekend, great room in the Umpleby House, great room, #9, top floor.Great bagels this morning, thanks Carl and Nadine.
__label__5	This place is AMAZING!!! I hate oysters and I tried these and they were yummy and the sauce was even better! I also got the shrimp and corn bisque and shrimp and grits! They also give you tons of shrimp! I'd highly recommend this place! The service was top notch! Nicholas went above and beyond!
__label__2	"Was probably one of the worst experiences I had in a nice restaurant.  My wife was pregnant at the time so we did not drink.  The wait service had us out in 35 minutes.  That included appetizer, meal and dessert.

We didn't have tome to enjoy and felt rushed the entire time.  I felt like I was at Red Robin on a Weekend.   Hurry up and change over the table.

Food was good.  But based on the experience, I will not go back."
__label__3	"So I had enough time to wait on my food to write the review, and I am sitting at the bar !!! That should tell you a lot about tikis service! 
The drinks - Loved the redrum sangria ! We decided to get another round ! 
Food- limited menu, but if you order at 6 pm you will get to eat by 6:45. The food is good we had the chicken dumplings. But the limited menu is a major turn off. 
I would say, stop by tiki before you go to Lolita or jamonera !"
__label__4	Our first visit here was with a large group. The staff were a tad overwhelmed, but friendly. The food was great. Lots of choice and tasty too. We have since been back with a smaller group and found things a little less chaotic.
__label__1	Very disapointed by thier customer serviece in handling a battery that died within a year. Had to get a new battery and they said I'm on my own, for a battery that only made it to 8000 miles. Do not expect any support from them after they give you the keys. I would look elsewhere.
__label__5	"Incredible. From the wine selection to the mixed cocktails, everything was fantastic. The pastel se chocola was the best I have ever had. It will be hard to choose what to order when you look at menu.


Enjoy."
__label__5	"I've ordered king cakes from Haydels and have never been disappointed. 

Because everything about my destination wedding in New Orleans was unique and culturally relevant to my roots, I opted for a king cake in lieu of a traditional white fancy cake. 

The ease in ordering from a distance was spectacular. It was easy to reach someone via phone or email and I received quick responses.  

The cake was fun in pictures and a sweet alternative to the norm for my out of town guests."
__label__5	Food is good and at good price. We ordered arepas, tequenos and costillas, and all of them are great! Definitely recommend it to anyone!
__label__1	I've never seen my wife spit out food until I came here. I also had to spit my food in a napkin. No Way can't do it
__label__5	Love this place. I like the loud atmosphere and the whole vibe of the place. The food is great and the service is great.
__label__5	Usually if your dealing with an auto body place , it's not a great thing because it means u were in an accident or had some type of damage to your vehicle, but this place makes it a Very enjoyable & painless experience! I have been dealing with Keenan for approx. 10 years now & they've been great every time! VERY HELPFUL. They go above & beyond to make your experience a good one. After dealing w/ A less adequate place before them , it makes me Apprecciate them even more ! The body work is excellent along with great customer service.
__label__5	"Great boutique hotel. Very close to the beach on one side and restaurants on the other side. 
Parking is free and so is wifi. 
The rooms are fully renovated and are tastefully decorated. We stayed here in the beginning of May and had a great time. The staff is friendly and helpful. 
I highly recommend this place."
__label__4	Bar Review: One of the most comprehensive beer lists I've seen in a while. No mass produced beer here, just domestic microbrews and imports. Where else can you have a beer from Iceland (which was fantastic by the way)? The tap list is small but well represented with regional microbrews. It's very much a beer lover's bar, and I plan on coming back to try the food.
__label__5	Great local bar! Has a great happy hour and laid back feel! Their quesadillas and fries and queso are a must try!
__label__3	I have been coming here for quite some time and have ordered out several times.This is the first time I have ordered an extra large and when I got it I noticed it was in the same container as my large has been.I went back in and talked to one of the employees and she pointed out to me the the difference between a large and extra large.I ran into the owner and he confirmed what the employee said to me.I have included pictures.The food is great but just don't order the extra large pho for $2.00 more.
__label__5	THIS IS A MUST!!!! Hands down my favorite activity in Nashville. It was just myself and my boyfriend but then we got grouped up with another couple and bachelorette party. Everyone had a blast! Our driver, Dustin, was hilarious and made sure everyone had a drink at all times. They also offered drink specials when we made the two bar spots. I honestly would have booked this again had I known how fabulous it was going to be!!
__label__4	I was starving on a long drive that took me through Nashville.  I stopped here and was pleasantly surprised.  The food and service were very good.
__label__5	What a wonderful spot to take in the local flavor. The food is so good and the service really fantastic. If your in the area you should really consider this great spot.
__label__5	The facilities are always clean. They have a lot of great free classes and the childcare is amazing. My kids love going there.
__label__4	"This Safeway is awesome. Has a lot of baked options. Let me tell you, these bakers know how to bake. Everything I need is here. Decent amount of options, even healthy foods. Carry some brand options that are found at more expensive food like Sprouts. Hot food also has a good selection. Only thing I don't like is the produce 
isn't that great of quality for what you pay for it."
__label__3	Neat atmosphere.  Service was good. average at best food.  The wife and I had the pulled pork dinner.  Baked beans taste like canned bush baked beans.  Root beer is home made...they probably should get out of the root beer business.  The pork was ok.
__label__4	"Our favorite go to place on Mondays -- free parking, $3 craft beers and $0.65 wings (not many flavors but what they have rocks) and free pool Monday.  Each day has a special so it's a good place to stop in. 

The one drawback for us is that it not a smoke-free bar. But the staff ensures you have a good time, the patrons are nice and the food is tasty."
__label__5	Food is incredible. People and atmosphere are also both great. You get what you pay for. Plenty of food for the price. You will not be hungry afterwards. My with and I try to get their food at least once a week. Can't say enough about how good they are. Highly recommend them.
__label__5	A great place with an awesome atmosphere! I am not a fan of seafood so I cannot speak for that aspect but my boyfriend had the fried grouper sandwich and I think he would have gotten 2 if he could! We also had the mozzarella squares which were different and yummy!
__label__1	Only because I had to . On Veterns day 2015. Everything about this was a bad experience  over cooked eggs under cooked hash browns, no refill, no check. Ugh!
__label__4	This place is wonderful with delicious food. Though pricey it's totally worth it. Is great and nice atmosphere.
__label__1	Trying to reach someone in customer service, by phone. On hold 10 minutes so far...............not good.
__label__1	We just walked out of the kitchen bar. we were sitting there with our menus and a waitress kept on walking past us and not making eye contact. we waited seven minutes and left. this is not the first time that we have had horrible service at this restaurant.  if someone takes your order you have to wait at least a half an hour for the food.  we did not wait for the food which is usually mediocre at best. We live in the neighbourhood but we will not be going in that restaurant ever again
__label__3	The food is pretty good but for the amount it is really overpriced. Their menu can be confusing and even after spending quite a bit of money u can go home hungry. And the wait staff tends to hover.
__label__5	LOVE this place!! Great atmosphere/decor and delicious food. The Korean fried chicken was AMAZING and I'm still thinking about it days later!
__label__1	Order two lunch beef and broccoli beef looks beat up rice are hard to chew and price ain't cheat for lunch  will never go again
__label__5	Dr. Barone and her staff is awesome. I have always been very nervous about going to the dentist but after my first visit with her I will never be nervous again. She is very caring and makes you feel very comfortable.  She takes her time and explains everything and gives you different options.   If your looking for a new dentist definitely give her a call.
__label__2	"The coffee was ok but not amazing. Sadly the service turned us off before we even got our coffee. It feels like this is a ""regulars"" place... New people aren't welcome. It's small and does offer food, but the gentleman manning the register this Saturday afternoon was simply rude, dismissive and obviously annoyed that we were even there. Given the great service we usually have in the area we will pick someplace else next time."
__label__5	What's not to like. Nice outdoor seating that allows my dog. They have some great sweets as well.
__label__3	Purchased a new unit from hales and the installers were great.  Good,  clean,  superb work.  The unit had issues a few months later and the service tech that arrived to repair the unit have a very bad attitude.  Got very frustrated and annoyed with any type of questions I would ask.  The unit was fixed and is in good working order.
__label__5	Wonderful outdoor seating and food options. We especially enjoyed some Austrian wine (grüner Veltliner) and had a great time. Ordering several smaller plates and sharing it all was fun.
__label__1	"We have tried this dominos twice in the past month. The first time we placed an order for pick up. They messed up the order and ended up having to remake it while we waited... forgivable. However, manager was observed texting and then continued making pizzas without washing hands.
Gave them a second chance tonight for delivery and the order arrived 30 minutes after the quoted time. The boxes were saturated with grease. 
Definitely one if the worst Dominos we've ever used."
__label__5	I've always wanted Korean BBQ, and this place definitely did not disappoint! The food was so good, and I loved using the grill to cook everything. Also, our waiter Clyde was the man, he made sure we had everything we needed :)
__label__1	Way over priced and not good. 2nd time my wife and I came here. Last time we were disappointed but decided to give it another chance. We were let down again! Service is great though. But for the prices they are charging, the food is sub par. And the coffee was the worst I've ever had at a breakfast spot. We won't be coming back, literally any other breakfast spot in SB is better, and most are cheaper as well.
__label__5	I was here as a tourist wanting to get some prints of Rocky and the Philadelphia Art Museum and I noticed much of what I wanted was already framed for low prices. I was unsure of what to get so Bob Utkor the owner packed a deal for me so I could get the 3 items, (framed) that I wanted. I was very pleased with what this gallery had to offer and how Bob allowed me to get what I wanted at a low price.
__label__5	The flavors of the food are amazing. I was there for breakfast, had the short ribs chili and fresh squeezed grapefruit juice- absolutely wonderful!
__label__4	Everything a diner should embody- mom and pop vibe, quaint, personable service, good price, and great breakfast. I ordered a crab omelette with home fries and an English muffin, which overall was tasty. However, it wasn't exactly what I expected and nothing over the top amazing. But, nonetheless break was good and a fair serving portion. Arrived on a Saturday early afternoon and my party of three was seated within 10 mins. The diner was full, but food turn around was quick. Service was great. Great brunch option in Seminole Heights.
__label__2	We absolutely love this place.... but today we sat at the bar to eat and have a few drinks and our bartender? Dean was the most unfriendly and rude person I have ever had wait on me. He never smiled and rarely spoke to anyone, it was hard to tell if he really heard you order until he showed back up 10 minutes later with your drink. Again our food was fantastic but the service was horrendous.
__label__2	"Like a lot of other reviews have mentioned, it's not enough food for the price. My entire dish was lukewarm, with a few bites actually being cold. I got ""medium"" spice which was not spicy at all (I'm convinced they just forgot to put any)."
__label__5	Really great menu! I ordered the jerk chickan with Jialo Rice and Plantains. It was excellent comfort food. The Jerk seasoning was very flavorful and the rice was great! Can't wait to go back!
__label__5	"This place rocks.  I asked the concierge at the Westin what the best local favorite restaurant was in town.  Without any hesitation, he said, ""Cochon"".  
Walked over there from the hotel and it was packed.  Staff was very accomodating and nice.  We sat at the bar and the service was excellent.  Drinks at the bar, great food (had 6 items off the menu), all for $75 bucks, how can you go wrong?  
From an out of towners perspective, this truly is the best restaurant in NO!!"
__label__4	Checked this place out because of the show 3D. Food taste great and service is awesome.  Def a place to take your family.
__label__2	While we have enjoyed this place in the past, the OMG was good, my skillet was not.  The eggs where fluffy and light but the potatoes were hard  and did not seem fresh.  I had to send back the vanilla chi ice tea!   Not mixed well and gritty.  Servers were wonderful and took care of the tea right away, I was very disappointed.
__label__5	"SoFresh- So expensive as well!!!!  
If you are into eating well, feeling energetic and wants to about at all cost the many fast food chain restaurants that we have around us, come to SoFresh. 
Very confusing menu, BUT the guy at the register was very good at explaining it and making it simpler!!!
I went for the power bowl and that was the best choice!!!!!
Again, if you don't mind spending $20 for a healthy plate and being hungry 2 hours after!!!! Come to SoFresh"
__label__5	My first trip to EVO Motors I was less than impressed, but after the customer service manager reached out to me I decided to go back for a second time. You could say it went well because today I walked out a Lexus owner! I was taken care of by a few of the staff members, all equally amazing. But most of the work was done by Joe who took very good care of me. He's hands down the best employee there. Give him a raise.
__label__4	"Excellent build a hash, cool vibe, and large portions.

Their jelly that comes with the toast is super good as well.

Only negs are there is always a long slow line at the register, and it can be really cold inside/outside in the AM."
__label__4	"BellaVita would be a wonderful addition to any town, it's got all of what it takes -
delightfully fresh Italian food, friendly service, and, the prices are reasonable.
I could go on and on about the fried eggplant, the smoked cheese, the tomato gravies, roasted peppers, roasted cauliflower, shrimp scampi.... but why not just close your eyes and pick anything on the menu, you can not go wrong in this place, it's delicious from one end of the menu to the other."
__label__4	"My husband and I went here last week for breakfast! It was super tasty. The food was well portioned and was really filling. Their bacon was like no other. My husband got the burger and fries and he loved it. He said the burger was very juicy. 
Also the service is very quick. Which I was kind of worried about because when we arrived there was a long wait."
__label__5	Amazing food! I had the blacked grouper dinner with rice and green beans, everything was cooked beautifully! My wife had the scallops with rice they were cook perfectly. I wish they would had put a little lemon on it or plated a lemon but it was very very good.
__label__5	Nice surprise to find this spot. The menu is on the board, order at the counter then find a table. Inside and outside seating. Friendly staff.
__label__4	"To Eric B: We don't take our kids to bars. They had no interest in
beer and espresso when they were 2yrs old. Take them to IHop."
__label__1	Waited in line over 40 mins. When I got the food fries were cold and stale, burgers were cold, buns were hard and stale. Barely edible... I wouldn't feed this to my dog. Getting so sick and tired of shit service. and these people want $15 and hour... give me a break. Absolutely pathetic. Won't be wasting my time or money at this joke of a restaurant again.
__label__4	I occasionally grab lunch from Edible Alchemy. They have a friendly staff, and the mac and cheese with leeks (sans bacon) is the perfect comfort food with a twist.
__label__2	"Terrible attention to detail. Lots of crumbs left on my carpet and dust on the dash. Water spots all over my side mirrors and parts of the windows. The young men drying and cleaning the car were so involved in their own conversations and laughing- no one checked with me to make sure I was satisfied or even said Thank You. I will
Never be back. For $32 car should've been a bit more perfect."
__label__3	Buenos como todo buffet mucha comida rica...pero siempre hay que observar que la comida se vea fresca quese note que siempre se esté  cambiando contante mente siempre que vaya a un buffet hay que oservar bien
__label__4	"This was the first time that I ate here and I honestly would come back. Walking into the restaurant as very welcoming both by the decor and the workers there. The place itself was very lively and clean which i personally enjoyed. Ordering was quick and easy. 

Food: I ordered the Salmon Kabob with pita chips and roasted vegetables ($12-13).This was the perfect meal after working out and sat very well in my stomach. The meal was brought to the table and had great presentation.

I would come back again, especially for the healthy meal (they include the calories on the menu)."
__label__5	Awesome food, service, and great prices!   Will definitely be back- try the onion rings- they literally fell from heaven
__label__5	Had an appointment today. Received great service from all staff members. Especially from Nancy working the front desk. She was amazing and so helpful when I had questions. Thank you Nancy and all of Pritchell care staff!
__label__1	Terrible experience at this location.  They gave away my sandwich to another customer and after informing them that I had not received my sandwich 10 minutes after getting my coffee, they showed no urgency and took another 15 minutes to put my sandwich into the heat....
__label__1	"DONT USE!!!!SCAM Alert!!!! My AC unit died and Horizon came out within 4 hours. The tech said my motor died and referred me to the sales rep. The sales rep arrived at 9 pm stayed til 11:00pm with pricing for a new AC. 15 K. I called local HVAC next day repair for electrical part 450.00. Quote for new unit next spring 8k.  Rip off!!!!

Kathleen saboski Trenton NJ"
__label__1	Long wait. Host moved slow and disinterested.My food was terrible. Green beans too hot with pepper. Stuffed shrimp were not fresh. Crabmeat dressing processed.  Definitely would not return or recommend
__label__3	"I'd much rather ride the Septa than hang out in a Septic Tank, but that's just me.

This station is directly across from Pops Water Ice in the heart of Old South Philly. It's pretty safe here but at the same time be careful if you're by yourself, especially when it's late night."
__label__3	Wine is pretty bland, but meritage is at least balanced. Decent value. Pretzel bread is really good (throw some table salt on it).
__label__5	Used a & l to repair our fridge.  Keith was out within 30 mins and repaired.  Fast service and professional.  Obviously been doing this a long time.  Saved hundreds of dollars worth of food from spoiling.  VERY pleased
__label__4	Nice environment. The food is typically top notch. Love the chicken kabobs! Usually there is something that is  complementary and quite good.
__label__4	I was pleasantly surprised. The food, service and place was nice on a weekday eve. Like it!
__label__5	Purchased some delicious crabs to supplement our catch in the bayou. Very well-seasoned and fresh!
__label__3	Barely a three star! The food is average at best. We had the chicken Parmesan which was decent. The lasagna was also okay and the meatballs. However, the chicken picatta should have been pounded out thin. Now, the spaghetti is soft and way over cooked and the sauce tasted like it was from a jar. Expected way more. The ambiance was nice, old style, but still nice.
__label__5	The rolls were delicious! Vegan tempura sushi was soooo yummy! Texture, taste and blend of veggies were exceptional. I didn't like the veggie tempura appetizer, just thick with batter, wasn't good. I would definitely eat sushi here again!
__label__3	I was visiting St. Louis and was told to try the local pizza. I came here hoping to get a slice, but they only sold pizza by the pie. Sadly, I didn't get to try the pizza, but the kale salad was yummy!
__label__5	Bought the InfaRed Sauna through Groupon and it's been great. The staff is amazing.
__label__5	"What a fun store, especially for this newbie runner who cannot seem to commit to a regular running regiment.  

The store is always clean and the service is always knowledgable and helpful without being pretentious or arrogant.  I have not used their fitting service, but only because I don't consider myself a hardcore runner.  Given that I am running more, it might be time to go in and let them do their thing."
__label__5	"Beautiful view and great food and staff! The drinks were super delicious as well. We choose to go here for my small 40th birthday and had such a great time.

Also the ahi tuna was the biggest I miss delicious I've ever had at a restaurant."
__label__1	Food was horrible, no taste at all. Had better Mexican food from tacos bell before. Very disappointed, came here on a recommendation from some friends and was not what I was expecting at all
__label__2	Was just okay. They did a nice job but I didn't like the the individual who seemed to be the owner asked be to pay before I had gotten anything done. I found that odd.
__label__4	Pretty dang good Thai food!  The soups are huge and great to share as an appetizer. The meals were delicious (we had green curry and pad Thai). The service is excellent and the restaurant is clean and welcoming. We will be back!
__label__5	Best Pizza Hands  Down! This is our go-to place when we don't feel like cooking. Pizza is cooked perfectly and I always get the side of meatballs and the garlic knots. Quick service very nice drivers and tonight my grandchildren are enjoying it as well!
__label__5	My family had a great lunch on a weekday afternoon. The sandwiches and pizza were excellent. The service was great. It is a nice casual restaurant bar. We thought the food was great.
__label__5	So happy when ClusterTruck came to Broad Ripple. We were regulars when we lived downtown (see previous review). You can't find better food delivery anywhere not just in Indy but any major city in the Midwest. The food is freshly made they control the delivery and the prices are so reasonable. The food comes hot, delicious, and correct! Do yourself a favor stop using grub hub, door dash, or whatever else your using and stick to ClusterTruck if you are in any of their service areas.
__label__1	I won't be back. I was told it would be an hour. I waited on-site for almost 3 hours. When it was ready, I arrived to see bug guts and grass still stuck to the grill of my vehicle. Not to mention dirt still on the back bumper. After waiting so long, I just wanted to get out of there. The young man who checked me in and out was courteous.
__label__4	We have been going there for years. We invited some friends to go with us and said that their order was just ok. I must say that it wasn't up to par for us either. We know that Mama's is the best in Tarpon Springs. Just a little embarrassed since they think Hellas is better. We will be back for sure.
__label__1	Did an order here through the app and the order came quickly but was completely wrong, having toppings I didn't want on my burger and toppings I did want missing from my burger. I called to complain and when the lady who answered said she was the mgr was told what had happened, she said I must have ordered it wrong.... When I used my saved favorite order. I asked for her mgr and she refused to give me his # and refused to issue a refund. DO NOT EAT HERE. Terrible customer service all around.
__label__5	This place is almost perfect....great selection in sushi, and they deliver!!! I would posted a picture, but I ate my food so fast, because it was so good!!
__label__5	Love this place! Came here on Christmas Eve for lunch. Decor was beautiful. Food is amazing. Great burger!
__label__2	"1. Awesome service.

2. So so environment.

3. Ok food.

4. The dress is SUPER casual."
__label__1	I had an accident there and the customer service were poor. After they accidentally hit my face not even a discount on my food or my wine were offered. Very disappointed. Tostones were good, sangria not recommended.
__label__2	Services was ok. Lots of people working but not very efficient. Food was ok too.  Went to pay and stood there for several minutes before anyone came  their were about 1/2 dozen workers standing at kitchen window and several that came close to table by us and never said a word.
__label__5	My work husband and I grab lunch from here quite often! There is a wide variety of choices and the cashiers are very friendly. The only drawback is you cannot use your credit card here; cash only! But, that's standard in Chinatown. My go to is Honey Barbecue Pork - ask for double meat and for ginger sauce! Each entree is substantial and sometimes I even split one entree for both lunch and dinner on a busy day.
__label__4	Walked in 30 min before closing and the staff was super cool.  Pizza wise, there's a few better places in the area, but wasn't disappointed.  I'd go back if I was right there.  Only criticism I'd give is their crust needs another couple min on the stones.  But, that could be because I went in at closing....  definitely worth a stop
__label__5	I would live here if I could. Fresh warm bread baked served in a flower pot...and never tasted better. Eggplant toast was really flavorful! Service was wonderful. Love that they opened this location. Will definitely be back!
__label__2	When u go online they have a great view from the beach, thinking that there right on the beach.. but the building is behind the Hyatt hotel..  the rooms are not as good as u see it online..
__label__4	Always a relaxing and enjoyable experience! The champagne mimosa seasonal pedicure is divine! Jamie was wonderful, friendly and professional.  A new experience for me was the Scandal Candle....AMAZING!! This is a must try! I had to buy one to take home.  The hot rock massage with the candle oil was the best!
__label__5	The place we wanted to go had a 2 hour wait. So, this was a last minute choice. I had the fried chicken and gravy with collards greens and loaded bake potato. The chicken was moist and cook very well. The heavy was good. Just the right combination of spices. Not too salty.  The collard greens were very tender. There were little pieces of ham.  The flavor was just collard greens.  I liked the loaded bake potato. It was also cooked just right. It had a soft texture. A little fluffy, the skin was soft not overly cooked.
__label__5	Amazing quiche and mimosas! The service is friendly and fast. This is a great place to relax and enjoy.
__label__5	The staff at Animal Hospital of Northwood continue their terrific and caring service to  our furry family members even in the face of the COVID challenges.  Safety measures are excellent.
__label__5	Great food and a great atmosphere! The staff is very friendly. Would recommend the fried pickle appetizer and the grilled sandwich with pulled pork and Mac n cheese on it! Was a nice day out so we sat outside by the fireplace. Great time here.
__label__5	My #1 Gluten Free spot in Philly. Awesome happy hour specials, great staff and some of the best gf crust around. The staff doesn't treat me like a monster for asking for gf or if I ask for something more custom so I could eat it, it's terrific. This Zavino's is the better out of the two if your indecisive. I come here for mini dates w my wife and always leave happy.
__label__1	"Smells like piss. Not sure whether it's from their restroom or on the street. So called ""best burger"", just like a Big Mac. Free ranch chicken sandwich, is nothing but to put sliced bread, Cole slaw, and fried chicken piece from Jewel Osco together. I'm sorry, I'm just very disappointed in my first meal in Philly when I expected a 4 star taste like how the review is shown."
__label__5	The best jambalaya in all of New Orleans. I actually liked it better than the gumbo. It's loaded with meat and it's a very generous portion. It was worth the long wait in line.
__label__4	Loved my Huevos Rancheros! Fun atmosphere, good coffee. I'll definitely head here on my next trip to town.
__label__5	There was six of us stopping for lunch. We ate on the patio which was lovely, but we also admired the interior which was warm and inviting. We shared two pizzas: the caciotta and the vegetali plus the penne with salmon. All were delicious and of course we made room for dessert and we ordered all of them: the tiramisu, the chocolate mousse and the chocolate bites. All were spectacularly delicious. The ambience was lovely. The service was helpful and friendly. Definitely a place for all of us to return to.
__label__5	Finally poke in clayton and it's gooood!! Thanks lemon shark for opening in clayton!! The poke is so fresh and the sauces are very flavorful. Extra perk is the owner is super nice and very down to earth. We will be coming here often.
__label__4	"Zinburger is always a consistent thing lace for solid tasty burgers and sides along with good prices and selections of wine by the glass. 

Had the El Diablo and Sam's Burger.  Both very tasty along with fried zucchini."
__label__4	"Clean and well stocked. When we were in there some younger tweens/kids came in and the Manager asked them where their parents were. When they said they were alone, he asked them to leave. I didn't see anything ""locked up"" like prior reviewers said."
__label__2	The service I had here was horrible, it took about an hour to get my food.  The food was decent, but not worth the price tag. If you plan on getting miso soup or rice prepare to pay extra. I really felt this place tried rip every dollar out of you, having to pay $2.50 for white rice when ordering over $25 of sushi per person is more annoying than anything. Heavily disappointed by how frugal Ninja is. Would definitely recommend looking elsewhere if you want  sushi in New Orleans.
__label__1	Poor service and honestly not great food at all. Got the pad Thai, spicy sunken noodles and cashew chicken. I have to say big disappointment as we barely ate anything. My 4 yr old who loves pad Thai didn't eat more than 2 bites. The pad Thai tasted stale. Wouldn't recommend this place.
__label__5	If you come here, ask for Christy (I hope I spelled it correctly - I will check next time).  She is the absolute best.  Christy is very smiley and attentive.  She will remember your name and engage in very polite and cheerful conversation.  Christy does a superb job delivering whatever hair cut you wish for - I bring my children here and get my own hair cut each month from her.  You won't be disappointed.
__label__3	Sure I was hoping for more Spain in a tapas restaurant, but the charcuturie was excellent and the meal pretty good. The fact the place was dead empty while PM was packed doesn't make me want much to visit again. If only I could buy the lomo in bulk.
__label__5	"The rib roast for Christmas dinner was a triumph !  Now I have a butcher named Tony!  Since I'm not very technical savvy , I procrastinate a tech things, I returned to rhe shop and tried the Argentina marinade steak tips and the andoiule sausages.  Wow,  and wow! 
The sausage made a perfect addition to gumbo. Spicy, but not too hot.  Delish!
The steak tips were perfect.  A tender flavorful and easy to prepare lunch.  So tender I will ve using for my next company  meal, 
Can't wait to see Tony!"
__label__5	Awesome food service was great our waitor was amaizin food was awesome and restaurant was verry clean
__label__5	Fabulous find.  My wife and I ate here last night, had the trout and bison; both exceptional.  Service was superb.  Will be going back soon...
__label__4	My purple gel manicure turned out very well- she paid very close attention to detail and didn't rush me out like most places. The only reason I didn't give a 5 was because my nail tech buffed my nails to a pretty thin, weak point- next time I will ask for light filing and buffing.
__label__1	The amount of food they serve for the price is so little. If you get a chicken dish, they give you 4-5 small cubes of chicken. Like what. They charge over $10 for a dish and only 4 small cubes of chicken? And when I showed the waiter the little amount of meat, he said that's how it comes. Never going to this place.
__label__3	So-so Mexican food. I got enchiladas which were good, my husband got the mole chicken which basically had no taste. Don't think I'll be returning, I can make better food at home!
__label__4	Very very good!! Very delicious smoke burger. The lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pickles, and peppers all tasted super fresh!! The burger was juicy and my shake was delicious!! I think it is nice that they have beer, including two options that you can get in a pitcher.
__label__4	"Great place to chill and have fun! I love the drinks! The wide-list of flavors gives you a chance to try on something new or different in any given day. The staff are polite, smiley, and fun. Good worth and great place!

__label__5	My wife and I moved recently from NY, where we own a home used as a rental, to STL and were in need of expertise. Previous reviews encouraged me to contact Jean. I am so grateful I did! This an incredibly professional, friendly and well-versed office. I highly recommend giving them your business.
__label__2	This location has very slow service every time I go.   Luckily there are faster ones on the way to work.
__label__5	Our first attempt at Korean food.  Charming setting. EXCELLENT service. We were unsure of what to order but the flavors were delicious and we'll definitely be back.
__label__3	I realize you aren't hurting at all for business but seriously your hostess staff is snobby and act like they don't care. I arrived for an online order that didn't process. I had to sit and wait. The hostess brought it to me and dropped th bag next to me and didn't say thank you or apologize for my wait. Sorry I even left them a tip and won't again for take out. I've always had amazing service when dining in, both from the wait staff and the quality of the food.
__label__5	Some images of Prime Rib, Mac and Cheese, and Twisted Shrimp after we had started eating on them (sorry). They were sooo good that we could not wait. Missed pics of the Onion Rings (oh la la) and Salmon (scrumptious). Would recommend this place to anyone cause the food is delicious and the service very good, but be aware the prices may eat up your monthly date night budget.
__label__4	If you want to try this restaurant I strongly recommend a reservation. Their dining area is incredibly small and so it fills up fast. All of the food was beautifully plated. The ingredients were fresh and the dishes were very hearty. I enjoyed everything except the desserts which were overly sweet. The small dining room made the service difficult and we were at a table in the middle of the room near the entrance so we constantly felt trampled. This place would be awesome if they expanded the size of the room.
__label__5	Great place to try some local craft beer. Cameron was extremely helpful in finding job st the right IPA, letting me try 5 different beers before I settled on the Black Abbey 5 Points IPA
__label__5	This place is basically perfect. I have been in for lunch; they have sweet and savory pastries that are so yummy. But yesterday was my birthday and my family ordered a hazelnut opera cake to celebrate. I seriously think it was the best cake ive ever had.  The hazelnut mousse was creamy and delicious set off by a chocolate layer and a bottom crunch layer.
__label__5	A classic!! Love rolling up her and getting some soft serve. Best dipped cones in nashville!!!
__label__2	"I'm sure that there are more weirdos in Rittenhouse, but there are far more regular people to balance them out. In Washington Square that simply isn't the case. As bad as this sounds, they are TOO VISIBLE. Every other bench at times. I used to eat some to go meals here once in while, but not lately.

And the leaf blowers are really obnoxious in the morning. REALLY. I'd recommend the park across the street behind Independence Mall instead. There are no weirdos and no dog walkers... just tourists."
__label__5	breakfast was amazing, and the cupcake was to die for!!! Had the red velvet and it was so good!!! the cafe itself was super cute inside and the service was great.
__label__4	Staff is always friendly, especially the older woman who works there. I appreciate you!
__label__4	Great family restaurant to go for breakfast, brunch or lunch. It's family owned and been in Brandon, it seems like, forever. Not a very large restaurant and expect a good wait on Saturday or Sunday. They now offer gluten free options. Thank you.
__label__1	The worst.  I think the food is all frozen.  If not it sure tastes like it.       Too many great places on gulf Blvd to eat here.    It's sort like a night out at the. Mediocre  seafood restaurant in your hometown .... Your hometown that's  nowhere near the ocean.  Seriously.  Try guppys or salt rock grill for much better guaranteed fresh food
__label__5	Awesome experience. My wife loved the hoW the beard trim turned out.  Mr. Courtney is a cool dude!
__label__2	"Not impressed. The reviews were really good and I had my hopes way up. 

Being on vacation in the South from California I'm thinking I'm in for some serious BBQ. 

Well, The brisket was very fatty and the veggies were over cooked. 

Not even close to being great barbecue in my book. I've had better BBQ in the form of a pressed rib meat sandwich from a place known for Golden Arches and a clown named Ronald. 

Maybe they were having a bad night or its just me. If I find myself in Tampa again I will eat elsewhere."
__label__4	"If you are tired of the classic resturant  chains in brentwood area? Then this is your place. The Chicago Italian Beef sub dipped completely in au ju sauce is unbelievable. 

This hole in the wall is the place to hit up! Great price great service."
__label__5	Great local biz. Super friendly & food & drink were delicious. Thanks!
__label__5	"I love the atmosphere of the Tamarack. Sully's is awesome.. 
I just wish the slots were looser.."
__label__4	We continue to be impressed by all the staff at TSD.  They offer alternatives to higher cost procedures and products.  Dr., Matthews, Liz and all the rest of the staff are very empathetic, and willing listen to your concerns and willing to work within your schedule and budget.
__label__2	"The guy at the door said the cover charge was $5. We heard after our group it was going to be $15. We get to the register. The lady stated $10. My friend explained to her that she was quoted 5. She rudely replied ""it is 10 bucks do u want me to charge $15 bc I can?"" REALLY!!!!"
__label__2	Food is okay but not worth the price. The drinks were pretty decent. The staff was ok
__label__3	Just OK for now. Used to be 5+!  PLEASE GET MORE HELP! One bartender serving the bar and service is not enough! Used to be our go to place but the last 3 visits killed the original vibe of this place.  Bartender is so busy that sitting at bar is so not relaxing anymore -  watching him rush around, slam coolers, all because he is taking care of a full bar and service! Get more help.  Bring back the vibe.
__label__5	Jenkintown needed a reasonably priced, solid coffee house for decades now. I can see White Horse being a stable fixture in J-Town for years to come. I ordered a small half sandwich Turkey egg cheese for $1.99 that was perfect for what I need in the morning. The latte was well executed and the service was super friendly. The decor matched the laid back yet clean attitude of the servers. Overall, the coffee house hits all of my checkpoints: neighborhood need, price point, clean decor, good execution of food and drink, and friendly service.
__label__5	Best hotdog place! The buns are so good. The only gripe is that the hotdog + fries will set you back around 10 dollars. Other than that, it's a great place for a quick meal
__label__5	Insanely fabulous Chocolate Gooey Butter Cake. It was my first Gooey Butter Cake, however, I shared with others (though I really didn't want to) who have had more experience and they declared it was the best they ever had.
__label__3	Honestly, the setting is much nicer than Miss Saigon and the bowls look cute. I mean cute is when I pay a price for an XL in Phoenix and get an XS small in Tucson
__label__5	Loretta the manager is absolutely the best. They are the inventor of the Panzarotti! Great steak sandwiches and fries and pizza fare. Nice family place.
__label__5	WOW. I was born in PR and grew up in Miami so I'm pretty picky when it comes to Hispanic food. I ordered the arroz con gandules, pernil, and pasteles for delivery and all I can say is WOW. The food is so authentic and delicious. The restaurant was also very helpful and called me in advance to ask whether I'd prefer them to totally boil the pasteles or leave them half cooked for me to finish at home. I will 100 percent be ordering again.
__label__5	"If you like hot chicken, and I guess I do, Hattie B's has it dialed. 

45 minute wait, not too bad. Friendly service. 
Loved the Damn Hot chicken sandwich.  Probably the hottest thing I've had in a while. Great flavor.  

The fresh squeezed lemonade definitely helped the burn.

I also had some mild white meat chicken which was perfectly cooked. Sides were good, I liked the red potato salad. Mac and cheese was in the acceptable range for a side. 

Peach cobbler was good quality and quantity. Easily shareable for two or more."
__label__5	Best dental practice! I had a very good experience. Both of the dentists, the hygienist and the staff are truly awesome and very professional. Nice to have both the exam and the cleaning in the same visit. Would recommend!!
__label__5	Bites were delicious and awesome beer choices. Great service. Also had several tvs to watch games.
__label__5	All the food is great. The queso is the best around. I have been going for years and it's consistently great every time. Ask for Lisa she has been there over the years and sometimes gets me to try something I wouldn't normally have. It's always works out to be very good. It's a vibrant atmosphere with a little Spanish music in the background!
__label__5	Nothing beats this place!!!!!!! From the atmosphere, to the service, to the food. Never ever ever anything but happy when we come here!
__label__4	Soooooooo good and soooooooo worth it. Make sure you get the crawfish pie. Awesomeness at its best. Would eat here again in a minute!
__label__5	Best Whole Foods around!  All in one, household products, toiletries and foods.  Love to have lunch there, so fresh, lots of organic items plus hot or cold options.  Great coffee and juice bar.   It IS high priced and I'd love to see healthy food choices be affordable for everyone who chooses that life style.  No one should ever have to choose between pesticides, hormones, antibiotics or clean and free!
__label__1	I was sorely disappointed when I walked through the door there was a guy with red hair Texting on his phone and beard at the counter with no mask and no covering On his beard.  I immediately turned around and left I was looking forward to a quesadilla nope this place is not for me I will try someplace else.
__label__4	"Had been wanting to try this place for a while. A very respectable beer selection and excellent sides. Seasonal sides were awesome.

My wife and I ordered the chicken, briscuit, cornbread, and green beans. The sweet BBQ sauce was tasty. The cornbread stole the show though. Green beans were flavored well but not crispy enough for my liking."
__label__4	I love the wings!! Their pizza reminds me of know, but their thicker crust is not the best. They are always fast and friendly when I go to pick up my food. Thankyou for that.
__label__3	I have eaten lunch here twice. The outdoor patio is pleasant and a great place to sit and watch the foot traffic on State Street. The food is just OK and the lunch menu is standard sandwiches, burgers and salads.
__label__4	We've been coming to this location for over 20 years and it never disappoints. The food is the best in town by far. I need to expand my horizons and choose something other than enchiladas and chile reyleno. But then again,  if it's not broken, dont change.
__label__5	Unbelievable experience. I went crazy on the aps. Calamari, edamame, yellow fish jalapeño, tempera sweet potato. Teriyaki selection and sauce was great. Everything was Topshelf quality and as fresh as possible. I also enjoyed salmon tartar and fried cheesecake. A very swell time.
__label__2	Disappointing.  Dry brisket and expensive.  Sat at the bar at 3:20pm, ordered a bbq platter and got about 6 slices of brisket.  Three had, obviously, been under a heat lamp since lunch.  Green beans were great, but brisket was like jerky.  Had a salad and that was great, smaller, and $3 up charge.  $29 for one drink during happy hour and a bbq platter with a salad.  Only ate half the brisket... Shouldn't have to tell management anything when they bring out food like that.
__label__5	Salvadoran food. Nice people . Great food. Don't ask for chips and salsa.
__label__3	Been here twice and had two different experiences.  First one I ordered out since I was staying at the westin. Walked over amd they never filled my order, never offered a drink, nothing. Second time I dined in and the food was ok. Grouper with shrimp sauce was good. Drinks loaded with sugarcane which after awhile gets a weird taste. Would. Go back for a third time but no drinks.
__label__1	Tim , the drunk  owner yells at his employees in front of customers and doesn't keep the bar clean  he's too busy playing poker with his buddies and is never there at night too see what's going on. He has no clue. His hell's angels biker buddies bartend at night and they sale meth in the parking lot. Th food was terrible i wouldn't feed that shit to my dog . I will not come back to this dive shit hole bar ever again .
__label__5	I  [heart] you, SC Deli! The Darren's Tuna sandwich is delish and the staff is always upbeat and welcoming. Keep up the great work!!!
__label__5	"Awesome food, great service, everything was prompt and the server was very attentive. Will definitely be back.

Had the scallops, my husband had the crab cakes. So much flavor."
__label__2	Server wasn't wearing a mask which is absolutely unacceptable. During the pandemic I've never had that happened while dining out. The server was extremely rude when our group asked if the mask could be worn. Drinks and food were extremely sub par for the price. The actual restaurant is beautiful and a great vibe but likely won't come back due to the overall experience!
__label__5	Late night burger was perfect! Bacon, super crispy. Fries hit the spot. Staff was very friendly. Quick service. Food hit the spot!
__label__1	The WHOLE entire experience was horrible! The most uncomfortable unwelcoming experience dining out ever. Thanks to the whole staff that sure did act like they did not want us there . And auto grat-d us with just 5 people never again .
__label__2	"This restaurant is trying to do too much. They seem to be pretty good at vietnamese cuisine but are rather poor at everything else. The pad thai was surprisingly bad! The coconut soup had all of the right ingredients but lacked all flavor. The pepper medley salad was less than the sum of its parts. 

stick to what you know instead of chasing fancy big city words like ""fusion""."
__label__5	I cannot say enough good things about this place. From the superb service to the delicious food, I would eat here every day if I didn't have to fit into my pants!
__label__5	Awesome place to go. The owner is very knowledgeable & it's old school. I know I can buy my vacuum bags/ supplies online but I love supporting this local business.
__label__3	I can't say that my first experience at Epic Pizza went well. I just waited about 50min for 2 slices of pizza and garlic knots..... guess they lost my order.... thanks.... Luckily, I just got home and had the garlic knots.....yummmm. The pizza is pretty legit too (I think my bitterness towards my lenghthy wait is tainting the pizza's taste). I would go back and give them one more try.
__label__4	First time visiting this spot, and I have to say, it did not disappoint. I had the oxtail ramen, which gave an incredible flavor to the already amazing broth. I will definitely be going back in the near future!
__label__5	Great brisket and pulled pork! Grilled asparagus accompanied along with garlic toast. The salad bar was fresh, fresh, fresh! Love this place!
__label__2	Pizza and mozzarella sticks probably would've been good if they hadn't been sitting in a car for over 45 min. Service was horrible.
__label__1	Very disappointing experience today. Arrived at the Canopy (we were here last Saturday too) and there were 2 open spots at the bar with water bottles there. The bar tender said they were taken but we waited for 15 minutes and nobody appeared. So, we then waited at a table for some service but nothing happened either. So we left. This place seems to be run by a bunch of kids, nobody was making sure guests were attended to. This will be our last visit here for awhile. There are many other places in St Pete that will gladly give good service.
__label__1	My hair looks terrible and I've been crying all day! Dawn was nice enough, but it was definitely NOT worth the money and I HATE my hair. :( I should have been more wary when they could fit me in so soon...the better stylist take months to get in with. I won't be going back and I do not recommend it.
__label__4	"First time checking out this garden. Here because friends were getting engaged and it has beautiful sceneries. Perfect for pics. Not too crowded which is nice for photo opp. Plenty of uniqueness between different gardens. We came in nov before thanksgiving and not many flowers or plants were in season so we didn't get to see the beautiful flowers like one would normally in those seasons. 

It's definitely dog  friendly as there are many areas for dogs to drink water. Many people did bring their dogs  

Clean restroom  which is always a plus"
__label__2	Great food but they still have not figured out how to get the food out at this location.  Slow gives them credit.   Compared to northern locations this place needs work!
__label__1	"Don't go here unless you're willing to wait a really long time, despite having a reservation. Like hours.

To make matters worse, the man working the desk asked an associate if she could help work down the line of customers. She shouts out, ""I can't, I am working on my email.""

Hard pass. Go somewhere else."
__label__5	Crystal is a wonderful, genuine person!  She really knows her stuff!  All of her ingredients come from and support local businesses (how awesome is that??). We need more Crystals in this world.  My crepe was delicious and the coffee was great!  I'm not even a coffee drinker!  Will definitely come back :)
__label__2	Im sorry after spending time in NY my take on what pizza is has completely changed. This experience was JUST pizza, nothing more nothing less. The drinks we had was better then the pizza . Now Some pretty heavy hitters have given this place some great reviews and Im going to try again only because of that. Im going to attribute the subpar experience to coming in right before close.
__label__5	Went out with a few friends before my winter formal dance. Was really scared to order some sushi for my friends haven't had any before. The Monster roll was absolutely delicious and everyone loved it! The calamari was really flavorful and spicy! Since, we can't drink we got the ramune soda. My boyfriend who loves soda wants boxes of that stuff. We didn't have like one server, one lady gave us food, another guy refilled our water, our server gave us the soda. The service was great though very friendly and positive.
__label__3	Great seafood. Service was courteous & fast. I had crab Au gratin appetizer for my meal, huge portion,lots of crab. Hubby had. Fried Shrimp & Oyster plate, he said oysters could have cooked longer.  Our only complaint was our son ordered 3lbs boiled crawfish, the portion was no where near 3lbs, they needed seasoning & definitely not fresh,would not order boiled seafood here. Crawfish is reason for only 3 stars.
__label__4	I love El Salvador Restaurant, and of course - their pupusas!  It's a no frills place, and family run.  The service is always good and the the price is low.
__label__5	We had the best service from everyone, drinks were never empty,  food was served a the perfect rate and everything we ordered was amazing.  Would definately return.
__label__5	Best birthday brunch ever!!! Staff are awesome. Food and drinks were Immaculate!!!! Thanks for being so lit for my 32nd birthday!!!!!
__label__5	I was told of Cafe Classico by a friend and when I went I was absolutely amazed. The food was excellent and there pizza is the best i've had since living in Florida. You must try It.
__label__4	Really delicious Korean bento lunch. Another table went with beef fried rice and it was a huge portion.  My experience was less than perfect as I had to wait over 30min for my order, pretty sure they botched my order. Also, the Korean channel playing on the TV is a nice concept for atmosphere, but, without grossing anyone out, let me just say that not all Korean TV is restaurant ready by US standards.  I think it's an old Taco Bell building doo.ri.ban I'll be back
__label__4	The food was good and our waiter Jeffery was super nice. It was a slow start to order but he was literally waiting on every table and making drinks. I would definitely come back, I hope they get Jeffery some help because he was doing it all!
__label__5	lunch 04.25.  the dining experience was outstanding.  5 stars 4 ambiance, staff, food preparation and presentation.  my guest had prix fixe.  i had quail and dessert of goat milk cheese cake.  ignore all the pan reviews. just go!
__label__5	I really enjoyed this place. The staff was super friendly and the sandwiches were delicious. I got the slaw be joe and my wife got the Philly cheesesteak. The meats are roasted fresh in house and not some slimy deli meat. Also the freaking cookies are amazing, especially the peanut butter one. Parking is kinda limited. They have a garage next door and they validate for the first thirty minutes but I'm sure it fills up fast. Either way I'll definitely be back .
__label__5	"Love love this place.  So much history, good music all the time and a great staff.  It's a shame bars like this are being taken over by country music ""name"" bars that are all the same machine.    Don't let these gems disappear!"
__label__1	Tables were filthy and manager seemed upset that he had to wait on us.  Bathroom Filthy.  Had to beg for breadsticks.  I usually love fazoli's but I won't be back to this one.
__label__3	Ate here for breakfast.  Tried the meat omelet and the seafood omelet.  Both were very good and the portions were big. Grits came with it or hash browns.  Grits were good as well.  Service was very slow and the coffee was warm and server never returned for refills.
__label__2	This place opens early and the ladies that work there are sweet. But the donuts are nothing special, DD quality at best.
__label__5	I'm so glad I found Francis Park Dentistry! Dr. Habibi has been wonderful to my kids and I! I'm SUPER glad that I found this office!
__label__4	Good, quick food. Service was very good. Portions are generally quite large. Prices are good, especially considering the portion sizes. The potatoes were super crispy and delicious!
__label__2	This is definitely the definition of small ma and pa restaurant. It's very small and only 2 servers. I wouldn't recommend it for a Saturday or if you are needing food immediately. We went on a Saturday morning and sat right away but waited about 15mins or more till we were greeted and order taken. Then it took about 30-45mins for our food. The food was pretty good for breakfast but nothing that left a lasting impression. I would try them again but not with hungry kids.
__label__1	$9 Rickard's Red!?!  Get the f*** out!!!  Poor, poor, poor value.  And I'm pretty sure the burger I ate came from the Harvey's next door.  Shitty restaurant.  Shitty menu.  Server was nice enough.
__label__4	I had a red snapper grilled sandwich it was really good and recommend but ask for extra aioli
__label__4	"First timer. Went to lunch on a Monday. Place not much to look at, but has lots of TVs.
Had their fried chicken dinner with green beans and potato salad. Got to say it ranks as one of the BEST fried chicken dinners I've had in this town.
Beer was cold, prices fair, and service excellent."
__label__5	"Got the eggplant parm sandwich and it came with soup, coleslaw and a pickle for less than $10

Cant beat it! That's a good looking sandwich and it tasted just as good too"
__label__1	"Walked in the place to check it out 
There was one staff member and one customer. That's it.
The staff member NEVER turned his back to acknowledge the presence of potential customers, NEVER greeted us, NEVER said anything
To a manager or owner I encourage you to check any store video
HORRIBLE customer service
After waiting a few moments I said see ya later once and no response
I said it a second time and the employee still did not respond
To a manger or owner can you please address this?
I will tell everyone to avoid this place 
There is no respect for customers. FYI those are the ones that keep you in business"
__label__4	A relative unknown to even most of the locals, but the word needs to be spread! My colleague and I ate lunch here and the food and value are great! Service was spot-on, too! Ambience leaves something to be desired, but I believe that will change as they grow in patronage. We had the chix sandwich and shrimp po boy, and both were very good. If you're looking for great food at a reasonable price, you can't go wrong here!
__label__3	"""Middle of the road"" pretty much sums it up.

Decent, but not great chicken.   Surprisingly abundant menu with many sides, combos, meal deals, and non-chicken items to choose from as well.

The place was pretty clean and well kept.  Staff seemed friendly but Ive only eaten here one time.

Nothing to complain about leaving here, but chicken wasn't good enough to make me go out of my way to come back.  If you're nearby, and price and convenience are the main factors, this place will suit your needs."
__label__5	El Pastor tacos are the best I've ever had!!! Fish tacos are amazing, guacamole was amazing. The taco wheels are homemade and cooked fresh to order. The owners (didn't speak great English) were as nice of people you'll ever meet. I truly recommend you try this small hole in the wall, it will not disappoint
__label__5	"This was a great find for us! We stayed in the combo room and although it was very small, it was cozy and comfortable. 
The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful.  
There was snow while we stayed and it was nice to walk into the hotel to a little fireplace each evening.  
Walking distance to lots of restaurants, sights, etc in the center city. 
Would stay here again for sure."
__label__4	I had a tasty scoop of Brazilian Chip here tonight.  Nice, smooth flavor.  Also, the scoop is rather large - definitely only need one!  I will be back...
__label__2	Food was very good, the seafood boat will feed 4 people. Raw oysters were horrible, $15 dozen which is very high. Worst part was the service. Very slow and did not check on us. Tables stayed dirty for a long time. Place was not very clean.
__label__4	The staff was welcoming and friendly on a recent visit. Our rooms were clean and spacious. The free breakfast was a bit picked over, so I'd recommend getting up a bit early if you want to take full advantage (we ran down in the last few minutes haha). The rooms had mini fridges and microwaves which was a nice touch. Close to KOP mall, Philly, Villanova.
__label__5	We stopped in to buy a wig and Sarah helped us! The selection was good and Sarah helped us find 2 really nice wigs!!! Thank you!!!
__label__5	I can't say enough about their professionalism and prompt response. We are snowbirds who had a Nest thermostat problem after our condo turned off power to the AC. The condo workers couldn't figure out what they had done so Midway came in immediately and kept us on the phone while they troubleshoot the issue. Turned out to be a simple fix. They handled it quickly and we couldn't be more grateful or impressed. They are now our go-to company. Thanks all.
__label__5	Staff was really nice towards my son and I and got us in and out as quick as possible for an MRI.  Overall really good experience at this location.
__label__5	As a business owner I put some hard miles on my SUV and trust this tires plus location with my vehicle. The customer service is consistently excellent and I trust their work and recomendations for maintenance. It is great to find a mechanic shop that is trustworthy. They also have generous coupons if you go to their website.
__label__5	These guys are so schooled in knowledge of cycling. The owner is fun and professional. He makes sure you find the perfect individual bike fit .
__label__5	Excellent service and all tests and results clearly explained plus a friendly professional staff.
__label__5	Omni Catering was highly recommended by our venue and their food was awesome for our wedding. Everything went smoothly and I think they were definately a part of that. And everything looked awesome. I will admit that there were some communication issues at times, but the food being great (our guests raved about it) and the level of service on the day was top notch and made up for it. My husband and I always felt very taken care of whether it was during dinner or every time we went to the bar. Little details like that mean a lot and can make the day feel that much more special.
__label__5	Pier 60 is a hot spot for tourists. However living only 5 min away it's a go to place for us. Always a fun night after dinner or just to walk around! Of course you always have to get the if cream!
__label__4	First time at The Eastern Peak. We've passed this many times and after a fun night out decided to stop. The food was good and came out quickly (although it was a Monday night so not a busy night), and Iris, our server, was very pleasant.
__label__1	This place is awful. After ordering a cheese basket, we recieved cheese with a a bite out of it. Such a low value of entertainment compared to the rest of the places in nashville.  Service is OK.  Food selection is lacking.  Do not be tricked by the coupons being handed out for 10% off down the street.  Its not worth it!!!
__label__5	I took my mother here yesterday and after trying several places that were obviously all packed being mothers day, they too were packed but got us in very quickly! Despite being absolutely busy, they gave us friendly fast service and our server was outstanding as well!
__label__4	Awesome little lunch buffet!  I miss being within walking distance of this place, I haven't been in a while, long overdue for some curry and rice.
__label__5	I've ordered take out twice now and they do not disappoint! Best NY Pizza in The area. Always fresh with an appropriate amount of roni grease. They have amazing lunch options as well! I'll always choose NY Pizza over chains.
__label__5	A very homey place. It's an affordable place and the portions are pretty big!
__label__2	Went for breakfast on a Monday morning at 11am. Wasn't very busy and we were told their would be a 25 minute wait for our food. We decided to order chips and salsa while we waited.  I had to ask for them 20 minutes later.  Food came up soon after that.  Cold, salty and sparse.  Would not suggest to choose this as one of your breakfast places while in Nashville.
__label__5	"Very very good ,clean and staff was excellent !
Sign a little small to see from across. The street but I could smell  some good cooking !! American omelet was Eggcellent !"
__label__4	I've been here a few times now and each visit has been great.  Great margaritas, good food, awesome wait staff...cute and charming, every time.  Havent had a bad dish yet.
__label__1	Two minutes in this place and you're going to smell like cigarettes for the rest of the day. Even with coronavirus they are still letting idiots smoke inside. I don't think I'll ever come back here because I can't stand cigarette smoke and all I did this time was placed an order to go
__label__4	"I absolutely love my nails. First time going to nathans, they did hurt me a little but I love how they did my acrylic set thin and they put the right amount of coats. I had gone to this one place in LA right before and they made my nails thick and you could tell it needed another coat but the lady didn't want to use another coat saying 'i was fine'. 

Thankfully I was in and out of there in an hour. Definitely recommend them !"
__label__5	Wonderful first float experience. Owner talked me through the logistics and some general idea of what to expect. Very welcoming space; clean modern rooms (with excellent shower, too). Float itself was very relaxing. I'll be coming back.
__label__1	I will not be returning. The food was not fresh, over priced and not what we expected at all The fries appeared to be fried in old grease. The catfish, shrimp and alligator had no flavor. The cocktail sauce and tarter sauce had been sitting out for a period of time. If you're traveling, do not try this place.
__label__4	"I saw reviews go up and last time the food wasn't so hot most times. Well this time the Alfredo fries were creamy, and I haven't yet tried the cheesesteak, I'm glad to see a change in the place.

The delivery driver was pretty cool too. I would eat here again now."
__label__5	A much needed attraction for Santa Barbara.  the venue has intrinsic entertainment. The bartender Olivia  is cute as a button and does her job above and beyond. Go listen or sing along and have a libation filled time!
__label__4	Small place, we lucked out and got there right as someone was getting up. Seafood and spinach omelet was great as were the pancakes. Over cooked the over easy eggs, but that was the only down fall. Good Bloody Mary, will go back.
__label__5	Fantastic! We had Sunday breakfast. The waitress welcomed us to PA. Spanish omelette (YUM), breakfast bagel sandwich was a perfect size for a lite appetite. My fiber hungry father in law enjoyed his oatmeal with raisins.
__label__3	"Never heard of this store, but I spotted it tucked away in a shopping center with a Kohl's and a Target. A home decor shop perfect for that shabby chic, rustic urban farmhouse feel that watching too much of Joanna and Chip Gaines on HGTV will inflict on you. Never mind that you live in suburban NJ and not in a farmhouse.

It reminds of Pier 1

And Home Goods.

And a little of TJ Maxx and Marshalls.

Worth perusing the discounted section but if you see something, buy it because it probably won't be there in a few days."
__label__5	I love this place! The salsa they make is amazing and they have a TON of vegetarian and vegan options!
__label__4	Super convenient and open late. Food was average, something similar to Waffle House. We are there 3/5 days that we were in NOLA. The food was consistent and the customer service was beyond great. I do recommend!
__label__5	Have an old car and new to town. Received honest answers and they only fixed what I asked. Will definitely return.
__label__4	"Really enjoyed my lunch bento box. They were generous with the portions. I had the steak bento. 5 California rolls, 2 fried dumplings, rice, salad, soup and of course the steak. 
Sushi my bf had was good. Also had a tuna and avocado appetizer... avocado was a bit mushy in his opinion. 
Friendly staff, nice ambiance for lunch"
__label__4	Good omelettes and their staff is super friendly and always cheery and starting out any morning with good food and great hospitality is certainly the right way to begin your day. Great job guys.!!!
__label__5	Got a french gel mani/pedi done today with my mom. Tina and Trang were great! She did the lines just how i like them, not too thin. A little rough on the cuticles but the finish looked amazing. They offer complimentary drinks and I was very relaxed. The hot towel was my favorite part. Much needed after my half marathon yesterday! I will definitely be back :)
__label__2	"I don't know. Maybe we'll need to give this one another try? 

Waited 30 minutes for a table when there were visibly several available, hostess with just a little too much attitude, and the entire restaurant smelled like fish... Not in a good way. 

The manager made somewhat of an effort to smooth things over. But not enough. That's okay. We just took our $624 and spent it down the street at St. Elmo's instead..."
__label__4	Great beer selection - great food - great atmosphere! Can't go wrong with the Pour House!
__label__2	Not impressed... my son ordered the French toast, kids meal, comes with 1 piece of French toast, no meat. He didn't like it, they took it back ok, then he got pancakes. I got the sausage gravy biscuit with 2 eggs, over medium, they where over easy... To Undercooked for me, sausage gravy was not that great. I also got a side of the potatoes, they were ok, cubed red bliss potatoes... Will not come back
__label__4	Quality breakfast spot.  Layout and atmosphere of restaurant is great. Server was friendly and prompt and kept my drink full - that's a must!  I ordered a combo with eggs, bacon, with a side of biscuits and gravy.  The food arrive quick and was great - I'll definitely be back!
__label__5	"Best shoe store in Philadelphia, hands down. I LOVE this store, and the owner Elena is the sweetest most helpful lady you can find. The shoes are incredible, I have purchased many shoes here. I get compliments all the time and I have never been unsatisfied with a purchase. I am not a big spender and I usually don't have a lot of cash to blow, but it's worth every penny. 

Seriously, go here, you won't be disappointed and you will be supporting a local gem. 
Cheers!"
__label__5	Was very pleasantly surprised. Was such a lovely brunch with a great view. I had the Tampa  bowl which had eggs, chorizo, jalapeño, cheese etc over hash browns. It was delicious. The Prosecco was also on point. Service was great.
__label__5	I'm a Jace Face! The store manager and the tailors do a great job every time I shop there. He knows his stuff not to pushy and even sent me a hand written thank you card. Not many places will go that extra mile. I highly recommend you go there and ask to become a Jace Face! He will take great care of you.
__label__1	"This station is far more disgusting than the one at Race/Vine.
It reeks - especially in the summer (I don't wanna know).

Definitely scary!"
__label__1	"Mandy called to do a courtesy call to ensure my order was delivered correct. After informing her that the garlic sauce that I prepaid for didn't arrive, she showed NO concern then hung up the phone on me.
Word of advice: be courteous when you call MY phone! Thanks to your rude ass employee, Dominos just lost a customer! Hello Papa Johns."
__label__3	"Pros- Chicken quesadilla was very yummy. The restaurant has a neat environment, but it is somewhat small. Quick and easy access if you are visiting the Country Music Hall of Fame or work nearby. My boyfriend got the steak nachos which were DELICIOUS, but could have used a good bit more meat on them. 

Cons- Pricey! There are not any waitresses or servers that come around. They strictly stay behind the counter unless they are bringing you your food. You do have to order at counter before you sit."
__label__1	The help here is much like the food they serve.....................NOT GOOD !!!!!!!!!
__label__5	For my first time being back in a New Orleans I had a really great experience here. I usually get gel polish but the nail tech recommended dip polish and I kid you not it is the best thing since sliced bread and it's fast. I came here on Sunday so the traffic wasn't bad the parking was easy and there was no wait. The price is very fair as well. If anyone had a bad experience it had to be a lie because the customer service and their skill level is absolutely amazing. Those are my real nails btw
__label__4	I enjoyed my time eating here! The atmosphere is nice and relaxing and it makes you feel like your in another world! The service was good for the most part, just wished they'd come around and fill the water more often. I loves the turkish coffee! I got a kind of sausage which came with this pickled onion salad that combined really well! Cant wait to try out the rest of the menu!
__label__5	Do yourself a favor and try this place. My favorite ribs and mac and cheese! Not to mention every other thing I have tried. Next is the Mac Daddy. Yikes!
__label__1	"Was an hour past delivery time and the food was horrible. Ordered 3 different things and they are all being thrown away, it is that bad. Will normally eat whatever. Hotel I am staying at had a brochure for this place and looked good. Don't mind waiting for god food but this place is garbage. 

Stay away from this place!!"
__label__3	"Drinks are pricey. 
Music is extra loud but played good songs.
No cover.
Cute bartenders.
Fast service. 
Strong drinks."
__label__4	Food was good.  Service was great.  Had the panang curry and the pad thai noodles and both were pretty awesome.  Will definitely be back
__label__4	I was looking for a place where I can buy decent gluten-free bakings in the city, and my mother-in-law recommended this place. I have tried their gluten-free cakes, which you can pick and chose what you want in your cake, and they were great. You cannot really tell the cake is gluten-free; the cake does not taste like cardboard and its texture is soft and moist. I would go back to the bakery when I would like gluten-free bakings in the future.
__label__5	Brooke did a great job on my tattoo. I definitely plan on going back to her for the rest of my tattoos.
__label__5	"Smoked brisket plate, smoked corn beef Ruben, 5 draft beers, fries and salad = $61.
The food was the best we hav had in a loooong time. They smoke their own beef there. WOW gooooood.
Sunshine, beach chairs, parking is still $5 all adds up to a wonderful time.

Thank u Israel and ur staff for a spectacular visit. Michael is still an outstanding employee. We can not wait to do it again. I want to try the philli chees steak."
__label__4	The cannoli are good. The best thing I had was this chocolate-covered banana with raspberry filling and cream stuffed in it, it was absolutely delicious. I also had this chocolate nut tarte, which was also delicious. I'd come back just to get those things. Great service, too, the people are clearly passionate and knowledgeable about what they do.
__label__5	This salon is amazing! I come here everytime for my Brazilian, I highly recommend Angelika. She is very professional and through. You can ensure she will get the job done quickly and efficiently. Thank you Angelika for the amazing experience. I will for sure be returning.
__label__4	"Overall this place is great.  

They has some kind of special sauce for ice cream that someone recommended yet for me it was just soso.  

The people who work here are super friendly.  I like the plain ice cream.  Very very delicious.  I combined the banana and peanut butter ice creams which made it extra great. Yum!

I recommend adding short tables as not everyone can sit in a high chair.  

Very cute place."
__label__4	Love the 50% off coupon plus additional 50% off, but it does seem as though the items have been originally priced to compensate for when they're 50% discounted.  Still, way cheap than buying new.  Focuses on a nice selection of clothes, not much as far as furniture, appliances, and other things.
__label__4	Great Mexican food that is amazing fresh!  Get the spare rib plate with enchiladas.. The greens also have a little heat to them :)
__label__5	We came here for fresh, raw oysters.  First rate oysters, first rate service.  Sit at the bar if you can, it's highly entertaining.
__label__5	Great place!! Eli was very polite and took his time. He knows what he is doing and my husband looked great! Thank you
__label__5	I would take meritts over IHOP or Sherri's on any late night. I wouldn't say they have the healthiest food, especially there scones. But it is a pretty good place to eat especially after everything closes down. Different environment but I like it.
__label__3	They service my car as I ask without upselling, but they need to stop doing stupid stuff.
__label__5	Loved this place! Atmosphere was friendly. There were lots of locals but bar tenders were still attentive and friendly to us out of towners.  Food was awesome and selection of beers was interesting and ever changing.
__label__4	Great sour and cider selections! Happy hour was until 7 PM. The wings were sooooo good.
__label__2	Third visit. Against my better judgement. You want good pub food great. If you want at least a few healthy options forget it.
__label__1	"Worst CB I have ever been to. Over easy eggs with hard cooked yolks, bone dry pork chops that he couldn't even swallow, dry dry dry hash brown casserole and the worst part? Not only was it bad food, it was ICE COLD bad food.

Never again :("
__label__2	Sales associates are too pushy.  You are hounded from the minute you walk in the door.  I have walked out numerous times.  I like to shop and not feel pressured.  It is a shame because my kids like their clothes.
__label__3	the boba was good but the tea was very watery. the cups were very cute though, and so was the store's environment
__label__1	Unreal place. Had to wait 10 minutes for the hostess to seat us and a few other couples. They had 10 booths open. Waited 45 minutes and was told that our order would be out in a few minutes and a few minutes later the same waitress came over with the original order slip and asked what we had ordered. So she lied so I left. Really felt like we were a nuisance being there. One star is one star to many and if I was the owner of this place I would fire everyone and start over. Absolutely the worst dining-non dining experience of my life.
__label__5	Tropichop bowls are the best! Service is prompt and wonderful and the sauce bar is to die for!
__label__5	Good local sushi place. Orders to go are great, patio is dog friendly and inside is cozy.  Ahi poke salad is good for lunch and sashimi dinner comes w everything else that's good... For what you pay for you can't beat it.
__label__1	Horrible...waited about one hour for the food delivery.  Pizza was cold and made incorrectly. The antipasto was a pile of unrecognizable meat. Inedible.
__label__1	"Tried this place again as it is close to my home. My kids wanted a taco. JUST awful. When you walk in the floor is dirty, the soda machine was scungy, and the beef smelled off. 

The customer service is non existent.

Tried it twice, will not go again. I think it will be closed soon. So awful."
__label__5	"If you are looking for vintage, out of print or off beat books this is a great used book store. Stacked but in great order and easy to find.
I never leave without a bag full of new favorites!!"
__label__4	"A really great outdoor market. Good resource for the unexpected. Have a great time sorting through old silverware, rifling through piles of vintage clothing or rooting through random cardboard boxes. If you're in the area and want an excuse for time in the open air, Golden Nugget is a must.
Prices are more than fair and I've found some of my favorite treasures here.
The only drawback, the lot that the market is in is dusty dirt. Wear old shoes and don't go on a dry summer day."
__label__4	I like that they use fresh and local produce. Good sandwich place with some soups and salads.
__label__3	"Nice remodel job. Server new to trade. Food fair. Carnitas tacos wet and sweet. (My personal preference is drier and savory.) Chicken for tacos in little cubes. No hot sauces available~ tasty roasted salsa and green blended salsa upon request ~mild to medium only.  Beans and rice fair~American Mexican style. 
This eatery is likely nice for large families~big box/chain fans should help this nice little Eagle location make a go of it."
__label__5	I'm a local technician and am thankful I have Flirty Lash to save me in a supply pinch. The front desk girl, I think her name is Michelle, is always friendly and courteous.
__label__5	This place is delicious. Service was fast and friendly. Definitely coming back. This place has food for everyone. The Dan Dan noodles are a must. Get them.
__label__5	I've driven by many times and today we finally stopped for brunch. Everything was hot and fresh and the brunch sliders were amazing!  The mimosa was perfect.
__label__4	Good food. Good service. Comfortable seating. Friendly atmosphere. Reasonable prices. My popcorn shrimp was good. My wife had chicken and shrimp that she loved. My daughter had a clam basket that she enjoyed. My son had shrimp alfredo that he liked. The only thing I didn't like was they don't give biscuits or bread to the table before the meal. Other than that everything was great.
__label__5	Really good sushi on Royal!  My 5 year old son loved the ramen noodles. Great ambiance!
__label__1	"The lady who works their made me pay twice for my cigs apparently the first time I gave her it 20 it disappeared she said I didn't give it to her. Funny how the person behind me in line said ""I seen you put the 20 down the 1st time"""
__label__2	Food was good. Service was AWFUL and very rude. Waitress didn't bring us silverware, then they practically threw us out as soon as we finished.
__label__5	Food was good. On top customer service was Good. That's why I give 5 and sweet tea is amazing.
__label__5	Very good service! The threading was painless, it was super quick (I'm talking a minute and a half tops), and it was only $10! Just walk in, sign your name and wait your turn!
__label__4	"Breakfast was descent. Coffee nice and strong.

Good service.

For dinner a perfect balance between formality and casual.

For breakfast the background music was way too loud."
__label__5	I always come to Süp when visiting Reno! Everything is so delicious, my favorite sandwich being the BBQ chicken! They have a great selection of beer and wine! Atmosphere is awesome, great place to catch up with friends and family. The staff is beyond amazing and super friendly.
__label__5	I have been a quarterly customer for over a year. I have found Newtown Termite & Pest Control to be very reliable and professional. They always take the time to ask if we have any problems. I like the fact that they cover their shoes while in the home. They do a great job and I would highly recommend them.
__label__1	Service is too slow! They should have chickenjoy ready when people order. How can a fast food restaurant that specializes in fried chicken ran out of chicken and make you wait for 30 mins in the parking lot after waiting for 3 hours in line, not to mention they are just doing drive thru due to COVID-19. Advised of the frustration I had, lady that brought food just left and didn't say a word.
__label__5	Love this place.. to me this is how food is made  the people that own this place also have other places that are great city fish on Tampa rd and ballyhoos in tarpon springs all are my best spots to eat and bring loved ones
__label__1	The lady was extremely rude! Would not let us buy one cat at a time and demanded that we buy two or buy none at all. I don't recommend this place to anyone unless you want to be judged!!
__label__4	"Gotta love this place for its fried chicken, deceptive hole in the wall appearance, and friendly service.  

The chicken is made to order, so either call ahead, or expect to wait 10-15 minutes. But worth the wait, savory, light, crispy crust with juicy meat on the inside. The cole slaw provides just the right counter note.

The place owned by an ex Marine who used to work at Commander's Palace in New Orleans! How can you beat that.

Give it a try, you won't regret it."
__label__1	got the tom yum soup. mushrooms were dirty and there were like 2 pieces of chicken all together. not very welcoming and was not checked on once. won't be returning
__label__5	Fantastic entrees, cocktails, and apps.  Just be ready to get comfortable with fellow diners because space is tight.
__label__5	Every time I get Applebee's it's great I don't understand some of these people negative comments to Conner pathetic and sad and really petty get the pasta it is so good.
__label__1	Nothing but a scamming company!!! They will take your deposit ! Do not rent from them ! I hope they go out of business ! Do not rent from them go to first key homes and rent from them
__label__3	The short ribs were terrible!  Do not get them.   I'm only giving a 3 star because the waitress was very nice and the ribs had a dry rub which is the only kind of BBQ I like.  I took the family there and it was underwhelming.  Sorry to see as we spend a lot of time here.
__label__5	"5 stars for the simple fact that I sampled 5 beers and all 5 were great. I'm usually hoping to find 2 to 3 beers  per brewery that are at least drinkable. These were all fantastic. Great service and friendly people.

Two thumbs up for this place!"
__label__5	Juliana is a flipping goddess!! My hair was a snarl of bleach and bad dye and she saved me in time for my friends wedding. She took out some bad knots I was afraid I'd have to cut, gave me a style, fantastic dye and a blow out that survived Florida summer. Love the barber shop vibe, I don't do salons. Will be back!
__label__5	Had my hair coloured by Wayne . He truly is a miracle worker! This was the first time I had used this salon and was a little apprehensive. My hair was a disaster , my roots were shades darker than the rest ( done by a previous hairdresser) Wayne was able to sort this , it took two dyes but he did it! I am truly happy with it and he doesn't overcharge !He Also only takes 1 client at a time. His shampoo he uses on your hair smells amazing! , very reasonable prices ! I will be coming back again!
__label__4	"I love the french onion soup.

Bar downstair is also nice.  I have eaten here multiple times and never been disappointed.

I would classify it as a solid standby with a good staff."
__label__3	Long lines even at late night. And long wait after ordering. Everybody looking at their phone.  But honestly,  even the medium is too hot for me to enjoy.  My son loved it and demolished the hot level,  albeit with frequent breaks to show his  taste buds mercy. This is not for light weights, or for those with ulcers and/or bad gastritis. It will burn.
__label__4	This has now become one of my go to pizza places.  The staff is friendly (I especially like chatting with Jordan) and the service has significantly improved from opening.  The bean salad is a fun extra and the pizzas are excellent.  I like the Linda with lemon, arugula, and honey. The daily specials are great too.  Can't go wrong with many yummy options and dining on the patio is also nice in the summer time.
__label__5	Absolutely delicious delicious.Fresh and great food.i don't think you can go wrong ording anything here.service was great and I enjoyed my meal.Cant wait to go back and try something else
__label__1	"Completely useless customer service. Ordered a simple ""swami beach"" smoothie for my 3 year old, kept us waiting for 20 mins, when I walked up and asked them for it, they were completely lost and were asking me why my buzzer did not go off. How would I know? Rude and terrible at customer service. They were not interested in rectifying the situation. I guess they have become too big for caring about customers.

Would not recommend to waste your money there."
__label__4	I like the food and atmosphere here.  It's more upscale than Applebees or TGI Fridays.  Prices can rise above $20 for an entree but there are plenty of options under that amount. For a Friday night after 7pm our wait was only 2 minutes.  We had a free chicken tender appetizer coupon so that was a plus.
__label__5	I've been going to Monro for the $20 oil changes for awhile. The manager, Tom, is always helpful and friendly. Even without an appointment, oil changes usually take 20-30 minutes.
__label__5	An explosion of flavors cooked into the chicken fried rice, with the perfect amount of spicy kick. You can tell everything is fresh and made to order and that the crew knows how to cook Thai food the right way. Definitely worth a stop to try!
__label__5	"From my ER experience to my surgery and hospital stay, the level of care was exceptional.
Room spotless, everyone kind and attentive
I have no negatives in my entire 4 day stay"
__label__5	I had a great experience with Dazzling Diamonds - Jared came in person and cleaned my house.  The end price he charged was under what he quoted at the start, because it took him less time than he'd originally expected.  However, that doesn't mean he didn't do an excellent job - he did: my house hasn't looked this good since before I moved in.  I'll be having Dazzling Diamond clean my house monthly going forward, and highly recommend them to anyone looking for a regular cleaning service in Sacramento
__label__5	Excellent bands, wonderful 'historic' place for live music! They had a fun stage at Voodoo this year and the local bands were amazing!
__label__1	Customer service sucks. After 55 minutes finally got a sales person. He showed us a few units then said he had another customer and left us stranded a mile from our truck. Not one person in a cart offered to give us a ride back. One said he would be back in 5 minutes. 20 minutes later we had to walk the mile. All this with my wife on a cane from surgery. Will not return there again.
__label__5	Steve repaired our treasured Panasonic plasma TV at reasonable cost and with absolute precision and was a pleasure to talk with while he was doing it.  I'm retired from a forty plus year technical career.  You can trust this recommendation.  Steve is the man you want and need to fix your TV reasonably and respectfully.  He has his craft nailed.
__label__5	Best bagels in Media!! Yummm. Actually close to a NY bagel especially when you can catch them fresh out of the oven. And they have whole wheat everything and sun dried tom! My only very minor criticism is I wish they had more lox in the lox spread. But it's sooooo tasty!!
__label__2	Decent food, tater tots appetizer tasted like they were frozen and microwaved, server was trying to remember our order, but totally screwed it up later, asked for no tomato and cheese on my California cluck and guess, I still got it!  2 stars for the boneless hot wings, but go to Buffalo Wild Wings, this place is a cheap knock off of it!
__label__5	"great food!
learned about ""cheese crisps"" here.
my mexican restaurant don't have these.
northern cal. but i can teach them"
__label__4	Best Indian food in Tampa. Loved the gas station location. Very unique.
__label__5	Brought friends today for their first experience...They are hooked. This place is amazing and the products are Spot ON! Just wish they were a little more generous with the servings. Great flavor & taste! Looking forward to the new location in SOHA!
__label__5	I will recommend this restaurant on food, service and cleanliness. I will visit it again and again. Thank you  Gila for your kindness and professionalism.
__label__5	Enjoyed everything about this place. Staff was helpful and inviting. I am not well versed when it comes to Vietnamese food but they walked me through the menu. I look forward to my next visit. I'm sure it will be as delicious as the last.
__label__4	"Very impressed visiting family member staying in king room suite. Large room , clean comfortable with fridge big dining table sofa & patio . Rustic wood sante fe style courtyards , small pool but quaint w mural jacuzzi spa would be nice at night too! ( closes at 9 a little early free towels ) 
The rooms courtyards pool are most impressive inside not from road. Good location with several restaurants stores everything u need including us all park & rec center ."
__label__3	Great food but terrible set up. The only method for carry out is curbside pick up but they can't seem to keep track of cars as they come in. I often have to go let them know I'm waiting. The food has been late the past 3 times I've carried out and the staff has an attitude problem. I'm just trying to get me pizza, not ruin your day.
__label__5	Great food. The sweet thai basil is amazing. Service is excellent!
__label__4	"I've been coming here recently to work ""at home"" and am enjoying it for the most part. Every time I arrive though, I'm *hoping* there's a seat near the front of the building. If you don't find one there, you're stuck in the back area that is quite dark. It's not bad to be in the back, it's just not as ""cozy"" to sit for extended periods of time.

Service is normal, and basically it's a convenient Starbucks for all the normal reasons (wifi, location, etc.)"
__label__1	Stay away! We had a 6pm reservation on Mother's Day, by 7:30 we only had soup. To say the service was bad is an understatement. We asked for more rolls and never got them...when we said we were leaving they brought us a bill for drinks and calamari. Again no apologies they watched us walk out the door.
__label__5	Enjoying a lovely chocolate tart with honey and berry sauce. Earthy, mildly sweet and different than anything I have tried in Reno. Looking forward to going back to try some elixirs or kava some time soon.
__label__5	This is a must see for Philly. Every part of the garden is actual magic. The surrounding neighborhood is just as stunning. The Instagram models were annoying as all get out but still worth it.
__label__1	"Too many bad experiences with service here. The food is mostly meh and when they screw up they really do not seem to care. Sometimes they should cater to the customer when they make a mistake. Not going back
This place  is the fucking worst
The place is pure trash
Gross"
__label__1	This place isnt that great.  Service was VERY slow. Food was not that great....my salad had wilted lettuce, the beans weren't baked, but pinto, and I had to send my cowgirl steak back because it wasnt cooked right. You are paying for the ambiance....not the service or the food. I would not recommend eating here and won't go again.
__label__1	Called ahead and waited 20 minutes before going there. Waited an additional 40 minutes after being asked my name twice. There was 0 care or apology to for the wait. This is what happens when you have too many Franchisees where poor management leads to poor quality. The food was poorly prepared as well.
__label__5	This was very unexpected.  I enjoyed everything that was brought to the table.  It was my friends birthday dinner and the service was kinda slow but not bad. Definitely will come back and try some other items.
__label__4	"Eggcellent all around. Even opened early for me yesterday! This place is a hidden gem.

We had breakfast here for five days. Each visit was a fine dining experience, and the price wasn't too bad either. This isn't a basic ham and egg joint. Think Fritatas, Crepes and great coffee. Service was always top notch, too."
__label__1	Extremely expensive for a retail chain. The average item is twice the price of Walmart or Winco even basic items like bread and milk.
__label__5	World class beer selection! May be a little unorganized but that makes the hunt for a special beer all the more fun. Looks like a great selection of liquor and wine as well.
__label__2	Shocked by the reviews because the food had zero taste. Seriously, very bland tacos and we got a few different kinds. Disappointing. Rice and beans weren't terrible. We ate here because almost everything is gluten free, but we would not go back. Also they are cash only, so be prepared.
__label__5	"My wife's birthday. Her comment:  ""This is really a wonderful restaurant "". My son ""holy shit, these are good""."
__label__2	My son LOVES BAB so we came to this location since we were in area. The staff weren't as bubbly & energetic as the other locations, but that was ok. We picked out our bear, only to have to come back so they could fix the stitching! (1st time this has happened). That was an inconvenience. Just wish it could have been sewn properly the first time.
__label__5	Absolutely excellent. Great service, wine & food. I requested a dry red and was brought exactly what I prefer. The tortilla chips were made to order and were great. I  recommend the queso and salsa. After our appetizer we enjoyed a chili oil mushroom and goat cheese pizza. It was outstanding. Excited to try the new spot out.
__label__5	Thai Boat Restaurant is some of the best Thai food I have had in a long time. The green curry is a subtle and amazing blend of flavors.  The pad see ew is a must try. I would definitely recommend adding a little of the red chili sauce. The restaurant is exceptionally clean and lovely. Service is prompt and friendly.  If I am ever in Brandon again, I will definitely return!
__label__5	Really great pico de gallo and chips. Had carne asada tacos and they were AMAZING. Tasty complimentary margarita too. Just a good place. Going back for sure!
__label__5	Excellent for food, friendly staff, decoration may not be the best but when it comes to service and what's on the plate it's great.
__label__5	"I ordered a 6' farmhouse table in March, 2014. It has been almost 3 years and the table has held amazingly well, even with two young kids in the house who are rough on it at times.

Philip Roberts was an absolute pleasure to deal with and they delivered the table as planned, nicely wrapped and protected, to my apartment in Brooklyn, NY. 

Highly recommended."
__label__1	I would never eat here again. The food was overpriced and the service was awful. If you want to ask people to see their receipt before giving them their food then you need to do it to everyone because otherwise it seems like stereotyping.  The food was ok but like I said I will never return. You can get better steaks and a better experience other places in philly.
__label__5	The food was amazing.. poultrygeist is deliciously hot.  Our waiter was Dylan and he was awesome.. great service,  very friendly and great with people of all ages. .  We love Dylan! Thanks for making our Nashville trip even better
__label__4	Besides the clueless hostess who would not help us find our friends in the packed restaurant.. The food and service was great. A little pricey but definitely could eat the food leftovers for days.
__label__1	"BUGS!
We will never order from here again. 
Ordered late just to find bugs in our order. The kicker is we had already started eating when we found them. 

I just wish we had a good local Chinese place."
__label__5	Coffee is not great, but very well priced.  The baristas are friendly and get you your coffee fast.  Also, provide free water.  food looks great even though I have never eaten there.  Over all it's better atmosphere than Starbucks across the street, and they are WAY more cheap.  There internet is fast....that's important.
__label__1	"I literally just pulled a box staple out of my 1 of my 3 rolled tacos. WOW!! It's 1am and not going to call, also so hungry going to chew lightly on the other 2 rolled tacos. Some how I doubt I'll get a manager response back on this.. It's my last Los Betos experience ever. Sad to me as its next to my house. I promise my friends/coworkers/barmates/ check out stand people/and any person I have a food conversation with won't be going there ever again..

:("
__label__2	It's a cute store and relatively good sized. Most of what they have is extremely overpriced though. Some basic 90s T-shirts were $40+! It also drives me crazy when vintage or thrift stores don't sort anything by size. The person behind the counter was friendly at least.
__label__5	Absolutely Love this place with its homey atmosphere,, lunch specials, and super friendly staff! Some of my favorites are the Pork in a Clay Pot, Steamed Buns, and nearly all of the vegetarian/vegan selections. Go!
__label__4	"Tucked in the far side of the Bywater, this place has delicious fried seafood and a quirky, old-timey atmosphere. I'm a huge fan of the catfish, the (towers) of onion rings, and the baked mac and cheese.

Definitely worth a trip if you have a hankering for fried-everything."
__label__5	Awesome food and very fresh. Been going here since I was a toddler and never a doubt where to go when I want pizza.
__label__5	This is my favorite Applebee's ever! I split a 2 for $20, an extra app, and 4 jolly rancher drinks. All under $35! Absolutely love love loved my time. I recommend Cory as my server. He was very knowledgeable and kind. Will be coming back for the great deals, and even better service :)
__label__5	Really glad we found this place. We are from out of town and I was really craving some good Chinese food. Their service was great, the food came out quickly and it was delicious!  I would highly recommend their Cracked Pepper Shrimp...YUM!!
__label__5	This is one of the most amazing things I have put I to my mouth in a long time! Can't wait to come back for another. This place feels like the things I know and love about brewery's. We also had the beer, well because it's a brewery. I did 4 oz of the sour, fruit, and pineapple mango cider. I would highly recommend all of them. I love that we finally have a great place to hang in South Reno!!
__label__5	"I've been using Yelp to find new place in
our neighborhood to eat. This gem came
up last week and I am in love with the place.
My wife and I had the Evanator hamburger and
the breaded pork tenderloin sandwich. 
Definitely the best I've had in a long time.
We are going to be regulars for sure!
Service was great as well. Gina's is fantastic!"
__label__3	I am disappointed with this Pinkberry because the owner changed the inside of the store to look like some Felipe's / Pinkberry hybrid. If I was part of Pinkberry corporate I'd be upset about this one franchisee tarnishing the brand.
__label__3	I've been going there since I was a kid and it's always been a good experience. Yes it takes long, but it is what it is. Everyone is always pleasant. Only thing, I literally just called to make an appointment because I haven't been in a while. No openings until Feb. I'll be blind before then lol.
__label__4	A bit high priced but awesome house band and friendly bartenders... a good time for sure
__label__5	I had the best server here. Lisa was very hands on and always making sure we had what we needed to. She was so sweet and very social and welcoming!!! 10/10 recommend and make sure to ask for Lisa!!!!!
__label__5	"Great fun!
Midge and Wren were really great!!! So funny and nice. 
Our group did inventors attic. They tell you the overall objective of the  puzzle room before you enter.
We did solve it in 25 minutes, which was fast. Many don't even make it out of the room.
I had a lot of fun, and the puzzles were hard. We were so proud as we solved each one. There were several different stages which kept us guessing, and you feel like you definitely got your $ worth.
I highly recommend if you're in the area"
__label__5	What a lovely, on-trend spot and a proud addition to the neighborhood. A sleek space with exposed brick welcomes customers before the friendly, knowledgable staff does. They are serious about quality coffee here and as a result it looks like a classy chemistry lab behind the bar. I had a Tinker pour over which was nicely balanced and flavorful. I also had the pepper scone, which had wonderful texture, with whole corn kernels inside and sea salt crystals on top. Judging from the quality of their coffee brews I can't wait to try a cocktail.
__label__1	The bowling alley itself is alright, but the employees are extremely rude and for no reason.
__label__1	I've had not the best experience my first time there. The place is absolutely gorgeous, original design idea, great atmosphere. The only concern I have is why were we taxed on just 2 glasses of bubbly?!? I work in a bar industry and to my knowledge there's no such thing as city tax nor state tax on alcohol in Nola. When approached server with the question she had no answer to it. If I'm wrong I'll change my rating bc obviously 1 star is for the taxes charge on solely alcohol.
__label__5	Just cashed out on on my 20 piece.  That bih stay hittin. Fit good like permanent.  All love
__label__4	Not much in atmosphere but consistently good food if you want a pizza or hero.  Calzones also good.
__label__5	I love this place definitely my go to sushi place if I am not too far away! My favorite is the baked salmon roll mmmmm best roll I have found
__label__5	"The breakfast was so good. We had the cheese grits to start and then the crab cake hash and vanilla french toast. Both were amazing and very filling. 

We also had no wait for a Sunday which was awesome.  The place is very large inside and they make a great vanilla latte. 

Also just so you know, the cold brew coffee is pretty strong."
__label__5	Awesome little tucked away brewery. A bunch of seating, great atmosphere.  May become a solid go-to...  beer is very good.  Great selection.  Super nice people working there.  Like it a ton.
__label__3	"Went here for lunch on a Sunday. The food was definitely bar food, but pretty good for that, and the location is right on the beach which was fantastic. 

Maybe they arent used to having a crowd there, but the service was REALLY slow. We were ignored most of the time, and when we did get service, our server was rude and indifferent. With so many beach bars to chose from right in this area, I'll opet for one that has a friendlier staff next time."
__label__2	The food was definitely less than expected. If I was highly intoxicated I could see it tasting a little bit better. The ranch dressing tastes like horseradish which is personally not my forte. The staff were however very friendly and our food came out fast and hot. I had the pulled buffalo chicken sandwich which was much more tasty than my friends Mac n cheese burger.
__label__4	Yum! The food, service and location is totally on point. The restaurant itself is pretty massive and even at lunch time it was 3/4 full which I think says a lot about its reputation and food. We ordered a veggie roll, sweet potato roll and avocado roll between the two of us and by the end it was a little tough to finish because these are nice, fat rolls. Thoroughly enjoyed lunch and our waitress was really nice.
__label__3	Menu variety is nice and I loved the backRoom club seen was pretty good but space is very limited and not the cleanest
__label__5	Not much else to say besides an amazing place...for free!
__label__5	Great spot for a delicious American fare! We love the family friendly atmosphere and the 50's Americana theme in the diner. Everything on the menu is great, but the burgers and floats are the absolute best! Nothing beats their Frostop Rootbeer Floats, my absolute favorite treat. Staff is friendly and food comes quick. Awesome place for a quick bite with kids!
__label__5	just stayed here again, spent the day by the pool. it was beautiful. freshly landscaped with a bar, it was an oasis. i found nothing wrong with the rooms. damn, and only 90 bucks. i love this place.
__label__3	"Saw Gone Girl here tonight. I have been to this theater a few times. It is not my favorite. I have had to wait in along line to buy tickets sometimes and I hate to wait. I have never seen the kiosk in working order. And they only have one.

It gets crowded on weekends. Weekdays it may be totally empty. But it is close, has a lot of parking and is AMC (I like the Stubs program). 

One other thing I didn't like was you can't raise the cup holders. Makes it a bit uncomfortable in the seats."
__label__4	I've been twice and I pretty much love this place. However like others say servers are spread thin and it sometimes takes awhile for them to come back over. The meat is delicious and the grill was changed and oiled frequently. I usually get the 35/ person or 45/person we don't feel rushed and have fun. Just bring good company and you should be fine.
__label__3	The food wasn't great. My chicken and tortillas were dry. However, the chips, the tequila sunrise, and the rice were exceptional. Not my favorite place in the world but worth returning to if I'm in the area.
__label__1	First time here and while I'm not a huge seafood fan, the rest of my party is.  The food was not all terrible, though I got sick even though I just had fish & chips.  The service was bad.  The server was nice but forgot several items we ordered and it took a very long time to get anything and when you have a strong willed four and half year old, sometimes waiting is hell.
__label__3	"The outside of the restaurant is a bit shady. If it had not been recommended, I would not have chanced it. Inside however, the owners have taken great pains to make it appear cozy and romantic, which it does very well. 

The food is decent, but more on the bland side, and absolutely far too pricey for the quality of the food. The food didn't take too long, but our appetizer was not as warm as it could have been. 

The service was fantastic. Our waiter was pleasant and very helpful."
__label__5	I can't believe something so beautiful and yet wild and untouched exists in the heart of the main line!  I decided to try the trail after taking Andy to the dog park and was pleasantly surprised how cool it was! It felt like I was adventuring through a huge forest.  So many fascinating things to look at and it's so peaceful!
__label__5	Really enjoyed our cemetery tour. Ty was a wonderful tour guide - friendly, enthusiastic and very knowledgeable. Great value! Appreciated learning about the historical facts. Can see  why thIs tour company is so  highly rated. You will not be disappointed..
__label__1	Absolutely the pinnacle of abuse of monopoly in the worst kind possible way. Highest prices for lousy service. My box has not worked for over a year and they have charged me twice the agreed price for the same period of time. Why ? Because they can. We need a second provider in Santa Barbara.
__label__5	Priscilla did a wonderfully age-appropriate corsage to match my 11 year old's dress.  Light-hearted and whimsical- she loved it!!!
__label__1	Bought 40k models from there online store when they arrived they were recasts that required so much extra trimming to be frank buying recast is bad especially when the product says GW on it grr disappoint
__label__5	Absolutely love this place! The atmosphere, lights, outdoor/indoor section. Perfect. They even play oldies. The place to be. Not packed like wrong iron & more lively than the bull dog. Perfect for all ages above 21!!
__label__5	This is a great dog park.  It's big!  Separation for large/small dogs, panty of fresh water in multiple locations,  and waste bags have been plentiful,  so far.  There is even a doggy time-out area.
__label__2	"Not a dog friendly brewery.  It's a hot day and we have been to several outdoor areas of breweries.  It's 88 degrees out but their asphalt patio  in the parking lot is about 105 at least. Everywhere else we were ok in the shade, not here. 

We were most excited to try this place but they would not let us inside with our service dog. I am writing this from my AC'd car while my husband finishes his beer.  So disappointed, this was on the top of my list for Nashville breweries."
__label__3	"Average but I mean all of it ... it is just average 
Too bad the potimtial is there 
should be run as a business and not a family joint"
__label__5	"Kaylee is the best server give her all the tips! 
Also try that spicy marg, it will change your life"
__label__4	Food was really good. Atmosphere is a little hole in the wallish, but not bad. Service could have been a little better.
__label__5	"Fresh handmade tortillas. Wow! The food is absolutely delicious: not cheesy or heavy. Prompt and friendly service. Professional staff. Wonderful!
Mom's favorite Mexican dish is mole and she absolutely loves the mole here."
__label__1	"This place ruined Mother's Day.  After calling for reservations and confirmation on three separate occasions (starting one month ahead of time), they still managed to mess up our reservation.  Highly disappointed in their response, which was ""sorry.""  No accountability or ownership for the situation, highly recommend skipping out on this sorry excuse for a high end restaurant!!!!!"
__label__1	"Service was slow and the hostess seemed to think my moving one table over in an empty restaurant was a big problem --literally one table, less than one foot! Unimpressed with the attitude.  I do not understand what has happened to customer service. Why oh why is the customer not wanted? ??
If you want mediocre Italian food and lots of it, you have found paradise."
__label__5	No longer 24 hours as of maybe October. They used to have employee til 10 pm.  But homeless folks took over .... not just that, but we're a problem, so it closes. Not sure what time last load it.
__label__5	My husband, daughter and I have been getting pedicures and sometimes manicures here at Best Nails for years! It's always been an enjoyable experience with professionals. Pam and Henry run a very good shop -- clean, safe, and they follow strict Covid protocols. Highly recommended!
__label__5	AMAZING!!!  Katie never disappoints!  Have sent flowers to my mom for her birthday and sent a sympathy arrangement to my mother-in-law when my father-in-law passed away and Katie hits it out of the park every time.  My MIL -- who is an interior designer -- said that it was the most exquisite arrangement she has ever received/seen...high praise from someone with a highly aesthetic eye.  Recommend Posh Petals without hesitation!!!
__label__4	Love this place. Best frozen yogurt in downtown! The owners are almost always there and are incredibly nice people.
__label__1	"Holy crap, worst employees ever. Went through drive through with my husband in Antioch, and this boy (adult man) cussed at me while repeating our order, refused a request for sprite saying ""we're out of f*cking sprite"" and was overall rude and unhelpful. I worked in fast food as a teenager, and couldn't have dreamed of treating a customer this way. What a mess."
__label__5	"Great food, drinks and entertainment! 

Especially when you have a BOGO.. My boyfriend and I both had  filet, lobster, shrimp and scallops combo for $45.00

Also the sushi is to die for!!!!!!!!"
__label__4	Go for happy hour! My friends and I ordered one of everything from the happy hour menu and spent only $15 including a Sangria. Great flavors and more than enough food!
__label__1	man. its a strip club called the red garter. what do you think?
__label__5	Great food! The owners are awesome and really care about making sure you have a great experience. This is the only Mexican food place I go to in Reno.
__label__1	Never going back to this restaurant again. They were extremely rude. They put a couple of tables together for our party and halfway thru dinner they took one of the tables saying they were very busy. 20 minutes later no one used the table . When I explained to the manager  customers ( my family started going there in seventies) shouldn't be treated like this she behaved like she could care less.  40 years of being great customers has comrcto an end.
__label__5	"This place is fantastic-I win a lot here too!  I also bring mom and dad every week - and they win too!  Loosest slots in Reno!
They have 2 dining spots I have tried- good food, even greater prices!  They take great care in making sure every one has masks on and social distancing while playing
Have fun and good luck!!"
__label__5	I found Monica on Yelp - I needed a last minute hair appointment and Monica was able to fit me in on short notice.  She had great reviews so I expected to get a good cut and color, but she made me beautiful!  Great, rich hair color and a cute cut.  Thank you, Monica, I've found a new stylist.
__label__5	Jose is a true artist.  He had crafted a slipcover for a bench of ours that had seen better days.  It now looks like a gorgeous piece of art for our beautiful office.  We have posted a photo in photos above.  We will definitely be using their services again when we need more work done.
__label__1	I'm a fan of Double D, but they vary from store to store. This one is a lower level DD, fo rills. Multiple times I have been served either sour coffee or milk. I'm not sure which one it was, but I DO know that the coffee was horrible and I don't go back. Go down to Broad and Christian, its 3 blocks away and much better (although much slower ... sigh)
__label__4	absinth was banned for sometime and now legal again you can find some places serving sazerac with the real stuff.  nothing like having a cocktail in the city where it was invented.  pork loin is surprisingly juicy and tender, probably the closest version of pork filet mignon in town.  the turtle soup here is also packed with flavor and hearty. bon appetit.
__label__5	"Very friendly and personable owner. Soups are made with love.

Best part is the free sampling!"
__label__1	"I went to go enjoy my coffee this morning with the new creamer I just purchased. 
I JUST OPENED IT TODAY AND IT WAS CURDLED! 
It does not expire until July 24, 2021.
I am so grossed out!"
__label__2	"I am giving it 2 stars because it has an indoor pool.  I do not like the fact that the hotel rooms do not have refrigerators, luggage rack, channel guide, and both the sink and the tub do not drain well.  I called for all these things. I was told they do not have channel guides and the fridge would cost an extra $20.  They would have to send someone up to fix the drain.  I do not find the staff friendly or helpful.  Very disappointing.  I have stayed at other 
Wyndham  Hotels and have been very satisfied, but not this one!"
__label__5	This place would be a winner in any neighborhood. I go most Saturday mornings for an espresso, fresh squeezed OJ,  and to pick up a loaf of their bacon gruyere bread! The staff is informative and kind.
__label__4	Pho is solid. We do delivery from them at least once a week. They're not cheap on the meats and veges, which is super nice cause Viet meals usually come with a garden. They're bang in is pretty good. Can't say their rice dishes are great.
__label__1	Homes are over priced they jack up the hotel rates and property taxes and steal everything they can from you as soon as I can get out of here I'm gone
__label__5	"If you're visiting St Louis or a local, you have to try Sanctuaria.

So many choices, especially for vegetarians.  All the food is fantastic, the drinks are delicious.

All the food I had, I had never tasted anything like it. And in the best way possible. It's delicious, and since it's a tapas place you can try several things. 

The vibe is very cool, kind of a Dia de los Muertos thing going on.

Definitely eat here if you haven't."
__label__1	Ordered take out Chinese and was very disappointed with everything. Got 2 qts of wonton soup with only 4 very thin noodles in it ,chicken was cold and bland but the pork fried rice was descent and it was a bit expensive. The place inside seemed nice and clean and the guy at the desk was very friendly.
__label__5	"I broken my screen for the first time ever and had to replace it quickly! The employees here are very kind and responsive. My phone was repaired in thirty minutes and came with a screen protector to avoid another accident. 

The employees wore masks, there was ample hand sanitizer, and only one person is allowed inside which makes me feel super safe in these strange times. Highly recommend!"
__label__3	"OK but not outstanding.

Fish was ok, not offensive, but the rice was mushy and ruined the bowl.  Poke King needs to find a good sushi rice and learn how to properly cook it."
__label__2	No parking. My wife and I went in - no greeting. Sat for 5 minutes - no service. One bathroom with a line up! Walked out never to return!
__label__5	This was one of the best classes I have done in a while, and I do a few every week. The instructor was very helpful and aware of our form and the workout was both challenging and informative. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone looking for a unique  total body workout and i will definitely be back!
__label__4	We live in the area and enjoy this place every once in awhile. The food is really good and nicely presented, the prices are what you'd expect for the Ritz. There's room for improvement on service. It's not bad, just slow and sometimes refills aren't as quick as we would like. The ambiance is nice-we like to sit near the large windows for the view.  I don't have a particular favorite dish. I've had a few and haven't been disappointed...
__label__5	"I come here all the time on my lunch break & I am NEVER disappointed! 

I always order the Pho Ga & it's so good! Just the right amount of broth, chicken& noodles. My food is always ready quickly which is great since I only have limited time.

The staff is always nice & they make sure you have everything you need. 

The decor is simple yet clean. Very spacious as well."
__label__1	I never write reviews but I have to let the ups know how inappropriate there employees are. I came here friday and was helped by india who was on the phone. I heard a converastion that a customer should never hear. You guys have gotta do better. We are not in the ghetto and her sexcapades should not be a topic when customers are around or at work period. This is insane dude
__label__3	Same good Dairy Queen food.  The interior was pretty worn and didn't look very clean.  The outside was also showing some wear.  We didn't get the best service.
__label__4	I've had Johnny's pizza on several occastions and the food is consistent and good.  Never had a bad meal and the service is very good.  The sauce on the pizza is what makes it so good.
__label__5	Great find! The pastries were sooo worth the money. I had an apple strudel muffin and my husband had the cream cheese muffin, both of which had amazing flavor. You can tell they don't skimp on quality ingredients!
__label__4	Went here this past Thursday and came across their $2 Taco Thursday's. Boy was it amazing! I highly recommend checking out their taco menu. A nice variety.  I will definitely be back to try other things on their menu. 2 thumbs up from me!
__label__3	Based on previous reviews, I was very disappointed. Cheeseburger slice was decent-size but who wants a lukewarmed slice (this was after the slice went through the conveyer oven)? Maybe it's different late at night when place is busy. Plus dough way way too thick and takes away from the flavor. Just alright.
__label__4	I feel like this is one of the best Mexican restaurants in Mt. Juliet, when you factor in the food and ambiance.  They recently added a nice covered patio at Los Compadres which really gave it a nice face lift.  The food has always been really good every time we go.  The fajitas are different then the other Mexican places around town because they use assorted peppers and not just green peppers.  It really adds to the flavor profile of the fajitas.  The staff is always friendly and fast.
__label__5	10/10 amazing bartenders and drinks. The Ramos gin fizz is worth the wait! Walked in on a Friday during the day and wasn't too crowded. We were able to be seated right away. One of the best bars in NOLA
__label__5	I visited Nashville last weekend for a bachelorette party and we ate here one night. It was a great decision! Atmosphere was great drinks were awesome service was amazing ! I would go back again!
__label__3	Ok tasting food with a variety of menu options. Prices are reasonable. Seating available on the main floor, upstairs, or outdoors.
__label__2	I eaten here a few times at the suggestion of others. This place is not very good. They try to be an Asian fusion place with sushi and some Thai menu items. I guess the sushi is ok but the quality of ingredients in the pad thai were subpar. It's edible but just not very good. It's a BYOB.
__label__2	I usually enjoy the food at Landmark Americana but this visit was a clear miss.  Some one in the kitchen couldn't stop sprinkling salt on everything. Unfortunately, the ribs that i normally enjoy were overly salted as were my fries and vegetables. Service was slow and spotty at best so I couldn't complain to my waitress until she left us the check. Since I've had many enjoyable meals at Landmark I will return to see if this was a bad day in the kitchen or if I should cross it off my list of favorite local restaurants.
__label__5	"YUM!  Fabulous menu and fabulous service!!!!

See photos I posted because they were gorgeous - edible art!  My favorite dish was the Monkfish.  I tried Sweetbreads for the first time which was very good.  I love that it's byob and cash only doesn't bother me one bit.  The servers were friendly and helped us make some decisions when unsure about which dessert to order (we got both, they were a hard sell)! I have been raving about my meal for the past week and I can't wait to go back."
__label__4	I used yelp to find a flower shop near my place. I wanted a bouquet within a small budget and they were happy to oblige. They were informative on what flowers were in season and they made a beautiful piece, with a variety of daisies, perfect for my roommate's birthday. My only suggestion is that could be a little more welcoming. They must have been working so hard in the back that I was waiting for a few minutes before I was helped.
__label__5	What a wonderful find. We came to a meeting in this area & looked for a quick good meal. What fabulous find- food  ~ fresh and very good-service- came in and had 30 min to eat a gourmet dinner. Perfect service in every aspect
__label__5	Ryan Jolsin, Heatwave Comfort Advisor, was so experienced when coming out to my home and giving me a estimate on my New AC System.  He reviewed my current system, made excellent suggestions and answered all my questions that I had.  He really made me feel COMFORTable in making this big purchase.  I would highly recommend talking to him before you decide on purchasing or upgrading your home AC unit. Thanks Heatwave for hiring him and sending him to my home!!
__label__4	Sushi is great ... we went for Hibachi the other day Sunday lunch, and it was a good time... our table backed up to the wall a bit tight and the heat was on super high, but the food and the hibachi chef were amazing.  this Ooka is a BYOB, I know the one in D-town isn't.  The edamame are great. We also got the BBQ squid app which was a nice helping and very tasty
__label__5	We love this place. The food is always good and the bartending staff is top notch. Dexter is the best!
__label__5	I loved our casual dinner here.  We sat outside, enjoyed a glass of wine while we waited  for our food. Nice tables and chairs.  Food arrived, super fresh and exquisitely seasoned.  It was a gorgeous evening and were so happy that, finally, an innovative chef and owner hasfound the the right vision for this beautiful and iconic spot on Milpas.  I'll be back soon. Today I had the crispy fried chicken sandwich.  Yikes was that good!
__label__5	"Fantastic small business, fantastic small business owner!!
Adam's Flooring did a wonderful job installing carpet and flooring in Hamilton Masonic Lodge #533. 
Workmanship was top notch, cleanup afterwards was excellent and pride in their service and installation was on point!  
Great recommendations of products for the needs of the lodge.  We are extremely pleased with the end results when finished. 
Thanks so much!!"
__label__5	Quick, healthy, and affordable... perfect lunch time stop! We both got the taste 2 special. (Half sandwich and soup) $8.49 each. Can't beat it!
__label__5	We're very senior snowbirds and after I had to take my husband to urgent care because we had no doctor they recommended Trish, the nurse practioner at Florida Wellness Medical Group in Carrollwood.  The staff there is very kind and caring, there is never more than a 5 minute wait and Trish is absolutely fantastic.  Not an alarmist and seems to get right to the problem.  I much prefer Trish and this office to that of our primary care physician in Ohio.  You can't go wrong here.
__label__5	This place is amazing!!! The food is high quality and delicious. I was thrilled by their attention to healthy ingredients. I had fruit, organic yogurt and house made granola. The fruit was a mix of apples, strawberries, banana and grapes. My husband enjoyed the breakfast burrito. And we shared a cranberry white chocolate scone. It was all fabulous. Cozy atmosphere and all. I want to go back already. I hear lunches are just as good.
__label__3	"Went back one weekend afternoon; food was some better, still not up to pre-hiatus quality.

Will still try once-in-a-while & report back here on ""Yelp"" !

Rick"
__label__5	Great little place in Seminole Heights.  Sushi was fresh and the hummus was fantastic.   The Arugula salad was a light and fresh.  Chef/owner Phil was really friendly and you can tell he really loves creating interesting food combinations.  We will definitely go back.
__label__5	A North-side gem with delicious food and a huge beer list! I had the Chicken Curry Vegetable lunch special and everything was great. The soup, the spring roll, the curry, great stuff!!!
__label__1	Friday I took my son in for dinner.  Place was filthy, no one came to our table, and we got up and left.  If you're not drinking at the bar then you get ignored.  So sad to see the place go down hill so quickly after new ownership.  Wish they would become family friendly again since Maplewood subdivision is directly behind it.
__label__3	My son s a big Popeyes fan so we frequent this location. The food is generally hot and fresh and they indulge us is requests for extra legs. It's fast food and sometimes the line is long, so I don't expect fine dining or perfection. This is a solid location that is clean with conscientious staff.
__label__5	Legend Club for me and chicken salad for the other half. Fast friendly, and delicious!
__label__4	Very good place. Friendly stuff. I would recommend gyro sandwich. You get very fast and good service. To go orders available also. I've been coming here and will come again. Im giving 4 stars to this place and to the gyro sandwich.
__label__5	Our second visit ... first the staff is wonderful...the food excellent once again we enjoyed a cheese plate...also had the Foie Gras.  Dinner was wonderful my husband had rack of lamb and I had the duck confetti.  The Chef actually came out and greeted as well as the owner once again.  Ryan are waiter was knowledgeable and extremely helpful with recommendations.  We are hooked...the food, the wine, drinks, atmosphere and staff ....it is quickly becoming a favorite place of ours!
__label__4	Great breakfast place. Good service, clean, reasonable prices. They place a small coffee thermos on your table for your no hassle refills. Several menu options. Very ample parking.
__label__4	Nice little local sushi bowl/burrito place.   They have many different combination to choose from or you can build your own.   Only thing is I wish they used or had a choice of sushi rice.
__label__1	Depended on Panera for a catering order for a team event. When the order did not arrive within the time frame their system threw back, they said it had already been delivered. When pressed into where, they finally acknowledged that they totally bypassed the order. Don't appreciate the mismanagement or the misinformation. Thumbs down and gave the business to Jason's Deli.
__label__3	"Love the atmosphere and decor!
Our waitress was very nice, kept our water glasses full and didn't pester us. It was a weeknight, about 6pm and we didn't have to wait at all, so that was nice.
I had the rolled chicken taco (loved it!) and cheese enchilada (eh, okay) combo. It was fine, not outstanding and did not live up to my expectations.
Next time I would stick with the rolled taco or the cheese crisp things."
__label__4	My go to for pizza delivery. Always fresh and delicious. Friendly phone service and reasonable prices. Sweet sauce, good crust (especially if you crisp it on a pizza stone at home) and fresh toppings. Never a disappointment.
__label__4	Good selection of beers and great atmosphere.  Cash only be advised.
__label__5	Paint Kings is the best painting company in Arizona! Super low prices and free estimates from Red Rock to Tubac you won't find a more competitive estimate.
__label__5	This place is fantastic! What a great menu but the service is outstanding. Fernando is an excellent person with a great personality and attention to detail! We are having an excellent time and this all adds to the pleasure.
__label__3	Prepare to wait 20+ minutes for a table even when you have a reservation. Nice. Food was ok. Drinks were ok. I did not make a reservation to just stand for so long. I will not be back.
__label__5	Chicken Madeira! and any of the cheesecake selections are awesome. The service is pretty good considering they are always sooo busy. The ambiance is nice-a little on the noisy side (again since they are packed most times). Something needs to be done about the floors though. I have almost slipped several times while walking to my table, and have seen other women come close to slipping as well. Other than that I enjoy coming here.
__label__5	You walk in and within moments are greeted by staff. A good looking establishment with great music playing - setting the tone. Bryce was over top the amazing, great customer service and made me feel at home  The bartender was amazing as well. . .Attentive and kind. I had the filet steak salad and it was so delicious! Definitely check this spot out
__label__1	My medium one topping pizza took an hour and fifteen minutes to arrive, in the middle of the day. I live less than 5 minutes away. When the pizza arrived, it was cold and not cooked entirely.  When I called about the delivery time, I was told to just wait longer because they were really behind. The delivery girl never apologized or mentioned the time, nor was I offered anything to come back (there weren't even the usual coupons on the box). I will not be ordering from them again.
__label__4	"Bus from Philly to NYC was nice. Quiet easy ride!  On the return trip back, we were early and they were able to fit us on the bus that was leaving a half hour earlier than our scheduled departure time which was great! The driver was extremely friendly and accommodating!
I thought the bus would literally fall apart if we hit a pot hole too big. It did a lot of rattling and there banging that was a little unnerving. But I popped my ear buds in and was back in Philly in no time. Would definitely use them again!"
__label__1	"Out of chili, never heard of a Wendy's out of chili.
Ordered baked potato was hard not cooked and even after microwaving at home still hard. Nuggets cold. Ridiculous, won't be back."
__label__1	So Chipotle has been doing this thing where every time we go the portions get smaller and smaller. They are even skimping on the rice, which is already 70% of bowl. I'm paying for a scoop of chicken, why is the scoop becoming a table spoons worth of chicken? I'm paying for food so have the decency to make it enough food.
__label__4	my whole plate of food was shiny when i got it, but some things on the menu are greasy (not all).  i enjoyed the food, as well as  three others that i shared the breakfast with.  the thing that surprised me were the fried pickles.  i would never guessed those could be so tasty, but they were!  mmmmm...fried pickles.
__label__4	I get gas here because it's at the top of 7th...  I see the owner more often than any owner I have ever seen involved in a business! It's always clean, always organized and the prices are the same or better than any other 7-11. The employees are always quick at the register and never stall the line talking to random customers...As long as my car takes gas and I live in Northwest Reno I'll be visiting them again.
__label__4	Incredible cocktails (the amaretto sour was fabulous). Very good food, but sometimes a little too greasy. I recommend the lamb and the sultana desert. The location is not very nice (I didn't like the surrounding parking lot) but the restaurant itself is nicely decorated.
__label__5	"Dope. As. Hell. 

Stopped in for a few drinks before dinner. Our table ordered Moscow Mules and Bloody Mary's, which were both equally delicious. They had a popcorn machine which worked out perfectly to snack on. The food we eyed looked amazing! They had a local vendor selling barbecue pork sandwiches that smelled so good, I kind of wanted to bathe in the sauce!"
__label__5	This place is delicious! I do not think you'll be mislead if you choose to eat here... so long as you're not a vegetarian. I think there are very slim pickings if you're not a meat eater. But, man, this meat is good! The mac-n-cheese is super cheesy, and there is nothing low-cal on the menu. Give it a try... and don't worry about your diet until tomorrow.
__label__5	I love this place! The quality of the services are as good as it gets. I have been going to Hannah for two years and won't get a cut anywhere else. The atmosphere Bandit has created is so welcoming and inclusive! They have a 'contemporary-retro' vibe and all the barbers and clients are so friendly. I highly recommend checking out Bandit Hair - you won't regret it!
__label__2	"There's a Fine line between trying to be the ""pizza nazi"" and being out-right rude. The pizza is ok but very greasy. My biggest complaints are the cleanliness of the place and staff attitude. Being treated bad the first 5 visits was a novelty, but now I realize they really dont care. Thats obvious by the dirtiest place to eat downtown. Well Ive my share of grease and dirt and happy to pay my $10 for lunch elsewhere. 

BTW guy making pizzas today looked and acted like he had the flu... Hope my pizza was cooked thoroughly."
__label__3	I have always been on the fence about Fargos, it is one of those places that I could take or leave, in the past I have had some pretty sketchy meals here not to mention some bad service. However, this Friday myself and some coworkers decided to head there for lunch. Although the service was pretty lax, especially considering the lack of patrons - the food was great. Everyone enjoyed their meals, and I can safely say I will have no problem coming back in the future.
__label__5	One of my favorite breakfast and lunch spots.  Quality food full of deliciousness. Their baked goods are pure heaven.
__label__3	We went to Crabby Bills for Breakfast. Had the grits so creamy and tasty. The French toast were a disappointment. All other breakfast items were just ok. The service was slow maybe they were short on staff. Good drink specials. We would go back for lunch and dinner to try it out.
__label__5	Starting with the scallion butter for the bread, then the house vinaigrette with blue cheese on the salad, onto the Parmesan encrusted redfish, and topped off with tiramisu. Your taste buds with think they've died and gone to heaven! Vincent, the owner made us feel like family. You simply couldn't ask for more! If you're in New Orleans Vincent's must be on your list.
__label__5	"What can I say? I'm completely thrilled at how awesome the sales associates are at this location. Super friendly and helpful! Even when I'm in and out 5 times in one day because I'm a complete scatterbrain, they do a damn good job of making me feel like ""oh sure, everyone does that."""
__label__1	They have 2 for 3.50 core waters advertise. I try to get deal it's not working. The store clerk tried using my points without asking when I tell him no he tells me the deal is over even though the advertisement is still posted and refuses to give me discount
__label__4	Cute little spot. They have a small food menu. Açaí bowls served in little cute coconut bowls. Ordered a Coco Mac and a Macchiato. Kind of slow because they were training all new staff. Kinda pricey too, $12 for 2 coffees, but tastes good. Friendly staff.
__label__5	Absolutely delicious! I had the egg burrito with Fritos and chili for breakfast. Service was fast and attentive. We really enjoyed our visit.
__label__5	Hands down the best gelato I have had. Their 'Rich, Black and Serious' is heaven in a scoop (one has to consciously restrain the mmmms...). Thai coconut is a good flavour to try as well. They brew some great coffee - the barista has a good ear for instrumental music. The Upenn location is high energy and fantastic all around.
__label__5	Today i went into the dealer for an issue with my battery tender. So they replaced it at no charge! I Must say this is the best Harley dealership hands down. Everytime I go in there they're always super helpful and are willing to answer any questions you have to throw at them. I purchased my 14 street glide from Sean Kerr, and he is the man to see! Everyone must purchase there Harley from chesters reno Harley davidson!
__label__3	There is not much to say about Gray's is a must if you are in the mooresville area. I love the atmosphere, service is pretty good, the people are very nice and the setting and layout is also great. Food wise is alot of sodium but overall you will walk out from Gray's pleased.
__label__4	we were there sunday afternoon and we liked it  we purchased 24 wings and they were kind enough to let us try 6 different coatings  we really liked honey bbq, asian fusion, and captain morgan.  did not care for mild.  if you like a sour punch i thought the salt and vinegar fit that bill.  service was ok.  there was alot of kids and families but i really think they are looking for that clientel.  there is a seperate bar area which is nice.  i wouls say more of a fridays copy then a actual bar that serves wings.
__label__5	"We have many places to get bagels In the area, yesterday my mechanic was doing a favor for me and decided to treat him & his staff to a dozen of Billy's Bagels, I had a blueberry bagel and ate it plain, it was soft, easily chewy and delicious and most importantly FRESH, you go to the other "" chains "" you have no idea what to expect and Billy's was a pleasant surprise !"
__label__5	AH-mazing. Everything we had was so flavorful. Happy and stuffed familia.
__label__5	I am a huge bagel lox fan, and theirs is perfect! My husband and I have come here before for their coffee, which is why I came today. So glad I read their menu and saw this!! The food menu is quite extensive for a coffee shop, and I love the variety.
__label__5	Awesome service,  very friendly! Food is fantastic! Love this place, will be back again!!
__label__5	Warm welcome. Great staff fast efficient service.  BYOB with beer outlet across the street. Tasty dishes.  Enjoyed house salad with apple pomme frites and delicious dressing, spicy tuna nachos and spicy seafood hotpot.  Looking forward to going back. Such a diverse clientele so much going on in the neighborhood. A welcoming exotic restaurant that cares about their food and service
__label__4	Always a nice meal sometimes the food is overcooked but a friendly staff and very tasty food great seafood bisque soup
__label__2	This place used to have the best cheesesteaks in my opinion. Now, I'm so sad to say that the chicken cheesesteak was the worst I've had. The menu says it comes with sauce and onions, of which there were none. There was barely enough meat to fill the roll. Never again, I've have found much much better food at better prices elsewhere.
__label__4	I was nervous to come here because trying new nail places can be scary. Small little treasure chest of a nail salon. I've been here twice and the first time I got a pedicure and an acrylic fill. The pedi was okay, but it was the most basic one. Second time I got a gel mani and it looked great. I liked that it wasn't swamped with people- meaning they could take their time and not rush. Looked clean and used clean tools. Pricing is pretty good too.
__label__5	"There is a good reason the car line in the summer is always so long. Locally owned and unbelievable combinations or flavors, toppings, and experiences.  This is an absolute must for any sweets lover.  Flavors  rotate in and out, always check their FB for that day's flavors.  

If they have blue moon you have to try it with the fruity pebbles treats! It is one of the best things I've had and it was employee recommend!"
__label__3	Saw Tanna for a brazilian and she was great, very friendly and made me feel comfortable during the appointment. I was a bit disappointed when I made a follow up appointment and got Christina. I had heard so many good things about her, but my experience with her was less than excellent. She barley said one word to me and did not waste time with small talk. Maybe she thought because I look younger I wouldn't tip well so I did not deserve top notch service, who knows? I ended up tipping 20% but will request Tanna from now on.
__label__4	The food was awesome! I had the chicken quesadilla appetizer which filled me up as if it were an entree. The prices were very reasonable and got lost in the menu. It was very extensive. We had a table of around 20 people, and our server did quite the job keeping up. Food took awhile but as to be expected with a table so large. Definitely worth stopping in.
__label__5	"Tried based on yelp reviews, Barbacoa taco was very good, Fish taco is their signature dish - excellent. 

I usually don't prefer corn tortilla but they have their fish taco chemistry down where everything compliments with each other perfectly - the taste of corn tortilla, perfectly crunchy cucumbers, crispy fish and the tasty sauce.

Very good service. If you're looking to eat local, eat fresh - this is the place.

No frills, reasonable prices."
__label__3	This is a pretty great bargain. If you're unfamiliar with sushi or want to to take it slow and cautiously, this is a great place to begin. All of the sushi rolls are modestly priced, so even if you're not thrilled with what you ordered, there's room for error.  When we went on a Friday, the service was lightning fast. I can't say that it was excellent service but in a place like this I certainly appreciated the server's quickness, even if it compromised his attentiveness.
__label__5	"I've been an on-again, off-again customer of the store for years, but that's due more to me moving then anything they've done wrong.

The store is large, clean, and well stocked. The staff is friendly and actively engaging and unlike other stores in the area don't treat customers as disposable.

Great place for anyone just looking for a comic book or to play a pick up game of Heroclix, DND, or Magic."
__label__4	I alternate between two delicious meals when I go there.  The chicken hibachi is very tasty and filling.  I use the white sauce with it for a little extra flavor.  When I don't get that, I get the spicy tuna sushi which is very good especially for the price!  The staff is always very friendly and service is quick.
__label__5	Nicely done on scheduled date. It rained that night. And JR came back out to fix what the rain damaged.
__label__4	Best banana pudding in town.  Banana is well represented in 3 forms in this dessert: a carmelized, ripenened banana sauce, a fresh and creamy banana pudding, and superbly done banana bread. Their food doesn't disappoint and service is usually good.  Other things I've had and enjoyed:  gazpacho with lump crab, kale salad, short ribs,  salmon (skin was amazingly crisp)
__label__1	It is noisy, the food is not that hot and, the service is even worse! I will never set foot inside their door again.
__label__3	The food is good, but they are rude and snobby af!  It's a bad look for the vegan community.  Seriously, every time I interact with the owners the snobby and miserable.
__label__5	Taste so good had to bring some home. You can watch the make them which is always neat.
__label__5	"Yesterday went for an omakase sushi dinner and were even more impressed with the quality of fish, the whole experience of this special dinner.
Chefs Jesse and Ito surprised us yet again with the presentation and of course the plethora of tastes.
We felt right at home each time we visit. Give it a try, but reserve in advance."
__label__5	This is a duplicate record in yelp.. Go here for the actual one https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Manila+Cafe&find_loc=Cherry+Hill%2C+NJ&ns=1
__label__5	Strong, creative and efficient.  The Crew was committed to getting the job done no matter what, it will all fit and it was done with a smile.
__label__4	Good food and good atmosphere. They have reopened from the the COVID-19 shutdown for outdoor seating!
__label__5	The Mediterranean Tofu Bowl is my favorite! It's so flavorful and crave it all the time! Sooooo good!
__label__4	Moderate hotel for for the price. The place was clean, staff friendly and they take big dogs. They had orange trees all over the parking lots I snatched a few to eat. It wasn't to crowded when we were their and close to airport. It's also within walking distance to some food places so we did not have to move the car. A good place for low price to stop in while passing through. A bit of a distance from highway but priced well for convenience. Also included free breakfast, they had good bacon and the place was empty, which was nice.
__label__5	Had a large branch down in my backyard. It was very hard to access and near a power line. Antonio and his crew removed it within 24 hours of my call. Professional service and a can do attitude. Would definitely use them again.
__label__1	Never going back. John Taffer needs to visit. The place smells terrible. I ordered food and waited for 35 minutes and then asked about my order and it was never made because the cook was too busy talking to peope in the front. As I was sitting at the bar, the bartender walked by me numerous times and never asked if I wanted another drink because he was either on his phone or talking to the cook. I asked for a refund and left.
__label__2	"Just few minutes ago, I just finished eating at this restaurant and customer service SUCKS!
Waitress are only nice to those American or like-American people and we are one of them and they don't even smile or greet. Food is not that great at all. I should've take pictures of those grumpy looking waitress. Never return and will tell everyone about it."
__label__5	Wonton soup and crab Rangoon were excellent! Pineapple fried rice was solid but it didn't blow me away. Super friendly staff! I'll definitely be back to try more!
__label__4	Clean, good atmosphere, nice outdoor patio with live music occasionally, big TVs. Cash only but they have an ATM. I always enjoy coming here.
__label__2	The inside is SO LOUD! Its a really nice building and lovely atmosphere, great waiters and service, good food that's beautifully prepared... it's just hard to enjoy your food and justify such an expense when if you closed your eyes you'd think you were in a cafeteria. They have outdoor seating as an option, but then your food is getting all kinds of nasty car fumes in it. Really wish we'd gone up the street to Dandelion instead :/
__label__5	The kids loved it! Kids friendly, where we all had lots of fun. We loved the squirrels!
__label__5	From phone call to texting it was very easy to communicate with Southern Belle Rose. They made sure I was happy every step of the way! I received a beautiful dress and can not wait to wear it to the wedding in September.
__label__4	Visited in November 2020 (sorry it took a bit) We went as a group and it was good food in a rustic restaurant. It is fir sure a tourist spot and the food was Not that remarkable, however I had a infant version of the normal drink (I forgot the name). The drink is what they are known for, but I highly recommend getting a smaller version of whatever the norm is especially if your not a drinker. I'm a glass of white wine kind of lady  and this drink was a bit too strong for my liking HOWEVER everyone else who had one loved it! Nice spot overall!
__label__4	ProTech recently installed a Nest Hello doorbell and outdoor cam.  Professional and knowledgable installer.  Punctual for the appointment. Easy to schedule.  I had a very good experience.
__label__5	Kory was my bartender last and that guy was the best sooo helpful ! Made sure I had a great time and was always on top of grabbing drinks very little wait time. Highly recommend going to sandbar ask for kory !!
__label__1	We had 4 entrees, two were terrible, two were good...but who wants a 50% chance of having a bad meal. The two veal dishes were awful; overly breaded very tough veal right from the freezer, one was presented as veal parm and the other as viener schnitzel.  The swordfish and salmon were good. Terrible odds for a good meal.
__label__1	"Look, this place is on the Penn Dining Plan. Food is terrible and outrageously priced. The ""Gourmet Grocer"" section has ridiculous prices. Bought eggs and chicken broth: $11. The eggs were rotten within the sell by date. Super pissed."
__label__5	Food was delicious but that vegan upside down pineapple cake was just amazing!!!! If you have a sweet tooth this is the one to try!
__label__1	The place is always packed, table was small for our group, the Philly stacker had no flavor whatsoever, the onionrings had no flavor at all, meat from Philly was burnt...
__label__5	The pho and the wor wonton soup are delicious! Definitely a pleasant surprise on my first visit.
__label__2	Went there for dinner on Sat, the service was slow and impersonal.  Did not get our bread until our food came. Ordered the 4 course meal, but he brought out the soup and salad at the same time. The clam chowder didn't have clams. Had to wait on getting drink refills, and more bread.
__label__1	So we're in Philadelphia for the night and order using door dash 2 cheese steak and cheese fries . One sandwich to have cherry peppers Fried onions and mayo, the second one to be basic cheese steak. What we got was 1 sandwich an order of fries with cheese on the side. And 2 cherry peppers in a baggy. DoorDash was no help in getting our missing sandwich. So we ate the one and it was nothing special very over rated and peppers in a baggy what the hell we have no knives to cut it up with and put in sandwich. I would not recommend this place or DoorDash.
__label__5	Everything tastes so fresh and so so yummy! The staff is very accommodating and super friendly ! Love going here !
__label__1	"Started strong. Loved the bagels. Now it's empty. We thought, ""score!"" 
It is empty because after 20 minutes, still no food. The manager tells me the cook burned the omelette. Fine, that still doesn't account for 20 minutes."
__label__3	"I like this theater for my movie watching needs.  The seats are comfortable. The staff are friendly. The theaters are at a comfortable temperature.

It is one of my go to theaters. I wish I lived closer, then it would be my go to."
__label__5	Best Strawberry Peach Mojito Refresher ever!!!!!!!!!  There's so many options to choose from and I am glad I tried this. This spot is amazing you will not be disappointed.
__label__5	"We went to both the soft opening and more recently to Sakana and we had a great experience both times. The owner was really nice and made a point to speak to our group personally. He also recommended some amazing rolls - The Lion King being my particular fave. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone and they have a great drinks selection too, particularly their wine.
We'll be back!"
__label__1	"I called the business and I was told they are no longer in business and ""don't call back""!!! He was extremely rude... just saying. No wonder he is no longer in business."
__label__5	Ordered the seafood platter. Nice atmosphere friendly employees very helpful on the menu 5 Tap beer and solid bottle list looks like they can make any cocktail that you desire a couple of TV to enjoy sports. The best part of this platter it's not all fried fish pilling over French fries. You actually can taste fish and not just batter. This seafood platter is how your supposed to make it it's something you must have.
__label__5	"Went for Sunday brunch. Don't let the quiet atmosphere deter you from the great menu which proceeds great dining. 5 stars to the cheeseburger- a John Belushi brunch if there ever was one. Crab omelet was equally good. Food was matched by great service and overall fantastic experience. 

Bonus marks for the champagne cocktail."
__label__4	Dog friendly on the patio (not the courtyard). Good service and margaritas, no frills Mexican fare, but you'll be happy with whatever you order.
__label__5	This place is an OUTSTANDING value for the money. The food is sensational!
__label__5	Friendly service, amazing selection and high quality. I have wanted to try ankimo (angler fish liver)  for quite some time and from my understanding its hard to come by. They had it , and it was fantastic, such flavor.  I'd. Honestly say it was my best dining experience to date. Did I mention they gave us free desert? Excellent establishment.
__label__5	Yaso is awesome! We've gotten takeout now for a few different dishes, and they've all been delicious and affordable- which is a nice addition for a restaurant in the area. The food is so tender and has great spice flavoring. The daily specials are awesome- and add some nice variety to the menu.
__label__5	Al Pastor taco are the best I've ever had The flavor was incredible , Not over priced . Nice job very impressed.
__label__5	I went here with a party of 6. We were seated immediately and the food didn't take too long to come out. My only complaint is the food didn't all come out together so some people were eating as others were watching and waiting. Aside from that, the food was pretty good and so was the service so I will definitely be back.  Their menu is quite big and there are many options. This is a very nice and clean local restaurant and I'm glad I stumbled upon it.
__label__5	Taylor is awesome. One of the most welcoming and a good conversation. The drinks are good pours and the music is amazing. I'd come here for the bar tender and drinks alone. I think this is the best mix of dive and broadway.
__label__1	I'd give them a zero star if I could. They suck so bad. I came in just to have a number changed. I didn't get greeted and stood waiting for too long. Then when someone was finally able to help he just sent me out the door because he said he couldn't change my number and the other guy was hard core flirting with a costumer when he should have been working. Worst service ever. Don't go here!
__label__1	"Hey Sprouts watching your employee wash a deli knife in the red bucket on the floor has made me decide your cleanliness standards need some work. 

Sorry no more sandwiches for me."
__label__1	What is it with Jimmy Johns and mayo you ask easy on mayo you get 1/2 a ton, you get mayo and it's a ton... ask to leave it off you still get a ton... problem is you don't find out until you're back at work
__label__5	"Excellent service. Yummy pumpkin blonde. Maple bourbon latte. Two egg and cheese croissants. Ohhhh yeah. 
Relaxing places to sit. Has couches and WiFi."
__label__3	I went to this facility thinking I was having a heart attack. They got me right in. 5 hours later diagnosed with hiatal hernia. They missed a major gallbladder problem. They didn't really communicate with my husband unless I asked the nurse to. The care was top notch though. The problem was 5 months later they wanted to charge me $80K! After dealing with my insurance company and theirs, they reconfigured it to about $5K. Just be careful of their billing company...
__label__5	By far one of the best restaurants I've ever been to. Food is 5 stars and the service is just as good!
__label__5	"This is the best ice cream shop I've ever been to.  The ice cream is perfectly balanced with flavor and creamy texture.  Lot's of interesting and seasonal flavors like salted caramel and chocolate toffee.  The cones taste like they were just baked within the last hour, so fresh and crispy.  The double chocolate chip cookies are crisp on the outside and chewy in the middle with an intense high end chocolate flavor but not overly sweet.  The best part is that you can order a ""mini"" cone and get your fix without over indulging. Definitely worth visiting when in the Santa Barbara area."
__label__2	"I am disappointed they did not explain medications to me. After looking online and seeing a MAJOR drug interaction between one I have taken forever and one I was prescribed I freaked.  I called them the next day and my concerns were not taken seriously. I will not be returning. I feel like their ""pharmacy"" should have checked this. Mine certainly would have."
__label__2	"Not really sure about this place. I think they are aiming for ""healthy eating"" but everything we ordered was overly salty - especially pulled pork. I needed to take half of my pork portion from tacos since it was too salty to eat - and I love meat. We couldn't even finish half of the food we ordered. Little disappointed."
__label__2	I went there for lunch today and found out that they changed the menu. Needless to say, I was highly disappointed at the fact that the one thing I eat on the menu is no longer there. They young lady ordered a Caesar wrap for me and had the tortilla taken off so I could have the salad I wanted which is the chicken Caesar with avocado. Bring back the old menu.
__label__5	This is a great little place to hang out,  have a coffee with a friend,  study or just grab a tea. The teas are delicious and healthy served hot or cold. The atmosphere is fun and inviting.  definitely a great place to go to brighten up your life!
__label__4	"Stopped in for lunch and tried the $8.99 Shrimp Tacos.  You get 2 huge tacos each stuffed with big shrimp and topped with big hunk of avocado.   Comes with your choice of about 8 different sides.   I opted for the apple Kale coleslaw and was glad I did.  

The tacos paired well with a Miami Brewing Gator Tale brown ale.  It was on tap and was velvety with creamy head and containing hints of chocolate & coffee.  Smooth and full flavor but not heavy.   

Next trip may just be a repeat order."
__label__5	Friendly staff....very well stocked and competitively priced. It's worth paying a few pennies more for the convenience of the easy in, easy out experience.
__label__4	"Fantastic place to go for a date..albeit you and your date must Fast for a few days but totally worth the caloric intake.

Service is to be expected with the price tag that comes along with it.

Food can be a bit salty depending on the cut and type of meat but overall good."
__label__5	Loved this hotel!   In a good location within walking distance of everything.   And having Luke Restaurant is an added bonus!
__label__3	We've come here 4 times and each time we feel disappointed. It's not bad, but it's not good. The outside is cool, but just missing something. The food is just ok. Since it's overpriced it makes it not worth it at all. We've had the Cuban, fish and chips, philly, wings, burgers, and pizza. Nothing was any better than any other bar. Drinks are always watered down.  We truly have no idea why it's always packed. Sucks since we really wanted to like this place.
__label__5	This is my new favorite place for takeout. Everything I've tried so far has been delicious. The kale salad is soooo good and especially if you add chicken to it. I love that there is a place I can order healthy food for takeout
__label__5	One of the best restaurants in Tampa! Authentic Indian cuisine at its finest. Friendly staff and a great atmosphere. Come on the weekends for the buffet to sample many different items from the menu! If you like it spicy they will make it SPICY! its definitely a don't miss dining experience.
__label__5	This place is great! New place to try for Friday Night Date Night. We had the sausage plate , Mac and Cheese and the fries. Super tasty. And enough to stretch out for breakfast and lunch tomorrow.  Food was hot and presented very attractive, nice server. Had a big variety of specialty drinks and lots of beer too.    Nice decor and had a table by the window for people watching
__label__5	Came here for the 630 The FAN NFL draft party. This place is awesome! The food is delicious and affordable. Their happy hour is AMAZING with $3 beers and $5-$6 appetizers. Plenty of parking, attentive servers and clean facility. If you're looking for a place with great food, great service and reasonable prices this is it! Definitely stop by when it's game day...there are TVs everywhere!
__label__4	"The Drag Brunch was fantastic! We had Nicole perform 3 sets and she was phenomenal. The staff was really fun and nice, as well as attentive to our table

The food was really interesting and unique. I had a breakfast quiche that was yummy, but wasn't anything special. The drinks were good, but not very strong. The dinner menu looks more diverse and I'll be back to try that!"
__label__5	Friendly service and delicious food!  They even make their own Gluten free bread which is wonderful!
__label__2	"Do you enjoy the coldness of ice cream, but hate the creamy consistency? Do you love the scoop form of gelato, but hate its deep and intricate flavors? If so, you will LOVE frozen yogurt, and especially at Kiwi, where they specialize in their icy, artificially flavored ""treats."" Don't forget to put LOTS of toppings on your frozen yogurt to mask it's blandness and completely confuse your palate. Sarcasm aside, the workers are really nice here. Too bad their yogurt stinks."
__label__5	This spot has good food!! I ordered the hibachi chicken and shrimp combo with zucchini and onions on the side! It so good. We only waited about 10 minutes. The only thing was the lady who took our order was a little impatient and kept asking did we want anything else while ordering. Good food for less than half the time at a sit down hibachi !!!
__label__3	I have been going to las agaves for many years but in recent months have been disappointed by increase in cost and decreased quality. Especially the smaller shrimp and less shrimp in quesadillas and shrimp tacos.
__label__5	Honestly - they have huge hearts and care for our two labs very well!  Labs - after eating rocks and chocolates.... or just annual check ups ....with these loving team .... our pups are still living the good life!
__label__5	Such a cool museum! Full of things that you won't see very often, if ever.  I will admit, I had to take a quick breather because some of the displays made me a little nauseous.  The panels are very descriptive, and I learned a lot.
__label__3	The service was quick burger was good. The fries while seasoned well were undercooked. Feeling a bit disappointed.
__label__4	Basic sports bar with good drinks and a laid back environment including a good patio area. This is a great spot to hang out and meet with friends before or after the game. Staff is friendly and welcoming.
__label__5	Great place stayed open after 5:00 on a Saturday, to accommodate us! Will be coming back :)
__label__5	"Cane back again with some friends for dinner. Service was quick and attentive, and both our sushi and soup were delicious. Unfortunately, they didn't have the Korean wine we wanted that was listed on the menu, but the hot sake was a decent substitute.

Most of the table ordered sushi, which was served attractively on small boats. I had the rare beef and meatball Pho again; there wasn't as much meat as last time, but the flavor was excellent."
__label__5	Haven't had sushi this good since Maui.  Ask for Sushi Chef Brian' and let him create for you ...
__label__1	Sales people and installers are nice but the quality of the product was poor.  All of their countertops are cut at their Oregon office and their craftmanship is very poor. You can check their poor rating as well. They are contracting with Home Depot and they can't handle the extra load.
__label__5	We loved that there was a fish tank where the kids could touch the fish, and the stingray touch pool was very fun too! The staff is very knowledgeable and willing to answer any questions. You must try feeding the birds, it was a highlight of our day!
__label__2	"Food was good, bartender/server was great, but after having paid for a meal for three persons .. when leaving we were told in very rude terms to leave the parking lot.  I can only assume that the woman who owns the place did not take the trouble to note that I was a customer and thought we were just parking in her lot..  After the way she spoke, I would have to say the first three letters of ""assume"" apply to her"
__label__5	This place is amazing. As good as it gets in Philly; from Dinic's Roast Pork to Beiler's Doughnuts - you cannot go wrong visiting Reading Terminal.
__label__5	Super delicious tacos! Crazy lunch crowd so plan accordingly but definitively worth waiting for.  Portions are quite sizable to keep that in mind when ordering. Love the variety of sauces to compliment the main courses.
__label__1	Horrible!! They don't close until 8 and they stop taking ordered before they even close. Ohh but wait they took the people order before ours. It's always something with them. I don't know how they stay in business anyways.
__label__2	I had the chicken Raman it was super bland & the drinks are way over priced, asparagus was WAY too seasoned, shrimp was the only thing I liked. So would I recommend it to anyone not at all.
__label__1	My friends wanted to go here and it was absolutely disgusting. The only good thing about my meal was my milkshake. The chicken was the worst and the restaurant was called CHICKEN guy the chicken was mainly bread and barely any chicken the fries were not seasoned good to pair with chicken. I'd much rather eat at McDonald's it was 57$ and not worth it.
__label__2	Cake was good but the staff needs to know how to smile.. customer service sucks... their chicken bun was pathetic... when they made a mistake with my son's name spelled incorrectly on the cake they didn't even apologies instead they wanted to verify the email that i sent to them. Even after getting to know it was their mistake of misspelling, no sorry or apology...
__label__5	"Maybe my favorite sushi place in the city. Prices are fair and the sushi is excelent with a large and ""LA style"" piece of fish on top. I was very happy and surprise when I ordered off of the a la carte menu. Honest to god good place with out the big name and big price...you can't beat that."
__label__5	Friendly staff, fantastic food. I had hot chicken tacos and they came with fresh ingredients, perfectly cooked chicken and a flavorful sauce. I ordered mild because I'm kind of whimpy when it comes to hot and they were perfectly seasoned for my taste. Very robust portio
__label__5	Lovely place. Excellent food. Excellent Southern hospitality! I think it was Sherri that helped us Def recommend this place to anyone. Crawfish pasta was a 10
__label__5	"My favorite grocery store around, but it does get WAY too busy on the weekends, especially Sunday mornings. I need to wake up extra early to go food shopping before it gets insanely busy.  
Prices are good, selection is the best, and the location is very convenient. This is my go-to grocery store."
__label__5	Like and Honey was delicious. The chicken and waffles were delicious and our server Terrence was a great.
__label__4	"Small, trendy place with a great atmosphere.  Relatively inexpensive, but also somewhat limited menu.  We typically order the flatbreads and a glass of wine.  The wine selection is very expansive.  

Overall, I would HIGHLY recommend Tria for a weekend dinner or late night meal.  The combination of social atmosphere, good food and wine, and moderate price make it an overall great experience and one of the best restaurants we've been to in Philly"
__label__5	i love this venue. its unbelievable that this one stage is grand enough for the most famous acts, but local enough for college bands. it's nice and dark, just like a venue should be. i can't think of any way to make it better.
__label__3	The food was just ok- small portions and eggs were overcooked.  Staff was friendly.
__label__4	Walked here for dinner from our hotel. It was all surprisingly good- the service, the food, and the atmosphere. Our server, Kelsey, was amazing and made our experience really great. Try the buffalo brussel sprouts, they were amazing!
__label__4	Had a blast here the one time we came. Would love to go back, but being so far away it rarely occurs to us to venture out there. I loved the modern twists on Asian classics. Lighting is crazy dark, but it obviously works for the venue's ambiance. Good drinks, cheap, and overall great value.
__label__3	"After checking in, this was the first stop on the way to Bourbon Street to pregame before the turn-up.

I didn't buy my drink, so anything free tastes good and the drinks reminded me of Mango's Tropical Cafe (Miami), so the hint of nostalgia was a plus.

I think I got a frozen strawberry something or other, either way, it was cold, sweet and alcoholic. 

I can't really remember much after that which means it was a great night!"
__label__4	"Great burger. I had the bacon and blue. I enjoyed this place, they offered local offerings and have great seating outdoors should you choose that.

Great kids food as well with a wide variety menu. Prices are great too, not too high or low. Service was also great. Will return."
__label__5	first time trying this restaurant and we will definitely be going back. the garlic knots were to die for they were so delicious, fresh salad with a great balsamic dressing and a very generous helping of spaghetti and meatballs for me and ravioli and meatballs for my husband. very nice decor beautiful and welcoming. waitress was a doll and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. please try this very good restaurant and be prepared to be very pleased.
__label__5	I love this place! It has been my favorite steak sub for the past three years that I've lived in Tampa and their coffee is to die for it keeps me up at work lol
__label__4	Started off with a manhattan perfect on the rocks. It was a fun atmosphere and beautiful looking people everywhere. Waiter was very professional and food was delicious. The location is awesome too. Recommended you come here before you hit the bar scene.
__label__5	Fantastic local joint and Family Owned.  Located in Feathersound so it's perfect for Carillon workers & people who live in Feathersound.  Fast service and quality ingredients.  Very convenient location for St Pete.  Price is reasonable and food tastes great!  I got the bowl with Salmon and Tuna and about  a million other add-ons.  I'll definitely be back!
__label__1	Imos sucks!  Rude and the cheese is disgusting!  Greasy as can be.  Enough said, other than it is way too expensive.  They are obviously relying on notoriety.
__label__1	Every table in the restaurant was dirty/not bussed, except for two. Servers were rude and unfriendly. Fries were hard and seemed days old. Worst of all, there was a bug in our soda!!! Gross.
__label__5	"I am always satisfied when I eat here.  The food and service are always good.  We went on a Friday night and it was busy but our service was timely.  
Outback has a full GLUTEN-FREE menu and every time I eat here, I test the food with my meter and it is always safe for me to eat."
__label__4	"Came here for lunch and was impressed by their location. Right near the water downtown. It was really wonderful to eat outside on a breezy July afternoon.

I got the curry of the day that was a green curry. It came with white rice and some sort of a crisp in lieu of naan. The curry was well balanced in flavor and extremely decadent in taste. I didn't intend to eat it all... but I did and I regret nothing! 

The price point was a little high, but I will be coming back here again."
__label__5	"Take your woman here for a date and you're sure to receive some late night...cuddling. 

Really though, the service was absolutely flawless -- warm and well timed.

There's something on the menu for everyone. 

It's a special occasion type of place."
__label__5	Awesome experience! Very cool - local dive bar. Had a great time and enjoyed the music!
__label__5	"THE BEST RED SAUCE THIS SIDE OF ITALY!  Bread, meatballs, and pizza are delicious, too.  Good wine list with many wines sold by the glass.

Service was efficient without being intrusive.  This place is located in a new strip mall, but the atmosphere is pleasant and the food is amazing.  Great value for the dollar."
__label__2	"Been here 3 times now. First time service was really bad...super slow for everything. They next two visits service was pretty good. 

To catch a game and a beer, the place works ok. But food is just meh. Menu tastes like nothing is actually made in house, just assembled. Atmosphere is so-so. With some work to the menu and actually making some dishes in house with some flavor, place would have some potential."
__label__4	"This location is incredibly hit and miss but today was a hit. My fiancè is a huge BWW fan so we end up going way more than I would like to. But we were seated promptly upon arriving and our waitress was very kind. 

I got the House Sampler as my entree and it was huge- I only ate about half of it. It was tasty though and provided a lot of options. My fiancè got wings and said they were very good.

Our server was very quick and our drinks were promptly refilled- usually a huge issue at this location.

Very impressed with our experience today!"
__label__2	Very poor service. Staff didn't know anything about the smoothies, or the juice. Weren't friendly at all. Probably won't be going back
__label__4	Delicious food and reasonable prices. Service was a bit slow but it's not a deal breaker since it was my first time there. I got 3 rolls of sushi and they were fresh and tasty! I will be back!
__label__4	I really enjoyed my sandwich which was the original one.  We got there as everywhere else closed and I'm glad because we ended up here and my sandwich was delicious.  We asked for a little more of the white bbq sauce and it made the sandwich even better. We will def be going back!
__label__5	"Went on a really busy day and still felt very taken care of. I've been to a few salons in the area, and had some okay experiences, some really good ones and also some really poor ones. This ranks at the top. I've only been once, so I'm likely to update this after I've been a few times, but the customer service here is what stands out. I felt more like an individual than just a set of nails, and the owners and the nail techs did a great job of this. 

Pro-tip: Make an appointment! They are busy!!"
__label__1	I ordered a Alfredo pizza with double bacon but it taste like double cheese also the guy who delivered my food (Wilfred) was rude as hell. He had an attitude like he didn't want to talk to me. Didn't like it.
__label__5	Last minute decision to call in by my wife and I and it was a GREAT decision. Fantastic prices, great food and an awesome atmosphere. Will definitely come back soon.
__label__4	Atmosphere is loud but fun! DJ plays great music. If you can call ahead  for reservations that would be smart.  We waited about an hour, but enjoyed the atmosphere. Dinner was nice, a little pricy for the amount of food. Service was excellent!
__label__3	Food wss just ok especially for the price we paid, mahi mahi was overcooked and calamari left a lot to be desired. The seafood pasta was decent, the best thing was the spicy shrimp app.
__label__5	Great atmosphere incredible pizza. The menu is imaginative and very differ from most pizza restaurants. My wife had the pear and procuitto pizza. It was delicious. Son had half buffalo chicken half meatball mushroom. Devoured and enjoyed. I went off the pizza menu and had the French dip sandwich. Very flavorful and tender. No left over beef here! They are very accommodating and will make substitutions happily if you like. Our server Hannah was professional, very helpful with the menu and did an overall great job.
__label__5	Fast service and knowledgeable tech who came out.  Good communication with the appt. He diagnosed extra issue I had with the rollers and we opted to replace them. Fixed the sound issue with the door with the tuneup he did. They wanted to charge a $19 service call which was not disclosed to me but they waived it. Will use again. Hopefully not for a long time though..
__label__3	Went there for dinner last night with a party of 5, not a long wait, maybe 15 minutes, this cheesecake factory is pretty big so the waits probably not going to be bad.  The waiter was friendly, we had a slight mishap when the salmon my mom order came out literally frozen on the inside.  They did fix that and the rest of the food is decent.  Sometimes chain restaurants are the safest way to go when your in a small town like Tucson.  Cheescakes food is never the very best but its just a touch over decent.
__label__1	Just about any Bdubs I go to is incredibly slow and poorly managed, and this one held up to the reputation. 7 dirty tables within eyeshot, and not busy. Slow and disorganized beginning to end.
__label__4	First time at Scotty's very surprised good service and good food. Had a cheeseburger with waffle fries good choice would recommend give it a try
__label__1	"Stoped by mikes a couple weeks back after being referred there by a local friend. Mike was very transparent over the phone and I thought everything was in great hands until I went to settle up on the bill and discovered what a massive premium he marked up on parts. It was honestly extremely laughable. Just know if you stopping by Mike's Automotive to bring your own lube because odds are your going to get ......  

CAVEAT EMPTOR"
__label__1	Terrible customer service, greeted by a rude worker at the drive through window. Refused to ring us up again for coupons; however, had no problem asking us if we wanted to pay for a donut they forgot. Also, they stuffed everything in the bag. Everything was upside down and deformed. Just go to the other dunkin across town.
__label__1	Over 3 hour wait and no food. The worst customer service I have ever experienced. Who runs this place?  Zero excuses for leaving over 59 customers in the dark for over 3hours. Guessing a ton of 1 star reviews coming
__label__5	Talk about super healthy & delicious food full of antioxidants & nutritions plus amazing customer service. We tried their warriors bowl, dragon smoothie & veg pannini as part of our brunch today and we absolutely loved it..we strongly believe in eating food that not only taste good but also supports healthy lifestyle for us without compromising quality. Must go there if you want to eat super healthy food without compromising quality and taste. Also, Owner was very friendly ,informed & customers oriented that shows that they really believing delivering quality along with great customer service..
__label__5	The food is simply amazing.  Very comfy and warm environment. Our server Tyler was on point, couldn't have asked for a better service. Will be back for sure!
__label__5	Awesome! My eyebrows have never looked so good! My eyebrows grow naturally in 2 different shapes. I'm constantly growing them out in the hope someone could shape them more evenly. I've tried countless waxing salons to get it right only to leave having  them looking worse than when I walked in. The employess listened to me, took their time, and I am 100% happy with the outcome! You can't beat $11 (just remember to bring cash!)
__label__5	I actually just ordered veal and chicken parm on grubhub and it was delicious.. love to try different Italian restaurants and this one is a stand out. Huge servings and they even sent a small salad, warm bread, gnocchi AND tiramisu! Such a sweet gesture and very good :)! Cannot wait to come try it out at the restaurant!
__label__5	When I lived in Reno I got an awesome sleeve from Mickey. It still looks great :) This shop is cool, good music, easy going staff, but professional and clean. I will certainly stop in again next time I am in the Reno area.
__label__5	Belle de Jour is by far the best hair salon I have been to in 60+ years.  Joel was welcoming and knowledgeable.  I had heard about his talent and decided to see what he could do for my fine and hard to color hair.  He did an amazingly beautiful job with correcting my color, putting in just the right amount of tones to make it look natural and soft.  I will go to Joel at Belle de Jour from now on, whenever possible.
__label__3	It was good, but not great. The coffee was good. I was hoping for more. I had the lox Benedict. It was good but would have been better on an English muffin rather than a bagel. The bagel was too much bread
__label__1	I have been going to Blaze for many years.  Most of the time I have been fairly satisfied until yesterday.  Stacy was my stylist there and she spilled bleach on my finger which in turn dropped onto my pants.   I understand things happen but she did not even apologize and seemed aggravated when I asked for something to wipe it up with.  I sent a message into the salon hoping they might try to remedy it but they did not.  I am so disappointed in this salon and will never go back.  Beware, their clients are not their number one priority.
__label__5	This is the best sandwich place ever-very good and nutritious sandwiches ive evet had
__label__4	I went here for the happy hour last night and was blown away. We got a spread of four or five dishes and they came out one after the other. It was all so delicious, especially the Edamame Dumplings. I would go back for those every night of my life if I could! Definitely going again for the happy hour drinks and prices.
__label__4	Friday was actually my first visit here and I can't believe I haven't been sooner! I ordered a slice of raspberry vanilla cheesecake to go and it was amazing. I love cheesecake and they definitely got it right. Service was so-so, but they were also a little busy so that can't be helped. As I write this I am craving cheesecake anddd they are closed :(
__label__4	I've been to a lot of Japanese restaurant in st.louis and this place is actually really good. I was suprised the beef ramen and the rolls. From now on, I am coming to this place
__label__3	The Muffs here are good, not great I think the olive salad and bread is better at central but at Franks they don't skimp on the meats like they do at Central.
__label__5	I totally recommend Andy for any of your furniture repairs.  I contacted him to ask some questions about our leather couch, loveseat and recliner.  The furniture was very expensive and it's been showing its age.  Andy was very honest with me and after reviewing the photos I sent, he advised me on a cleaning/conditioning product that I could buy and use myself.   After taking his professional advice, I'll save a lot of money.  I wish every business owner was this responsive and honest!  Thanks, Andy!
__label__5	Kyoto is one of my favorite restaurants in Boise.  The sushi is amazing (Marilyn roll and spicy Johnny are my personal favorites.) Relaxed atmosphere and friendly staff. A good place to go if you're craving sushi and you're with friends who won't eat it. The teriyaki steak is good too. Something for everyone. Family friendly as well.
__label__1	Came out to fix my dryer and was told it would be about the same cost to fix it as it would to buy a new one. I had him fix it, figuring I was out 250 anyway and at least I'd save the hassle of going appliance shopping. The guy installed the parts, then told me he needed another $175 in parts. Waste of time and money. Next time I'll go to Lowe's with my pickup and be finished in an hour.
__label__5	Ever since our trip to Venice, we have been searching for gelato that could compare to what we had in Italy. Cafe Crema was finally able to satisfy that craving. Their gelato is incredibly smooth and the flavors are all so pure and authentic. Along with their amazing gelato are a wide selection of baked goods and some fantastic cannolis including some monster-sized ones!
__label__4	WEM best location, good food for a food court, been there over 10 times.
__label__4	We wanted a light meal and we went here.  Very good sandwiches and a nice casual setting.  We enjoyed it a lot and recommend.
__label__4	For the money this place really is quite good. Having a kitchenette makes a long stay more comfortable. The staff are competent and friendly and the rooms are fairly spacious if modest. The rooms could be cleaner. I happened to have a hard floor cleaner and a carpet cleaner with me so I went ahead and cleaned the floors - and I was damn glad I did, but they didn't look dirty before.  If you're staying for a week or more nothing in Boise In this price range compares.
__label__1	Horrible, not professional at all. Would not recommend and would price around. The workers are not friendly and care about people's property
__label__2	Wanted to have a nice dinner for my anniversary and saw this beatifully decorated restaurant. I loved the fresh tortillas, chips, salsa, however, the service was horrible. This place looks romantic but not a good place to visit. Needs major work due to horrible service! If you just want some good fresh tortillas and dont care about the horrible service then go for it.
__label__5	"What can I say? By far, seriously, by far the best donuts in America. I am a doughnut freak. I have been in NY, WA. OR, CA. TX, FL ETC..........
Buries Krispy Kreme."
__label__5	"Great sandwiches!  I had the meatless Mike, the ""meat""ball patty tasted perfect!  My kids enjoyed the ninja turtle!  Wish there was a location on sacramento!"
__label__2	Terrible.  2 people. Both thought way below par. Menu from apps to dessert not the same as yelp or their website. Prices on everything we ordered higher than yelp shows.  Cheeseboard not even accurately described by waitress. For 2 things out of 4, we were charged more than the actual in-house menu shows. I paid $17 for a Caesar salad add shrimp that had awful spicy croutons and terrible flavorless dressing, also not the same as description on the website menu.  $97 later, I will never go back.
__label__5	"Thank you Chef Rob for the wonderful catered dinner in Nashville! My best friend and 12 of our girlfriends celebrated her bachelorette April on Easter long weekend and had Chef Rob come and make a fabulous dinner Saturday night. He was very kind and so very accommodating! I am a vegetarian and he went out of the way to make sure I had lots of vegetable options and lots of avocados (my favourite!) 
Everyone loved the food and the delicious flavours!
All 13 ladies had a great time! I would highly recommend Chef Rob to anyone in the Nashville area or visiting like us!"
__label__5	Took my 2010 Yukon XL to Ricks. Four kids with various muddy cleats all year round and the carpets were toast. Rick and his guys made it look brand new! I highly recommend Rick's service. Super nice guy to boot!
__label__5	Great food and people! We love the matzah ball soup and bagels. Also great breakfast!
__label__5	This is one of our family's favorite spots to eat Mexican food.  My wife and I have tried just about every item on the menu and everything taste great.  It has the look and feel of an upscale restraint with reasonable prices.  If it is your first time try the 3 enchilada meal it has the best commination of flavor and freshness.
__label__5	This is an amazing sushi place that has a great lunch special. The owner is very nice and always talks to his customers and provides free ice cream! Highly recommend
__label__4	"This is a newer restaurant so I get you're trying to attract people in. However the music was way too loud. My husband and I went for dinner and we were told it was live music. It was more so a DJ than really live music. If you want a club atmosphere at 5:30 in the evening then this is the place for you. 

The service was really good. We were seated right away and our server did great despite the booming music. We ordered the grouper tacos and the rock shrimp. Both of which, we thoroughly enjoyed. We also got a free piece of key lime pie!"
__label__1	Normally a favorite restaurant. Had a very important client with me today and even bragged about how much he would love the place but instead was paired with a server who couldn't have cared less about our experience. Drinks didn't come out for 20 minutes and one of our entrees did not come out at all leaving mine to get cold since I was politely waiting to eat. Will not repeat. Staff needs to be retrained on empathy with regards to table service.
__label__1	This company is terrible. My amazon order was left on the hood of my car in the driveway so after seeing who delivered it, and what time it said it was delivered me and five other people couldn't find it! Amazon  and nobody else should be using such a terrible service that has no respect for customers.
__label__4	Well, I don't think I have ever had bad service here. The wait staff are always so welcoming and friendly-a small town feel. I enjoy the food and the portions are huge. Fresh brewed tea for a plus. The gift shop is amazing. Really unique and cute things. Overall, everything from the food to the gift shop is priced really well. Only thing I'd like to see are a few healthier options, but otherwise it's a fun and yummy stop.
__label__5	Grbic Restaurant has the best food and service in town must try !!! :)
__label__5	Great Italian food.  The ravioli is to die for.  All the fish  dishes are great. The veal chop is large and excellent.  They have one of the best steaks in town.
__label__5	Jackson's is about as good as it gets as far as waterfront dining in Tampa goes. The sushi is incredible and the waitstaff is second to none. Jeremy was our server for dinner tonight and he was by far the nicest guy we met in Tampa so far. Can't wait to come back on our next vacation!
__label__5	Fantastic empanadas and a great margarita! Cool atmosphere and valet parking. Open air veranda upstairs.
__label__4	The food is great, its a st louis institution at this point, which brings me to the only down side which is that it can be a long line. It typically moves pretty fast. I love Pappy's, but I think there are other BBQ places that are equally as good but without the long wait.
__label__1	I've been here twice. The first time sat at the bar upstairs & had great service. The second time I Called ahead to ask if dog friendly & they said yes  downstairs! We went on Sunday evening and sat downstairs for about 10 minutes and no one ever greeted or served us even after we let them know upstairs we were there. The only person downstairs was someone taking apart a bar :(
__label__4	Good food! A very good taste of Vietnamese cuisine, with extremely fast service and a friendly inviting atmosphere. Definitely worth a stop by
__label__1	Awful service. They schedule you 30 minutes prior to your actual appointment for paperwork that takes 5 minutes. Then you sit and wait. And wait. And wait some more. One doctor is on staff that is supposed to see 4-5 patients that have been scheduled at the same time. This business needs to close.
__label__2	"Very fun tour but much credibility was lost after asking other locals verifying questions after the tour that were unanimously shot down as false. Additionally, I was referred to, by the tour guide, the absolute worst taro card reader who was supposed to not be a ""quack"", yet was a total belligerent drunk and talked about herself the entire time. What a scam. Skip the tours and readings and just enjoy NOLA!"
__label__1	I had fillers and botox at Success by Design. It did not work at all and I spent a lot of money!!! Two of my friends had the same experience. Their products are not effective. Please don't waste your money like I did!!
__label__3	Very sweet restaurant owners but the quality of the sushi/sashimi is sub par. Location is great though!
__label__1	Management is trashy, they forget stuff constantly and when ordering Uber eats just expect your order to be wrong and then have to pick up anyway. When you call them they don't really care and tell you to come in to pick up.
__label__5	Get the chicken and waffles eggs Benedict. Best breakfast in Philadelphia.
__label__5	Amazing fun place to dine and drink until 2am in St. Pete! Awesome atmosphere, great music, sports TVs, and great food!! I absolutely loved their Mediterranean dip platter (their hummus and tzaziki sauce iS incredible!!) Service is top notch and they even keep the kitchen open late to feed us! Love this place!!! Definitely going back!!!
__label__5	The Diner is in the back of the Casino. The Casino is a real dive but don't let that stop you. Small place get a seat and watch them make you meal. The waitress and Chef we real friendly. Great service. Got the Auful Auful. Burger. Yep that is the name and not a description. It is huge and incredible. Can't wait to have another. Try it
__label__5	The absolute best salon in this city! Mark Massa and his incredible team of stylists have created a space that's welcoming, professional, and so uniquely beautiful. It's truly like having your hair done in a rainforest in all the best ways. Besides being visually stunning, the entire staff is well trained, professional, and extremely talented. Don't trust your locks to anyone else!
__label__5	I'm really glad I stopped in here after visiting Lee Lee and getting some groceries. The ribs were great, the price was right, and the dude behind the counter was warm and friendly. I'll be back, and hopefully they have duck next time.
__label__4	My favorite el maguey.  The food just tastes better.  The only issue- sometimes it gets crazy busy.  Last night, we were put on a waiting list with a buzzer and waited over 45 mins even though we were told it would be 15-20 mins.  Luckily my husband went up and checked and they had never recorded our buzzer number.  The hostess was apologetic and got us seated immediately though.  The queso is amazing and I like the salsa so I prefer my salsa more puréed.  I almost always get the chicken chimichanga and it is perfect.  Reasonable prices as well!
__label__5	Finally its open!  Nice layout and more spacious than other locations I have seen. They have fantastic looking dry aged beef
__label__4	I've been wanting to try Merchants for awhile now and we finally went for my birthday.  I ordered based on recommendations on yelp and thought the food was pretty decent but not amazing: Duck fat tater tots, fish tacos, and blackened tilapia.  Best part by far was the drink selection...I had two really tasty drinks both with St. Germaine in them (its a fav) and they were AMAZING.  Service was also really good, which is always a plus.  Will likely return and try a different app/entree combination.
__label__1	I won't be back. While waiting for my sandwich, an employee (who said that he's the owners' son) unleashed an expletive-laced rant that went on for about 5 minutes about a confrontation that he had with another customer who complained about his MAGA/Trump hat. Politics aside, it was unprofessional and really unpleasant. Taking my business elsewhere.
__label__4	My daughter and I just had our nails done. Really nice. I had a shellac and the manicurist was very attentive to detail, gentle, not abrasive like I've had in the past. My daughter is very hard to please and left happy!
__label__2	Ususally a long wait so we went on Sat. afternoon. Plentiful seating but we were told our pizza ( 2 item) would take 45 minutes. Since we couldn't wait we had sandwich. later, manager told us a large take out order had caused a delay . Be aware- if you drive there and show up in person - your order  will be considered last!
__label__5	Another Florida favorite! Delicious, fresh, very reasonably priced food. Good service, always friendly.
__label__2	This is my third time visiting. I delayed in writing this....but it is 104 degrees out today and I am sitting here - with NO air conditioning. Only ceiling fans and open doors. Need I say, it is unpleasant! Just plain hot!
__label__5	Buck's has my business....honest, kind, courteous, communicative and great service. Buck's provides everything you want and need for your college kids car, especially if you as a parent live across country. Highly recommend!!!
__label__5	The owner was absolutely delightful & has an awesome business model. I was greeted & offered wine or infused water. I'm a connoisseur of nail salons & this is the nicest, most beautiful salon in STL. Love the space & am excited to continue getting wonderful mani/pedis at your salon! Thank you to the owner & staff for a wonderful experience!
__label__2	"So, this particular Wendy's lacks in so many ways...here, I'll tell you why:

They are often out of things, like potatoes, Frosty's. WHAT. 
And then the drive thru workers are generally very short and abrasive, rather rude more often than not.

Meh."
__label__4	This place has really good food. It was very empty on a friday night but they attended us quickly and the food was done fast too. Great authentic Mexican food.
__label__5	"I had an excellent experience with Whitman Appliance Repair. My double oven control panel was displaying ""feature not available"" when I pressed the bake or broil buttons and would not turn on.  Tony arrived within the appointed time period and had my ovens up and working in a short time. After one question, he pinpointed the problem and resolved it. I am very pleased with this company's work."
__label__3	DO NOT EAT HERE FROM 2-4PM - RICE IS CHUNKY. I usually love this place during lunch time (rice is well done, chicken has great flavor, sauce is just right). However, when I ordered today at 3:30, I was very upset at how clumped together my rice was. I picked out the rice and just ate the chicken. PLEASE use fresh rice, do not use leftover rice because that ruined the overall positive experience I usually have at this place.
__label__4	Stumbled across this restaurant while visiting the WW II museum. Very friendly service and fun names for menu selections. Had the Frenchy ( foie gras on a burger which I couldn't pass up - but it sounded better in theory than it tasted in practice - though still good). Kids meal is served in a cute lunch box. Mac n cheese was okay but one of the heavier preparations I've seen. Our group also had the Perfect Pig Po Boy which was also good. 3 stars for the food; 4 stars for the cute atmosphere and friendly service (Amanda was our waitress).
__label__3	"Kind of weird . 

First off plan to take the subway and walk down or good luck trying to find street parking . There is a lot you can park at however be prepared to spend 15 - 20 dollars. When I first walked in I was greeted by a long cheetah style curtain followed by the hostess that comes out of no where , kind of weird . However, the environment is dark and the tables are so close together that it makes you feel so uncomfortable. Regardless the burger was  great as well as the service."
__label__5	Where to begin? This is the most service oriented service department we have ever encountered. To name a few names who have gone above and beyond the call of duty for us: Brad, Stephanie, Cesar, Eric. Our story is long and painful but the end result was wonderful thanks to this great team. We bought a used Thor motorhome from them (and by the way, their Sales department is every bit as great), we will always return to Freedom RV for service rather than going to a Thor dealer.
__label__4	Definitely one of my favorite sushi spots. Not your high end sushi, but always delicious and cheap. Definitely recommend the rock & roll and any of the rice dishes
__label__4	This is our first time here. Although we have to wait in line but the hostess is very friendly. We ordered the dishes which marked as most popular menu like Bang Bang Shrimp and Tilapia Imperial. Both of them are great especially the Bang Bang Shrimp. Fried shrimp perfectly matches the sauce, totally worth every penny. The service of the waitress is just OK so I give four stars to this restaurant. However, I highly recommend the Bang Bang Shrimp.
__label__4	Sadly, they took away the discounted appetizers during happy hour and everything is full price...definitely not coming here as much because their appetizers are expensive!!
__label__1	"There is a mouse in my room!!!!
So I'm in Tucson for work and this hotel was at a good price and usually clarions are decent hotels, but in this particular one I have a mouse in my room. This is a disgusting hotel. I do not recommend it at all unless your a hippie and you like stuff like this. It's a very dirty environment and just very low budget. There's plenty of other hotels in the area that have to be better then this one. Don't be cheap...spend the extra money!"
__label__5	I was referred to this place by a friend of mine, and man am I glad I went. The sandwiches are some of the best I've ever had. They use a wide variety of ingredients and use them to create sandwich masterpieces. I had the southwestern club which blasted my tastebuds into heaven. The customer service is top notch with staff who are friendly and know their products well. The decor is modern and clean. You are almost guaranteed to leave in a better mood than when you came in. Do not hesitate to try it out, you'll be glad you did.
__label__4	Enjoy the personal touch every time I come in. My new spot to pamper myself a lil bit...
__label__5	Great coffee, fun choices such as Almond Joy and Teddy Graham and a wonderful latte. Great food - freshly made on site by a real cook.  Delicious veggie egg sandwich.  Super nice friendly people working there.  Loved this!
__label__4	"Had the Bello Bistro (a big mushroom sandwich). Loved the mashed roasted arugula, great touch for a veggie sandwich. 

The price is very reasonable. The ""healthy"" drinks better be as healthy as they are disgusting, because they are THAT disgusting. 

Service is fast and friendly. Ingredients tasted pretty fresh.

My girlfriend did like the healthy drinks though, because she's weird and actually likes the taste of kale. ""The lemon and agave makes the kale taste not too overwhelming."""
__label__5	I love the almond macaroons and their gelatos are excellent. This was a great recommendation from our #sidewalkfoodtours guide
__label__5	Erin keeps delivering great haircuts. She's always booked up, so make an appointment. Highly recommended.
__label__3	I have been here twice and both times I have left satisfied. Big, roomy, friendly and fast service. Very clean place too, I don't know why but I always look for dust build up. The apps are great. Tonight we got the sampler app and it was so good! The ?OscoBuco? was VERY moist, meaty and delicious. I find them reasonably priced. We will be going back for sure. My one complaint tonight would be the corn on the cob, it was laughable.
__label__1	Horrible service. Horrible food. They keep the lights off in the drive-thru so you think they're closed and drive by; it makes their jobs easier.
__label__5	"Their meatballs are amazing. Pasta is delicious, and homemade. My husband ordered the steak and it was perfect. 

You definitely need a reservation on the weekend.

 Live music was wonderful.  The Pianist had an absolutely wonderful voice. It was such a great place for me and my husband to go on a nice date. Clean, and professional environment. I cannot wait to go back and try their Seafood.

The price was reasonable for the quality and amount of food that you get"
__label__5	The review is for the service department. I had an excellent experience getting my car serviced here. Antoine was very professional, courteous and patient with all the issues and requests I  threw at him! He was knowledgeable about the way features worked in my car and common issues customers experienced. He assisted with audi valet car drop-off also when I couldn't make it in. I'd highly recommend this dealership and Antoine for your service needs!
__label__5	"Best taco truck around! We love coming to this taco truck!  Great prices and by far the best ""Mexican"" food around, and BYOB or margaritas too!"
__label__5	My partner and I are really sick, sore throat and all. We stopped at this Starbucks and were delighted to meet this amazing barista named Natasha. Five stars for her amazing personality, beautiful smile, and exceptional customer service skills!!!
__label__5	After struggling for months with the decision to put our 15 year old rescue dog to sleep, I sent Dr. Kirt an email just wanting more information. She immediately called me and after a few minutes on the phone I realized she would be our angel. She was kind, compassionate and incredibly gentle and sincere. It was a beautiful way to end our dog's special life with us. I would recommend her without hesitation
__label__2	Out of all the locations in Indianapolis this is the worst when it comes to customer service. I have ordered twice now (called in) only to get there and my food not be ready (I even show up 5 minutes late) the one off of old meridian is always a great experience , maybe I'll just order from there from here on out
__label__3	"It was decent. The house dressing is awesome!

My lasagna was just average. Nothing special and even though it was barely busy - service was slow and inattentive - which turned me off"
__label__5	Excellent food!! 3 of us stopped in yesterday after attending and honoring a Godfrey firefighter that was killed in the line of duty. We are not from Godfrey, but from other towns. We were in our Class A's. Not only was the food great, but the owner would notet us pay for our lunch. We will be back, and I encourage everyone to give this restaurant a go!!! Thanks to the Owner!!
__label__5	It absolutely lived up to our expectations in every aspect.  The salatim had unique twist to the traditional dishes.  The hummus was extremely fresh, warm, and very refined. The lamb shoulder was superb - tender, smokey, delicious pomegranate glaze... it's a must if available.  The deserts too were no a second thought - I in particular loved the coffee mousse.  The service was outstanding - every wait staff was professional, attentive, and flawless.  My foodie Israeli husband and I left the restaurant extremely happy and satisfied.
__label__1	Worst experience of my life. I had to spend three days in Brandywine's psych unit. The nurses were all miserable and snapped every time I asked a question. The text weren't helpful and I couldn't even see a doctor until my second day there. The facility was also dirty and there was never any food to eat  between meals. Some of the other patients who were there would tell me that they were on so many different medications and that they felt drugged up all the time and I could tell that they were.
__label__4	One of the best new restaurants I've been to in the city. Really cool decor, and great background music. The cornbread, charred cabbage and gnocchi are all excellent. Great addition to Oak Street
__label__5	Always enjoy coming here, the service is always superb and the food is amazing.  Our server Caleb was exceptional.
__label__5	Stopped into Indianapolis for a convention. Plat 99 has great brews on draft, a comfortable atmosphere, and some truffle oil popcorn you HAVE to try.
__label__1	The only reason why I gave one star is because no stars was not an option. First off, this devil woman was serving us drinks and did not even know how to make a proper vodka and cranberry that was overpriced and watered down. I handed her $10 for a $9 and she kept my dollar that I did not intend on giving her. To put it simply, avoid this place if you are under 45.
__label__4	This was our first time back since they have renovated everything.  We were seated on the 3rd floor and what an amazing view it was.  There was a gentle breeze blowing off the gulf and it felt like you were on a cruise ship.  The staff and our server was very nice.  The food was excellent.  Definitely the best fried shrimp in Clearwater!  Whether you are a tourist or local, it is worth the visit.  We will definitely be back!
__label__5	I have had five vehicles tinted here over the years. All of the tint aged well without bubbling or fading. My first vehicle has 19 year old tint that still looks great and they just did my new car a few months ago. They get the job done in a reasonable amount of time. I would highly recommend using this company for your tinting needs.
__label__4	"Phenomenal burger! Went there for the first time last night. Place was packed! Had the option of sitting at bar vs 25 min wait for a table. Opted for the bar.
I had a medium rare Juicy Lucy w/o bun on a bed of fresh greens. It was great! Cooked exactly as ordered!
Had a side of coleslaw that I won't order again. Was far too hot for me. Broccoli looked good.
Will definitely return on a regular basis!"
__label__1	I dont get the positive reviews.   Took the woman over an hour for a basic mani.  Just a mani - nothing feet, no waxing and I didnt have gel on before.  Complete waste and the polish job was one of the worst id ever seen.
__label__4	Great place to get some good makeup at a pretty reasonable price point. I usually get my eyebrows down which always come out great. The team there are good too. Check them out
__label__2	I wanted Spanish food today,  unfortunately in an hour there aren't many places to go in Brandon. I haven't been here in a while, but decided I'd try today. I'm officially  NOT a fan.
__label__4	Happened on this elegant Mayan place while strolling hip Magazine st. Great menu - about 10 varieties of guacamole.  We had 2 different tamales and some yuca frita as well. All good. Really sweet people too. Highly recommended.
__label__5	Friendly service, thorough exams, small business, works with my insurance, handles most requests over the phone (when appropriate), and some after-business-hours availability.  Overall a great place, and a fantastic neighborhood optometrist.
__label__5	The signature Zinburger, a My Boy Blue burger, a big pile of zucchini fries, and a prickly pear margarita. Life is GOOD!
__label__5	Excellent food.  Diverse menu.  Super appetizers for a snack or pre meal.  Try their Tuscan wings and their meatball.
__label__4	"Beautiful property to tour in the outskirts of New Orleans. NOT a plantation home.

Took a very informative 45 minute tour with Sue. House was air conditioned and has lots of interesting trinkets inside. They let you go in most of the rooms. No photos. :/

I wish it were self-guided but they rarely are.

Grounds were probably the best part; be sure to make time for them."
__label__3	Healthy sprouts roll alert!! So spicy inspite of telling them my spice levels. They should really start paying attention to the spice levels and not serve something just because it is already prepared. Their lassi's are alright and food is quite reasonable.
__label__1	"The absolute rudest customer service ever!  Their way of advertising is very unethical, their service was below average. The amount of chemicals poured into the pool makes the pool not usable for days after.  The owner, Derrick, instead of trying to empathize with the customer berated me for not ""memorizing their flyer for advertising that advertised their prices"".  You get what you pay for, they are the cheapest but that is not always the best..................STAY CLEAR!"
__label__3	We came for devour. The server was super nice and talked me out of the devour because he felt I should experience something else on the menu. He was right. The food was great and we enjoyed the environment. The downside was the margarita. It taste like pure marg mix and no tequila. We even bought extra shots to be put inside and it still wasn't quite right. But definitely eat.
__label__5	"Nearby and always welcoming, The Goat is ""our place"" to go for a nice meal. I love the Korean wings, and my wife loves the cauliflower as appetizers. 

We will invite our out-of-town friends here. 

Service is always good and generally we don't wait long for a"
__label__3	I recently purchased the groupon to receive a shellac manicure. As soon as she finished, I realized the nail polish was not placed down to the root of the nail. It was as if the shellac had already grown out. It has now been a week since I went in. The shellac has chipped on 3 nails and the color is extremely grown out. This type of manicure is supposed to last at least 3 weeks. Considering the fact that I only payed half of the price, I do not mind as much. I would never come back and pay the full amount.
__label__3	This is the second time for me here in Sorrentino's downtown and it is a nice setup and the food they serve is good. I mention the setup, since the place feels clean and has warm staff. The food as such was not over the top, but definitely not disappointing. My colleagues liked their food as well. I still rate Pazzo Pazzo slightly over this place. Something about first impressions, hard to change. :)
__label__1	I was extremely disappointed with my visit. Starting with the woman who saw us to our table--she was extremely rude. They lost my food, but eventually found it and brought me enchiladas that had been melting under the head lamp for too long and I found a bone in my shredded chicken. They completely forgot my friend's order. The waiter himself was nice but it was impossible to hear anything and I never got a refill of my drink. Poor service, Subpar food.
__label__4	I love it here, Peggy is wonderful and always remembers me. Love the food and the service is great.
__label__5	"Love this pizzeria! So cute inside, extremely friendly owner and in the warmer temps the alfresco dining is a nice treat. 

I typically get the pizza with the prosciutto and arugula which is delicious! 

As with all restaurants it Pitman, they are BYOB"
__label__3	"The men's locker room smells horrible. Not sure if it's the way the bathroom stalls is set up right in front of the entrance. 

The way the mirror are lined up, you want see your perfect reflection if you stand right between where two mirrors are placed together. 

Some pads on the equipment are worn off.

Good: i really like how some of machines are better than other PF. It's a big up. Staff is nice.


A few pads has been changed to new ones. & Mens Locker room doesn't smell anymore. Nice."
__label__5	It's pretty solid as far as Cracker Barrels go
__label__5	MaidPro, you did a fantastic job cleaning our home after we moved out. Everything was shining head to toe thanks to Yolenny Quinones and Marielys Castro.  We know the kids play room must have taken a little extra elbow grease to get a clean, but you did it. We're very pleased!!
__label__5	This is as good as it gets!  The food is fabulous, the wine incredible, and the service first class.  We try to go here at least monthly (belly up to the bar), and have introduced many guests to this amazing place.
__label__5	Such an awesome joint, great food, great crows in the bar area.  Would definitely be back here whenever im back in Nashville.
__label__5	"I visited Bloom this week. I work with children and adults who are differently abled so I looked forward to supporting the cafe. I did some work there and had a breakfast burrito, breakfast potatoes and cappuccino. Service was friendly and the food was so inexpensive yet great! 

The atmosphere was friendly and quiet. 

We will definitely be returning to try other things on the menu! 

I'm so happy to support a place that supports others! Way to go Bloom!"
__label__5	Out of coffee and OJ on a Sunday morning and STILL earned five stars, which shows how good the food was and how nice the waitress was.  Got the bagel & lox, which comes with standard onion, cream cheese, and capers, as well as avocado.  Ate some of my friend's fruit salad, which was high quality.  Tablecloth is butcher paper; crayons are available.  We had a blast.
__label__3	Homestyle chicken sandwich was good but service in the drive through was way too slow
__label__5	"Wow. I'm so glad I remembered I saw this place on Yelp because it was worth every penny. Really delicious and fresh sushi. Chef made me avocado balls with spicy crab and wow!! 
Service was awesome. 
BYOB next time and will be back soon!!!"
__label__4	The food was excellent. My husband and I each had 3 different street tacos. Every flavor was great! They had a bar with a variety of around 10 different self serve salsa's. The peanut salsa was interesting. I would recommend stopping by for a quick bite!
__label__5	"As good as insurance service as it gets.
Gail Pilgrim gave us stellar service with our auto policy.
So good we returned for our Life Insurance Policy too.
Excellent office.

Polite, helpful and appreciative of your membership.
This is the location you want to go to."
__label__4	I went here with my two kids, aged 8 and 13 and we played the games that were there.  My drink was good, the kids got soft drinks and the baked goods were scrumptious.
__label__4	Almost as expensive as planet beach. They always run a coupon in Clipper but it's only for $5 off... Which barely covers taxes. I was going here for a while when I moved back to Metairie. There's never a long wait and the hours are pretty standard. Staff always seemed nice and never annoying/pushy.
__label__3	I Came in for happy hour and was wonderful . Half price appetizers ,try the avocado rolls and the . Calimari
__label__5	I am a Latin 4 student at Blackman High School and every year my class takes a trip to the parthenon and then to the lovely Coco's. The staff is always attentive and the food is really good. They are always very kind to us as we usually stay for a few hours. I have never felt more welcome at a restaurant than I did at Coco's. My teacher thinks it's the best authentic Italian restaurant in Nashville
__label__4	Our daughter lives near this neighborhood restaurant. It was very casual and uniquely decorated with yard art and plants/flowers. We sat outside on picnic tables and enjoyed the music. The wait staff was very friendly. Service was a bit slow and it took a while to get our food, however it was tasty. They provided a vegan option for our daughter. I had the fish and chips which was good and my husband the blt. Food not a 5 star but the place was cute with good music.
__label__5	After sampling Texas BBQ in Amarillo and Kansas City BBQ you'da thunk St. Louis BBQ would be the obvious next chumbucket. But after hearing about St. Louis style pizza and toasted ravioli we had to adjust our priorities. I got several recommendations but ultimately settled on Cecil's. Whole family LOVED IT. Toasted ravioli didn't make it out of the little waiting area. Pizza was wolfed down in the car in about 5 minutes. Heh heh. Then the piggie party moved to Ted Drewe's!
__label__5	Great price and great taste. This hidden gem is filled with delicious baked treats and tasty warm breakfast and lunch dishes at an extremely reasonable price. They also have great coffee. This is a family friendly place. I would recommend this to anyone who likes good value meals and Hispanic food.
__label__1	The sign IN the restaurant says they offer breakfast sandwiches (croissant or panini) but the women working the shop had no idea what I was talking about and brought me ham and cheese on a sub roll. My husband ordered an everything bagel, they brought a plain one. Apparently they were out but didn't tell him this ever. The star is bc they were nice
__label__5	The only glass shop that was able to come out to my office and replace a broken door glass on the weekend. Some things simply can't wait till Monday and it was nice to have it done so quickly. Evidently, they guys do a great deal of emergency service. This is a family ran business on the third generation and they are really nice people to work with.
__label__3	"This is a nice big IKEA, pretty standard as far as Ikea's go.  I believe it is about the same size as the one in Conshohocken.  Plenty of cool furniture, and cool things to eat, both familiar and foreign. I'm still confused and perplexed by some of the names for things...""holmbo""?"
__label__5	This company is respectful, honest, and extremely helpful. I'm more confident that I made the right choice in choosing lock-it storage.
__label__4	"Saturday night we enjoyed dinner here at the Galleria after the concert at Powell Hall here in STL. 
Rack of ribs was very good and the garlic spinach, too.  Blue cheese coleslaw was average and the broccoli was average. 
Brisket was very good!! Ceasar salad was also very good. 
Service & ambiance very good. Free valet parking (some steaks looked pricey)"
__label__1	This place ids a f*cking NIGHTMARE!!!!!  You have to wait in multiple SUPER LONG lines. The staff doesn't know their head from their ass. NOT worth it!! So many better places to see.
__label__5	"This bar is eclectic, quirky, inclusive, and awesome all rolled into one. Their menu options have something for everyone of all dietary ranges to enjoy, and they also host small art shows that support local artists. SUPPORT LOCAL ARTISTS! 
 
Stop by grab a bite to eat (I have to come back to try the Pierogies!) and check out the upstairs bar with the walls covered in stickers and wheat pasta of your favorite philly artists-- Marisa V.R, Nero One, Sixteen Cats, Amberella, Hope Hummingbird, inphltrate, Angry Elephants, and many more!"
__label__4	Fast service on a busy Sunday morning. Decent omlette and delicious home fries.
__label__1	"Front office staff (Ladies at front desk) 
They are very rude & over the top almost as if we have principles that right our complex & they try to pin everything on residents they Typically don't like. Wouldn't want to live here again I would think twice if your considering it."
__label__3	Went here one time with a large crowd. The service was amazing and it seemed like even the smaller tables were even getting the same treatment. The food was great, no complaints. Would definitely come back again.
__label__1	"I am very disappointed with the new owners of In Soo Restaurant.  The food quality has deteriated compared to food that was once served in that restaurant.  The quality and qualitiy should never be served to patrons if you plan on them returning. When confronted about the poor quality the new owner claimed ""food not the same and will NOT give a refund"".  I will certainly NEVER eat there and I will make sure that all my friends hear about the poor quality of their food."
__label__5	"Great spot right on the water!! This place is awesome. Fast and friendly service with spectacular food. 

The peel and eat shrimp is so fresh and the shrimps are huge. The steak sandwich is also amazing with the horsey sauce. We had the best frozen drinks too."
__label__5	"Montecito Coffee Shop delivers quality food and service every time. 

Breakfast  is lovely and they have an excellent selection to truly enjoy.

Lunch during the week except Sunday is traditionally delicious, fresh and well prepared. 

No problem bring the pets they will receive excellent service with fresh water and a nice place to sit down when experiencing the front patio dining area. 

Always good food with friendly local staff that make you feel welcome.

Don't hesitate, meet family and friends, they will enjoy it too!"
__label__1	"Took two and a half hours to get the pizza. Called multiple times, was put on hold. Kept telling me it would be ready in ""30 minutes"" every time we called. Unbelievably bad service."
__label__5	our time there was very pleasant and our salesperson was very good we had a good rep port and we were happy with our purchase of a 2016 fusion.  The finance person was also very nice and easy to work with.  Thank you for a good experience .  Joe P.
__label__5	We are always happy with their yummy food. The owner is always nice and service also good. We come here whenever we need to fulfill our vietnemese cravings. The never disappoint.
__label__5	"Kona Beri is Fro Yo at it's best!  The fresh faced kids that run the place are very friendly and have lots of Aloha spirit.

The Fro Yo is some of the best I've had.  I absolutely love the Pineapple and Coconut swirled together.  Top it off with some Cap'n Crunch and I'm in heaven!

Mahlo Kona Beri, I wish you were in Alpharetta, GA too!"
__label__5	Fantastic Bread!!!!  Their strawberry and peach pie breads are to die for. I no longer buy my bread elsewhere. Since tasting their Russian Rye my daughter-in-law will now eat Rye.
__label__1	"This place is HORRIBLE! Never use Action Heating and Air! They came out and spent 10minutes in the home during summer, replaced our capacitor 425.00... two days later it is kaputz! Called them because they advertise 24/7 repair-basically told me to suck an egg they will be out in two days! The supervisor actually said "" Thank Obama"" for them not having capacitors and hung up. Un freaking believable! Stay far far far away from these people."
__label__5	Hands down one of my FAVORITE courses. I split my time between Dallas and Scott AFB and it was so great finding a Nicklaus design so close to home. Just about every hole is exciting and a few area thrill ride. The greens give you a taste of what's it's like for the guys in tour, and you need to place those approaches in the right spots to keep those strokes down. The club house is nice and the staff that I've encountered have all been very nice. I always look forward to a round here!
__label__4	Go here, you'll enjoy it. The wait staff is friendly and down to earth, the all-American food is delicious. The restaurant, plus farm, plus country store is pretty charming. I have had both breakfast and dinner here and was glad I did both. Basic breakfasts, as well as fancier breakfast skillets, were very satisfying. Fried chicken (a specialty) and veggies equally as good.
__label__2	First stop after arriving into LA. I should've waited and went to a more reputable place. Daiquiris didn't seem to have very much alcohol. The gal at the window handed us unwrapped straws from the bar. My straw was coated in dust and hair. When my husband asked for another straw, she seemed to have an attitude.
__label__5	Service was great food was great! The boozy iced coffee was quite tart but overall the experience was wonderful
__label__4	"It has the potential to be a diamond in the rough. The decor is fine- upscale sports bar - can be noisy even when not at capacity. Service is good. Food is interesting. Shrimp and grits were well prepared. My wife had chicken with tarragon- loved it.
Salads, especially the wedge got everyone's attention. Definitely go back to check it out again.

A good scotch or bourbon would have been a great complement, but alas, beer and wine only.

A little hard to find in a strip mall off of River Road and 146th - but definitely worth checking out."
__label__5	Best Chimichanga I've ever had! The place was clean and the waitress was very attentive on such a busy day.
__label__5	"The weirdest thing happened, I ate here and not even 9 months later I gave birth to a beautiful child! My family of 6 absolutely loves eating at Middle Child. Every time we come to Philadelphia we order the whole menu and feast like Kings. The staff is so friendly they make me forget I was a loser in high school, and college ! I recommend this spot to anyone who enjoys a well made and original sandwich. 

Favorites include but are not limited to:

So long Sal
Shopsin
Phogie 
Surfer
Reuben 
All breakfast sandwiches 
All specials
Coffee 
Tea
Chips"
__label__5	The most beautiful and unusual arrangements!   So striking and artistic!  A great choice!
__label__5	1864 is the Nevada version of cheers!! Coming from a man from Boston that means something! From the owner, Dylan, to the staff, everyone is friendly and knows your name. Nick is the bartender that will mix you up the best drink in Reno. The guy is a life saver behind the bar. Then there is Jess. . . She will make you a fantastic drink and is a such a sweetheart that you can't help but come back for more! Great night they kill it behind the bar. Love this place, and its staff.
__label__5	So delicious. Went for the first time and ordered two queso fun-Didos because it was that good! We loved all of our tacos too!  If you don't like spicy food, you may not like all of the options. I did feel most items were spicy, but I like spicy so - yay! We will be back!!
__label__3	Food is really good, but pricey. Be sure to sign in online before you go. Long waits. Understaffed as most places seem to be these days. Slow service. Not the place to go if you somewhere to be.
__label__5	Nothing beats half Cuban half 1905 salad to brighten a day. It really is the perfect lunch. I'd recommend it to anyone. I personally like the turkey addition to the salad, but the original ham, and shrimp are also delicious. And I might add that a glass of the red sangria is delicious to wash it down with.
__label__2	I would love to give Seed more than 2 stars, but the service was some of the worst I've ever had. The waiter was really inattentive, and gave our food to the wrong table every time he brought one of our items out. We also waited OVER AN HOUR for our food while people who had gotten there 45 minutes after we did got their food before us. The food was delicious, I will say but the service was just atrocious.
__label__3	This place was good when it first opened. But the last couple times it seems as tho the food is declining.  Definitely not as tasty. The service is always good tho.
__label__4	"We just moved to Spring Hill from Charlotte so we were looking for a new Pho place. Of you've been to Spring Hill you know there isn't anything close to Pho so we decided to drive up to Nashville. 

The Pho was good, great flavors. My husband really enjoyed his bahn mi. The Boba tea was not good at all."
__label__1	I was in the market for life insurance. The associate who helped me went above and beyond, my 1 star comes with their prices. I also received quotes from 2 other insurance companies and Country Financial was double the cost of the other two estimates. Mind you, it was for the same amount and term.. Pretty disappointed i couldn't give my business to the awesome sales associate.
__label__1	Extremely rude customer service! I was given clipped answers over the phone and a very rude attitude. I will not be shopping here.
__label__1	I wish I had been able to experience the service here. They confirmed through email that they could accommodate a same-day appointment, and then cancelled it within 20 mins of the appointment time while I was en-route. That is extremely poor customer service and I will not be back.
__label__1	Do not bother.  I went to have my spark plugs changes. They refused; they wanted to do a computer analysis to diagnose the problem.
__label__1	"Mandatory employee training on how to deal with negative feelings about changes. 

Security guard now patrols store.

Complete and utter failure of a business"
__label__3	My sister and I shared the wings and onion rings. The food was warm, not hot, and semi-flavorful. Service was a little slow, but our waitress was super nice. They could use a bug net or something outside (we moved inside shortly after being bit.) Wasn't super packed on a Thursday night.
__label__4	While we were a little disappointed that they were out of oysters for our visit, the friendly and prompt service, above average Bloody Mary and Fantastic Breaux Bridge Benedicts definitely made up for it. Definitely a great place for breakfast and brunch if you're in the Jackson Square area.
__label__5	Directly sourced, hand-roasted coffee. Great ambience overlooking the classic SB presidio. A great spot for a lazy Sunday morning.
__label__5	"YES. My personal favorite cheese steak in Philly. & that says a lot! 

I don't love cheesesteaks so I'll only eat them from Sonny's. There's seating, you don't feel like you're eating something dirty & they have everything you need. No complaints here - just everybody try it!!"
__label__3	Amazing French Dip and Mac and Cheese.  Good fries too.  Not a great selection of items and overpriced though.  If they added a few items and got their prices to a realistic level they could be four or five stars
__label__5	Really great find, small mom-and-pop restaurant that's just fresh homemade breakfast pancakes, hash browns, biscuits, jams. Definitely going to come back. Highly recommend
__label__4	The burger is very good. I was looking for a traditional burger and it tasted just right. The place was crowded and service was bad, but for a good traditional American burger, it is the real deal. I liked the way they did the lettuce. Lots of it and crunchy. The cheese and burger meld well right into your first bite.
__label__4	"Real happy I found this place on my trip to Tucson. This is a very authentic Jewish deli with great food and service! My group had the meatball sandwich, Philly cheese steak, etc... All of these were amazing! Highly recommend this place to all in town. Lastly, ""Lena"" was very sweet."
__label__5	"I was visiting from out of town for work and stopped in here with some friends for some appetizers and drinks. We shared various plates and I was blown away with how delicious the food was, especially the oysters, they were amazing. They just melted in your mouth. We also had some jumbo crab legs to go along and they were equally amazing. 

I'm sure the dinner entrees as fantastic here and I can't wait to come back to try out a full meal here."
__label__1	I chose Value Guard based on the reviews I found on-line and was extremely upset with the way my inspection went.  I was told the Radon Test would be started earlier in the week so I would have the results the same day as the inspection however the Radon test wasn't even started until the inspection.  Also, the termite inspector that was set up through Value Guard showed up 2.5 hours late on the day of the inspection.  I would not recommend them to a friend!
__label__2	"Great location is the only positive. 
Check in was very slow. Took them forever to find our reservation even though I showed them the confirmation on my phone. 
They told me they were fully booked but would honor our reservation (somehow.)
The check in took about 30 minutes. 
The room is not a deluxe king as reserved. It is a small sized room with a queen bed. 
The room needs to be thoroughly cleaned. The air vent was filthy. I showed the front desk a photo. I have posted before and after photos. 
I do not recommend this hotel."
__label__4	Pretty good food. A little heavy handed on the garlic though.  Nice people.  Ambiance is ok but nothing special.
__label__1	Don't even bother.  They say you get an online estimate in 10 minutes and received nothing.  Called the next day and the operator told me that someone would call in 10 minutes.  Now it's 24 hour later and still nothing.  Go with someone who wants to help you.
__label__4	I had the traditional gyro and DW had the chicken gyro. Both were delicious. Add the feta. Very pleased with food, the service and the facility.
__label__1	"Over two months ago we booked for a dinner with a party of 12-15 for a Tuesday night.  We arrived on time at 6:00PM.  We were not seated untill 7:00.  There were 40-50 CUSTOMERS WITH ONE WAITRESS waiting on everyone.  It took us 30 minutes for food to arrive and another
35 minutes to get our check.  It is almost like they do not want your business."
__label__1	"It's a good thing they don't make the candy. This business is closed in the winter. If you call they want you to enter a code, for what I don't know. They should at least tell patrons they are closed instead of having to drive to speedway to read a note on the door. Terrible survice. They don't care about 
you!!! The paying consumer."
__label__1	Rating is not for the food as that is good. Ordered delivery through Ubereats. Only received half of the order. When I called Archie's they gave me the option of picking it up..really? Why did I just have it delivered if I could pick it up.
__label__5	This place is amazing!! It's mostly just take out - there are a couple of small tables but it seems like they're for people waiting for their order. The food is fantastic and everyone is so nice. I'll definitely be back regularly!
__label__1	Ordered the moo goo gai pan.  Tasted like there was slime on the chicken and there was gooey sticky stuff.  Took one bite and threw it out.  Never again.
__label__5	Great little restaurant for tasty Vietnamese food at a great price. Run by a nice little Vietnamese family. Perfect for a nice simple dinner. Definitely coming back.
__label__2	"Two stars because the boat didn't sink. Service was poor to spotty. Dinner was acceptable. Trying to get a cup of coffee was sort of an ordeal. The dessert was served only to the people seated who did not go outside to see the bottom of broadway. They never came back to serve the dessert. We asked 3 times before we got one for my wife. 
I suppose I would recommend not doing the dinner for $90."
__label__5	This was amazing! Definitely worth it. So much lobster in it. And the sarachi was perfect amount of spice but not spicy. Bacon topped it off. Even my 12 year old scarfed it down.
__label__3	The staff here is very nice and accommodating, but I've had trouble multiple times with to go orders - so be sure to double check your food.  One time they gave me the wrong person's meal, and the following time they forgot to give me chips when I paid for chips and guac  a real disappointment when you're starving and drive home 20 minutes to find out you didn't get what you paid for.
__label__4	"Love coming here on Tuesday nights for Team trivia with my daughters.  Steve puts on a great show! 

Uke's has a decent selection of local beers on draft (Big Storm, Florida Ave) and other craft beers as well as a full bar.

The chicken finger basket is great-large strips of boneless chicken, battered and fried.  Good burgers, lots of people love the fish chowder, dinners are good.

Weekend entertainment is fun-usually local bands performing.  It can get very crowded and hard to get a drink or a space to stand."
__label__1	Place is cool but the staff just absolutely kill the place and vibe. They offered the table next to me perks and to me nothing (maybe because they were white i don't know) but I realized they had attitude towards me and my spouse but were being outgoing with other customers. I will not be coming again do to my experience being here. I absolutely do not recommend this place at all towards anyone!!!!
__label__5	"I had the pleasure of meeting Salem, the owner.  He is a true American story, he came here from Tunisia, started out washing dishes, and attained the American dream through hard work and perseverance!  

Through talking to him, I found him to be interested in my opinion, and customer oriented.

Also, he loves food.  This is what food should be about.

I felt like he genuinely cared.  Two thumbs up!!"
__label__4	awesome place! food tastes great and the service was great too, even though they were packed. get the dragon roll! will definitely be coming back frequently.
__label__4	I had the New Orleans ice coffee (meaning it has chicory in it) and it was very good. The man behind the counter didn't seem well informed about much though.
__label__2	My wife and I live close by and went over to get some dessert to go. The cake and cookies were very good. The service is the reason for two stars. The woman behind counter last night was purposely slow when there was no one in the store. What should have taken 2 minutes took over 10 for no apparent reason. It was a very odd situation and we will not be going back.
__label__5	My first experience with this office was excellent. Dr. Perschon and the office staff were so kind and caring. So happy to have found such an excellent organization
__label__1	Worst service on the beach -totally ignored for 30 minutes -wait staff outnumbered customers and we had to call the restaurant number to finally get a waiter/ 45 minutes to get served -beautiful setting -obviously bad management
__label__1	"AWFUL !! their burgers are obviously microwaved, they're flakey and they fall apart VERY easily. 
They have no flavor at all, it tastes like you're eating wet cardboard with cheese and some lettuce chucked on top. absolutely repulsive, will not be eating here ever again."
__label__4	"Nom nom nom nom!

We had their soup and panini special for lunch one day, and it was out of this world. I don't know what loving magic they infused it with, but we both found ourselves scrounging around for crumbs, not wanting to miss one little bit of it.

Oddly, we didn't try their banner dessert product ... but we'll be back for more."
__label__5	Fantastic cocktails and great bartenders. It's usually quiet and and is a great low key alternative. The tour is interesting with a nice tasting afterwards. Say hey to Copper for me.
__label__4	"I love this place. Granted, the service sucks really bad, but it you want cheap tasty food, here ya go. I noticed people who have given this place a bad review mentioned they have lived in Texas. Well, I was born and raised in Texas darlin so that don't mean Jack to whether this is good food or not. 

I come here for the cheese dip. Period. The salsa is also very tasty. The chips get it done. The chicken burrito with the cheese sauce is awesome. It's worth the money."
__label__2	The guy behind the counter was a little gruff and not terribly interested in taking our order, and the kitchen was very slow (we were the only people in there and sat for about 20 min waiting for chicken fingers & a cold sub). There were only 3 tiny chicken fingers & a giant pile of french fries, so that was kind of crappy, however the Italian sub was awesome. I'd get it again if I call ahead, but that's about it.
__label__1	Looooooong wait...food was whatever. I will not be coming back. No flavor, worst Mexican restaurant I ever been to.
__label__3	TO HOT!!  I'm not a Spicey eating person so his was not my favorite place for food. I will say they did everything right. Offered me another meal, and comped my meal and gave us a 25.00 gift card to return to try something else. Drinks are high in price and I think they should have a lunch happy hour everyone was nice. Place was clean service was spot on. If you like spicey foo I'd say give it a  try it
__label__5	I stumbled unto this wine bar by chance, and what a lovely surprise! The tapas menu is out of this world! Well curated wines for every taste. A transportation experience right here in Tampa. Well worth the visit. I will definitely return.
__label__4	Comfort food for the soul. The sandwiches taste great and the sauces add heat and taste. Delicious. The bread seems to be made here and the toppings aren't top notch but it is better than what I could whip up at home.
__label__1	Trash. Employees are beyond rude, useless and full of themselves. You like going to a place where they think their cr@p don't stink then this is the place for you. Smug and worthless. Oh boy, can't wait to go back - never.
__label__4	Solid Indian cuisine right by the Franklin Institute with friendly service and halal meat, including beef curries. Daal makhani, saag paneer, and butter chicken are all very creamy and lamb vindaloo is nice and spicy. Dinner service in the restaurant is congenial, with expertly folded napkins and dishes served in silver pots, though the restaurant seems to do equal parts dine-in and delivery. The bar tends to be lined with food packed up to go. BYOB.
__label__1	Booked two different ultrasounds for one appointment. Everything was fine and comfirmed, seemingly. Upon arrival only one of the appointments was in the system and they couldn't squeeze me in for the abdomen ultrasound and redirected me across the city for an appointment two hours later. I was already nauseous from the fasting I had to do in preparation for the ultrasound and had to wait another 2 hours with no food or water.
__label__5	Wonderful place. Atmosphere relaxing and Linda did a super great job and fast. First time here and definitely will be back.
__label__5	Fantastic place to eat! My wife and I did everything except lick our plates. Not only was the food good the staff was great!! Try the carrot cake.
__label__5	I've only been inside of the building a few times, but have always had pleasant customer service. This spot is convenient for me because it's right on the way to where I'm going everyday. I've never had any problems with any of the ATMs they have.
__label__5	"I love going to Steve's. I have gone solo, and with a friend.  She loves it because she feels that she can be herself, and never felt pressured, or intimidated. I love it because I have never failed to meet a like minded person to ""get to know"" much better.   The rooms and common areas are always clean.   There are all shapes and sizes here."
__label__4	"Came here last night for an outdoor concert. The band was really good and the outside location was perfect. The wine was quite good for a local vineyard and I purchased a bottle to take home.
The barn was quite impressive.
Plan to return at a future date.
Ample parking and not that far of a drive from Wilmington, Delaware."
__label__2	"The beers to go are expensive!  They aren't marked so when you check out your 6 pack, you are playing roulette on whether a 6 pack is $18 or $25.  Even the low range is higher then other great places in the area.

Great selection and their bar is fun, but I don't recommend this place."
__label__5	"Great Place, Great owners, and terrific food.  Loved it :-)
This place mixes and matches some styles of cooking that are unheard of-not exotic...but taste taste.   A must try !"
__label__5	I mean it's amazing and high tech for these little ones.  I have a 2 and 5 yo and they both  this place.  It's inexpensive, clean and well staffed.  So glad this is part of our community
__label__2	Well, that was a little disappointing. The space is very nice. Unfortunately,  the food and service leave plenty to be desired.  Service was pretty slow. My $9.00 martini, when it finally came, arrived in highball glass. The food was fine-not great or in any way memorable, but fine. I'm really just left with no reason to visit again.
__label__1	"Per customer service......it was suggested that I go on the roof of my home, remove the snow and this should fix my television service failure.  The next IDIOT suggested that I should get a water hose and clean the dish receiver (Present temperature 28 degrees)

The final blow was the one that suggested that to get optimum service I should purchase a covering to protect my satellite dish......


My suggestion for you is to close your doors and possibly get a GED."
__label__1	Everyone expects to be ripped off by the towing company when their car gets towed, but Thomas Towing takes this criminality to another level. $95 per day storage fee, $135 gate fee to pick up your car on a weekend (i.e. when most people are able to), only willing to release the car if the owner is physically present or faxes them. Car was towed on a Monday; received no notification from the towing company. Went to pick it up on Saturday and had to pay a ransom of $1000. Hopefully someone in local government in charge of contracting with them notices this abuse.
__label__5	I just purchased a preowned Highlander from Team Toyota.  It was a great experience, although time consuming.  I was not pressured, they worked hard to get me the deal I wanted, they were patient, professional and kind.  I worked with salesman Stan Esposito and he was terrific, as was the rest of the team: Barry, Billy and Lou.  I recommend this dealership without reservation.
__label__3	Woodlands is good if you are actually vegetarian, the buffet is all right and there are some Manchuria treats that taste about like meat but is not actually. The veggie stuff is very tender and juicy and I like the mix of Manchuria and Indian influences
__label__1	"Pésimo servicio. La mesera no nos atendía para nada y la comida no era de muy buena calidad. La comida duró mucho para llegar. Pueden encontrar mejor comida en cualquier otro lugar. No lo recomiendo para nada. 

Horrible service. The waitress did not attend to us and the food was of very poor quality. It also took a very long time to arrive. You can find better quality food at any other place. I do not recommend this place at all."
__label__5	"This place was recommended to us and we were not disappointed.   We used the app to be added to the wait list and then only had a 10 minute once we arrived.  We ordered the ziti and a pizza.  Both were outstanding.  The ziti was especially great.  
The only downside here was lack of parking due to it being so popular."
__label__5	Food was excellent! At first we were doubtful with the limited reviews but we did not regret our choice. We got the cannelloni, pollo parmigiana, and lobster ravioli. All three are great and have their own unique flavor.
__label__5	Very good service and better food! Startwd with the caprese bites. The tomato qas fresh and the cheese with the dressing mixed extremly well that made me want more. Burger i ordered was the jumpback jack and it was perfection on as bun and the fries were great with the seasoning. I will be back next time I am back in town. Deffinantly FBA [fat boy approved]
__label__3	This was a great zoo, however there were few places were under construction when we visited. I felt like I got ripped off for paying the full price for the admission. The zoo felt more like a state park with animals here and there. Animals were very dispersed and not a lot of variety. We had to walk quite bit distance between different animals. Liked the cleanliness. Also the concession stands were very limited and pricey. The zoo could be better once the construction were over. For now I felt like I wasted fifty dollars on the admission fee.
__label__3	"Rented tables, chairs, and tablecloths from them for my wedding.

Pros - cheaper than other local companies, most of the rentals were totally adequate

Cons - they do absolutely no set up, one table was wobbly, charged us for a few allegedly damaged tablecloths

I would use them again if on budget. You get what you pay for!"
__label__5	By far the best soul food that your mama didn't make. Catfish is my personal favorite.  The gumbo is great. The ribs are a must. Don't forget the dessert options. There is no other restaurant in the Reno area that gives you more home style soul food options. Oops! Did I mention the lemonade?  Enjoy! I always do!
__label__3	I was greeted rather quickly. I appreciate that. The item I wanted they had in stock. That was awesome. They got it and brought it to the register. The part that frustrated me was that the item I purchased was a 28lb bag of kitty litter and they can be a bit awkward. I also had had my cane with me. I was offered no assistance to my vehicle with the bag nor was I offered a cart. That was disappointing. Otherwise the trip and the item was there and all was good.
__label__5	This place literally has hundreds of beers to choose from! You can mix your sixpacks, fill growlers, and the staff and even the other people there don't make you feel stupid if you're not a craft beer expert. It's such a friendly place.
__label__5	Slate detail did an amazing job on my car! Brandon doesn't miss a crack when it comes to detail. My leather seats and my carpets are like brand new again. Excellent job! Thank you so much.
__label__4	"The beignets were just as good as Cafe du Monde.  The difference is that they are bigger, thicker, and dusted with more powdered sugar than Cafe du Monde. I like the fact that they can customize your coffee here.  I ordered the cafe au lait but asked for half and half instead of whole milk.  I'm not sure if that still makes it a cafe au lait but it tasted real good with my sweet beignets.  

The cafe is small and charming and have some outdoor seating where you can people watch and enjoy your treat."
__label__5	We used sweet Lucy's to cater my sisters bridal shower, they were very easy to work with, prices were great, food was out of this world and plentiful. They delivered the food on time and did a great job setting it up. I'm going to be eating the chopped brisket leftovers for breakfast lunch and dinner until they are finished. I highly recommend using them for your next party.
__label__2	I was looking forward to trying a new tap house/ pub and when I got there i found a smelly, overpriced, dive bar with  mediocre appetizers at best. The service was rushed even though hardly anyone was in the place! We ended up having apps and a beer and leaving. We actually went elsewhere for dinner.
__label__5	This is my absolute favorite italian place around! I've been coming here for years and have never been disappointed. Be prepared to wait for a table if you come on the weekend, but it's worth the wait and so is the tight fit inside!
__label__3	"Omlette special price $9.75 menu price for same 9.75... not much of a special.
Half order biscuits and gravy 4.95 for 1 very large biscuit. 
The sausage is very salty.. the gravy very gummy. The hash potatos your average restaurant browns cooked nice a crisp.
The husband and I wanted to split the omlette and they were very accommodating. Our waitress best in the world..."
__label__3	"Alls well and good til you have a service issue. You'll be given the infamous 'cant duplicate the problem' and they'll hide  behind voice maiL and numerous messages must  be left in order to get a return call. Even then there will be no resolution to your issue. I bought the first Passport sold in Reno- biggest mistake I ever made!

Update: Rich contacted my husband, and they were able to handle our service issue and get our car returned to us in a timely manner. We are quite happy with how things worked out. The communication was greatly improved"
__label__1	If I could give them zero stars I would. The staff was incredibly rude. I've come into the store on multiple occasions and am constantly treated the same offensive way. I came in there today with a couple friends and was asked for I'd which is not a problem at all. Me and my friends were all 21 however, we were discriminated based on my appearance and products I was buying. We will not be back!
__label__3	Stopped here for some brews on a Saturday night.  I would say that service was average.  Bartender took way too long to serve us.  The food was mediocre and did not have anything exciting.  Parking was pretty easy since its in a strip mall. They did not have enough tvs for everyone to enjoy different games.  I just left there with no want to return.  Bar is in the corner of dale mabry and Van dye road.
__label__5	Still gets 5 stars but dont forget that it's a cash only place!
__label__4	this is where the locals go.. plus you can do laundry while you drink and listen to live music.  Lots of fun!
__label__2	It's another Americanized Chinese food restaurant. The ingredients seem fresh enough, but the taste is not authentic at all.
__label__1	"Bar tender tried twice to make a gin & tonic & failed.   Who uses club soda for a G& T? We finally said forget it.  
Worst meal in decades.   The nachos were bland, plain, & generic.  Ordered a filet; it was tasteless.   Plating was not appealing.  Very disappointing.  
Staff was very friendly.  Really liked them.  They were the only good thing about our 30 minute drive to eat there.  Wasted $96."
__label__3	Pretty average place.  Food was ok; service was good at first but dropped off as the night went on. Saturday night 8pm and very few patrons. Kind of a weird mix of industrial decor with black lights around the bar. The only thing that will keep this place alive is Season.  Locals are not coming here so won't sustain. Not a bad place just not really better than others close by.
__label__4	Excellent Mexican food!!.. The guacamole is really good!.. And all the entrees are delicious!. The portions are pretty big!!... Also, the cocktails are great!!... The outdoor area is very nice!.. I think this is one of the best options for Mexican food in Tampa!,
__label__5	This place is a gem.  The cocktails are delicious and WHAT a great whisky selection!   We ordered almost all of the apps and enjoyed them, especially the poutine and bruschetta.
__label__5	It was a long line waiting to get in, but soooo worth it! The chicken was amazing! I took my family and they loved it! I'd wait in the line any day to get some more! Great customer service as well!
__label__4	Ah best memories coming here during teenager years before Christmas day and landing on my arse like Bambi!  Make sure you wear lots of clothes and if need be butt cushion so you don't end up like me! ;-P New Year's Eve by Penn's Landing waterfront I hear can be most exciting to skate here but prices go up. Outdoor skating is a lot of fun- hope you have a blast!
__label__4	We were sat after a short wait at the end of the breakfast rush. We were attended to quickly. The server was friendly. We waited a long time on the kitchen. Our server explained the wait and offered us refills and a cinnamon roll. Well done! Excellent customer service! The food was all excellent and delicious. The silverware and dishes were all high quality. A great dining experience.
__label__5	This is a must do event. If you are planning a trip, it is a good idea to plan it for this event. every year major stars of blues, jazz, and rock will be appearing. The food vendors absolutely rule, maybe they should call it the food and jazz festival? Plenty of room to stretch out, a good beach blanket or quilt comes in handy. A very good time and the folks you meet here are fun also.
__label__1	Typical airport fare. I was lucky enough to go on 9 dollar beer day. It was packed inside and didn't have a very expansive food menu. The bartender was slow and forgetful. But, what else can you do? You're held hostage at airport prices
__label__4	Definitely a calm port in the storm that is Bourbon Street.  A must see when in the area since it is touted as the oldest bar in the US.  There is bar and table seating inside, as well as a couple table outside too.
__label__5	Maria is an extraordinary seamstress.  Her work is always well done and she is very pleasant to do business with.  There doesn't seem to be a project that she can't tackle - I've given her a few challenges and she always comes through!
__label__5	These cookies are to die for. They're not too sweet- they're just perfect! I also love that they feature a cookie of the month in which you can try different creations. Their delivery system is nice too. You are notified when the driver is at your house. Chip has not disappointed.
__label__3	I hate to say this, but their pizza/food has gone way down hill. It hurts, because they used to be best in town. Idk if they've gotten a new cook, or have just gotten sloppy, but depending on the night, its either way undercooked and mutilated by the time it gets to us, or way over cooked and cold. Either way, its gotten flat and tasteless, & salad is watery, and I've given it multiple tries and every time it lets me down. So bummed, but I think I'm done.
__label__4	We went for dinner on a Friday night, and enjoyed the food and wide selection of drafts.  It is VERY loud.  My husband had the chicken, and is still raving about it.  Only complaint is that while we were waiting at the bar, the bartenders were extremely inattentive and we had to wait 10 minutes to order a drink. Otherwise, great.
__label__1	Terrible customer service in the service dept.  I had to have my car jump started to get there,  my battery was dead.  I was told when I got there they couldnt do it they close in an hour.  Thank goodness Stoops in Plainfield saw it differently and worked me right in.
__label__5	Great practice no high pressure to come every day like most chiropractors felt better after the first time and kept feeling better each time I went
__label__4	I'm glad to have a local Indian restaurant. My only issue with this place is the quality of the chicken. I can tell it's not good by the consistency. It's not soft and moist, but rather strangely rubbery. I think they should do something about that. Overall, the flavor of the food is very good. Great samosas too.
__label__5	If your not stuffed from the food next door, or even if you are, this place is an amazing stop for frozen slushii goodness! Mind you this is an adult only establishment, 21 and up.
__label__5	We had a great time! Y'all have something special, it was hilarious and fun! I would recommend this to anyone who's coming to Nashville. Definitely worth the money! Thank you!
__label__5	My husband or I takeout a pizza once a week. The ingredients are fresh and the checf owner is a very nice person. thick or thin crust you cannot go wrong.
__label__5	We appreciate the variety and have purchased some fine pieces at Tom's. Yes, you have to wander around a bit, but that's half the fun!
__label__1	Like everyone else say's The Boot is basically a Tulane bar on the edge of campus. Although it holds fond memories to anyone who ever went to Tulane or threw up in the bathroom you probably need heed the warnings and steer clear of this place.
__label__4	Very good, their Bb wings are so crispy and crunchy. There's a little spice in there so be careful. I also like their spicy crispy chicken over rice bowl. I haven't had their poke bowls so I can't help you there. The only problem i have is, the food takes forever! But will def keep coming back for their wings.
__label__4	I ordered delivery from Indian Restaurant tonight. Chicken Tikka, Samosas, and Naan. I was pleasantly surprised. If you're not looking to go out to dinner or are looking for an easy BYO, Indian Restaurant is a good choice.
__label__4	Very good food and very good beer selection but the seating is horrible.  The waitstaff tends to have a small bit of attitude sometimes but overall it's a nice place to go
__label__2	"The laundromat is bright, clean, safe, comfortable, conveniently located with great hours, air conditioning and free WiFi. The machines are most always operational and parking is free in a well lit/safe lot.  

I really like this place and it deserves 4 Stars, but I am uncomfortable with the inappropriate behavior of one staff member (thus the 2 Stars) who is loud, highly opinionated, spews negativity, and gossips about customers.  This person makes for a very unpleasant visit."
__label__5	Great date night! Amazing pizza! Service was on point! Thank you! I will definitely be back.
__label__4	"Different style of pizza.  Like the chewy New York dough type feel to the pizza.  Can eat a whole large by myself but I have to share.  

No real place to sit down at eat, designed more for carryout.  

Recommend you try it at least once, most likely you'll be back for more."
__label__5	Favorite Thai resturant in Tampa. The shrimp pad se ew is amazing
__label__5	Waited for about 20 minutes for a Monday morning brunch table. Small place, friendly staff. Ordered the French Toast Monte Cristo and it was a delicious combination of sweet and salty. The home fries are also great with some Crystal hot sauce. Coffee is also really good. Highly recommend this place.
__label__5	Sevan is a great place!  I always feel welcomed and well cared-for.  The front desk staff greets me by name, the scalp massage is to die for, and I always love my cut/color.  They really take the time to make sure you love your hair, and that it's done properly--and they're not afraid of new and exciting styles and techniques.  I'm a very satisfied customer!
__label__5	IF YOURE HERE , make sure chris is behind the bar , he's the best. 10/10 experience !
__label__3	The food was good! Unfortunately don't know if I'll be back . The owner was very unprofessional. He was correcting his employees in front of the customers. As someone who's worked hospitality for quite some time. I've been in that situation . It doesn't end well. Service and food are a package deal. Cannot enjoy your food if you know the employees making it are not being treated right .
__label__5	"I saw The Wiz and this show was spectacular! Set design, costumes, cast, choreography were all top notch! I love how with over 100 years of shows this outdoor Greek style theater can have such a wonderful showcase with incredible talent in such a beautiful setting! 
I can't wait to see the next show in the series this year and be amazed again! Keep up all the good work and keep the arts going strong in St. Louis!"
__label__4	great food, wonderful staff, and decent prices.  the babba is great, the lentils are delicious!  lunch specials, too.  would recommend highly to anyone looking for solid Mediterranean/Lebanese food.
__label__5	This is the best steak in New Orleans, I absolutely adored everything about this restaurant. Highly recommended.
__label__5	Food and service was great! Our waitress, Jasmine, was great and we loved everything we ordered. Definitely worth stopping in.
__label__5	I Was here for my friends birthday on 10/22/16. It was so much fun. I really enjoyed painting and drinking with my friends. Eli is a great artist and an even better host. Easy on the eyes too. Everyone had a blast. Can't wait to come back!
__label__3	"Spacious atmosphere! Happy hour is half off appetizers, so that's what we ordered. Best appetizers were the mild wings and chicken quesadillas. Very typical bar-type food, nothing really special!

Didn't order any entrees so don't have anything to say about the main menu, but based off of appetizers and beer selection, it's just above average. Would I come here again? Probably not my top pick, but I would come to try a main dish to give it another chance."
__label__4	Food was hot, fresh and prepared to order. Everything was tasty  but a little under seasoned for my taste. Onion rings and okra were frozen. I miss that hand battered onion ring taste. Red beans and okra were decent. I'll be back for the chicken for sure not so much the sides that I chose this time.
__label__4	great mushroom dish, fabulous spiced olive oil to dip bread into, and really enjoyed the carrot dish.
__label__5	I think this place has changed hands recently because it is way different in there - much more organized and attractive with some great things. I bought a very cool yellow damask wing chair for a great price.  The English lady, Jane, who works there is super friendly and helpful.  I'll definitely be going back regularly for a little treasure hunting.
__label__5	I had a great time and I like the service bcz he was soo understanding waiter and food was gud too. This was my first visit and I like it over all.
__label__4	Had a decent and tasty lunch.  The carnitas were fresh for lunch .  This is often  a fail for many Mexican restaurants.
__label__4	Had the shrimp and grits, good stuff, great open patio, inside is a bit crowded. Reservation is something I would suggest.
__label__3	Food was okay, but way overpriced for the portions and quality. I wouldn't bother eating here again.
__label__5	Came here for lunch and got a salad. I got fried chicken instead of the grilled chicken that came with it. The serving size was very generous, especially for lunch. Service was good and I enjoyed my time here. Check them out!
__label__1	"Firstly, the service was extremely delayed. After waiting for almost an hour after ordering the food, they served it incorrectly and with missing ingredients we specifically requested for.

The place was fancy but the service and food was bad. It probably was a one time mess up but for the price we paid for the food, we expected a better service. 

P.S: This review was supposed to be posted in December 2014. Somehow missed it."
__label__5	Been eating my beloved Chipotle for twenty years and the two times I've ordered at this location have literally been two of the BEST burritos ever! Perfect portions and timely delivery. Keep up the good work.
__label__5	Great, great retro/second hand clothing store. A little pricey, but it is a real treasure trove.
__label__5	This review is for catering (although I'm a loyal sit down and take away customer as well) today I had ~$400 of catering delivered. The quality of the food was outstanding and the value incredible. They went out of their way to deliver even during off hours they weren't normally open. They thought of everything (plates, utensils, serving tongs, even a table cloth!) all free of charge. I can't recommend Baby Blues for catering highly enough.
__label__5	"These guys are great, do a great job and are reasonably priced.
Communication has been excellent!  Would recommend.

They don't tend to respond super quickly to project requests but likely due to the fact that they are too busy?  And they did responded fairly timely, to a couple of project assessment / requests.  Good guys."
__label__5	Mike Shannon's Grill at Lambert St. Louis Airport started off their invite service today. The atmosphere of the place is new, friendly, and everyone left happier than when they arrived. Must try items include: the dry rub wings, loaded BBQ pork nachos, and the seasonal cheesecake!
__label__2	"As usual, this location was out of certain items. I ended up getting broccoli beef instead of my usual string bean chicken. This little piece of beef was all in the broccoli beef. I had to ask myself ""Where's the Beef?"" 
Good food but not so good on mixture of both meat and veggie."
__label__5	New favorite! Had early dinner, food is super delicious! Service was excellent! Can not wait to go back!
__label__1	"Giga monster is terrible very slow speeds and it crashes often.  You have no choice since they will not allow any other internet or TV providers into the facility. I heard Wildcreek and giga monster have the same owners too.

The staff has been great and very helpful. Overall I like the place just the internet is really bad."
__label__5	This place is delicious, so much care into the food! Gorgonzola gnocchi is out of this world amazing and I just finished it and want another bowl. We got two pizzas they are smaller so I'd suggest two for two ppl with a salad or a side and it's more than enough food for a big ole Friday dinner. Owners are lovely and their pizza is way better than five points pizza down the street!
__label__4	"Cozy spot, super friendly staff, good coffee! Even gave me a discount for using my own cup :)
Bagel & cream cheese was not anything exciting, it was ""greek cream cheese"", kind of a different taste. But then they are not going for the breakfast thing, more like a dessert bakery. Perfect spot for a quick coffee or dessert!"
__label__5	Baja cafe is awesome! We are here for couple days from Dallas ... This place rocks! Yosemite bloody Mary is superb as is the cinnamon roll pancake. Atmosphere is fun. You will not be disappointed.
__label__4	Not perfect and they don't handle busy times very well. However they are the best car wash in town. Blows Mikes Car Wash away.
__label__5	I absolutely love this specific Culver's. Delicious burgers and shakes. Always get the cheese sauce for your fries. I'm definitely a repeat customer.
__label__5	"This place is awesome. I've been here a couple times to check out products and do a lip and chin wax, and the staff is awesome. They pretty much pamper you right when you walk in. Granted they do it so that they can sell you products, but it's still great customer service nonetheless. As for the facial hair waxing, they did it to me sitting up which felt kind of weird, but I was happy with the results anyway! Another bonus is they provide cover up after you wax so you don't look awkward after.
BOTTOM LINE, they're awesome."
__label__5	I use this store all the time for packages, fax, notary and printing. They are always great and helpful and honest about their limitations and sometimes recommend other possible alternatives. I am so grateful to have them so close and local.
__label__1	"I won't be coming back. The green curry was very sub par and they had surprisingly small portions for what was charged. The service was very slow.
Someone in our group ordered green curry but with tofu instead of chicken, which I had ordered. His dish came out as a thin brown ish broth, clearly missing the coconut milk. When he pointed it out to the waiter, he said that it was green curry and that mine was actually green because the chicken makes the color change. The stones on this guy...
There are MUCH better Thai restaurants in Reno."
__label__1	Terrible food bland sauce and overpriced. There are plenty of other places to get great food.
__label__2	Front desk lady  in the morning is very nice as helpful. Housekeeping is loud in the mornings and wouldn't change my sheets. The sheets had stains on them when I came in and had visible dirt on them. The place made my eyes burn for the first few hours because the chlorine was so heavy. Pretty old property but not awful for the price. The breakfast is apples and some buns not a real breakfast.
__label__5	We were actually able to go in to eat. Ordered their French onion soup, and a mixed drink. The soup was delicious,  and the service was grear
__label__5	We're so happy with the service.  Andrew the cashier & server, suggested options where we can save instead of buying it separate order.  He's very attentive & hardworking.  We're so please with food, hot plate for hot food & cold plate for the salad, it's just awesome.
__label__5	At the biscoff which was incredible, I recommend it highly. English toffee was good as well. The ice cream seems very fresh and tasty, a great way to cool down after spicy Thai food. Will be back for sure and they have locations in La which is a plus.
__label__1	The customer service is poor. My cashier face was frowned up. She did not even say thank you come again. This is the second time this week I've been here and everyone just miserable. Hopefully, they can get some training in better customer service.
__label__5	"Fantastic food! Every visit we discover something new. This time it was the garlic naan. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. 

Environment is great, the servers are friendly, and the prices are very reasonable. The best Indian food I've had in the city!"
__label__1	I just went in to have a screw put in glasses that were purchased from a store that is no longer in business. They replaced it and charged me $5 never said there was a charge! No other store has ever charged me!  I buy glasses all the time! Certainly won't buy anything here!  Suggest you ask before doing anything. Terrible customer service policy.  At least tell the customer there is a charge!
__label__5	Do not go here if you are avoiding bread or on a  diet, it would be pure torture.  One of the few places in town you can get a proper pate sandwich and a croissant. Heaven on earth and pretty authentic french food. You can not go wrong with anything on the menu , and they have a nice selection of french gifts and food for you to take home. My only complaint is that parking can be a little tricky.
__label__3	So disappointed, looked forward to some tortilla soup after a long day in the rain and wind. I know they don't close till 10pm. I called and asked why their light was off but if they would sell me some soup and I'd be on my way but they notified me they were so slow they shut their doors at 9pm. It's sad that the business closes earlier dude to being Slow. Guess I'll find a new spot that will stick to their posted hours. Great food but I need to know I can count on you guys.
__label__3	Recently remodeled and drive-thru is still a cluster.  It doesn't help that some jerks enter the wrong way. Food is great though, of course.
__label__4	This is hands down the best Chinese food I've had in Philadelphia. It's also a BYO! Their menu has a lot of choices and most dishes come with either a side of rice or noodles. I recommend getting noodles if you're looking to have leftovers the next day as they give you plenty. I also recommend starting with the pork soup dumplings!! It is cash only so bring cash or be subject to the ATM fines in store.
__label__2	The last time I went I wanted to order a boneless ice cream but instead they gave me bone in and when I asked for some soda they gave me clown juice honestly very disappointed with how they managed my order
__label__2	I have had varied experiences with Fairmount Bicycles over the years. I find purchasing from them is a completely different and positive experience, where I have had several rude encounters with repairs. Last time I went they said a repair would not be possible and were short, rude, and curt about it. When I took it to another shop they fixed it no problem (at a lower price). After the last visit I will not be returning again.
__label__5	This place is the most authentic Mexican food you can find in Nashville. I know this for a fact because the owner also owns Cotijas in Santee, CA, which is city very near the border of Mexico where the real Mexican food is from. It is not Tex-mex, its that real true Mexican food that you can only find in San Diego and Mexico.
__label__5	No need to go to Taco Bus for us anymore this place ROCKS! Always fresh and unique, LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. Take our out of town guests here now and they all love the variety and the staff always seems happy!
__label__5	"The energy felt in this space mirrors perfectly with the positivity and welcoming smiles of its staff. It is clear Bobby Mack and Co have gone above and beyond to build a business that centers around the client- providing an open space for creativity while focusing on the details. The mission of this salon is to exceed expectations, which they execute almost effortlessly.

Bobby has worked diligently on my hair for years now, and I wouldn't dream of going anywhere else."
__label__4	Overall a great experience. Stayed in the corner breezy room--great view--but the windows were always dogged up (see pics below). Not complaining because they upgraded me to this room when they didn't have the breezy room available! The hotel was walking distance to many places which made it really convenient. Cannot comment on the parking expenses because I used Uber. Let me have a late check out, and the lobby had pool/other games to keep me occupied until my flight. Would stay here again!
__label__5	We've come here almost every weekend since Stellas opened, because we love to sit outside at this quaint little spot with our dogs and because it's consistently great food,  but today, they knocked it out of the park with the lobster burrito!   10 stars.
__label__3	Super hip coffee shop in a very hip part of town. Our hotel recommended it as a kid-friendly breakfast nook, but not so sure about that. Yes, there were high-chairs, but I definitely received some annoyed looks from the baristas and clientele for bringing in my three crumb-snatchers.  Also, just about the only breakfast food I found for the kids was a berry muffin, which was less sweet than the kids (and I) anticipated, like a scone. Ah, well. Coffee was superb, tho!
__label__1	"Didn't even get a chance to go to this place because the receptionist was soooooo rude! All he cared about was getting my money and telling me not to be late, before I could even ask any questions he kept saying ""what are your card numbers for payment?' This says alot about a business! Go to Infinity Health and Wellness Center, sooooo much better!"
__label__5	"Had a great experience at The Specialist! Johnny was great and he didn't presser us to spend more money. We got just what we needed for my daughters car. 
Because if Johnny and his crew I will use them again and let everyone know what a great experience we had."
__label__5	This is a really cool place, a bunch of stuff going on. The ambience is super cool, obviously live music (Nashville). The ribs (got them dry) were really good, the beans so tasty, greens were ok. Also the food came out so fast. We were seating at the bar, our bartender was extremely helpful, great drinks recommendations and the service was exceptional. Totally a place to visit while in Nashville.
__label__5	This was such a cool hangout spot. The food was delicious and was a perfect fit for the vibe of the location. Upstairs had a game room and cool hangout spot...very casual. Downstairs was also nice and had live music. Will definitely be back.
__label__5	Voted Best Bakery 2019 in the Trenton Favorites contest
__label__3	Nice place to watch the game & good prices. Food was good. Definitely do not get Hot and expect it to be like other places. Hot here is like extreme can't eat hot lol wish I would have gotten medium. They definitely cut portion sizes on the appetizer platter. I think staff is very low due to covid now because it took 30 minutes to be given water and over a hour for the food to come out. I wouldn't recommend unless you plan to be there for hours for a game. Will be back to watch more games but they do need improvements.
__label__4	Flavorful, authentic Jamaican cuisine. Wonderful service (Thanks Sarah & Auntie). A truly enjoyable dining experience!  Get off the beaten path and try this place!
__label__5	Great juice bar in reading terminal market. Order from the menu or create your own. Was convenient to hotel I was staying at. Nothing fancy but good fast and friendly service.
__label__1	I stayed there recently for my niece wedding and got bedbug bites!  I would never stay there again!  Once I called to report it they changed from nice and polite to rude and even went so far as to practically accuse me of lying.  They handled it so wrong.  I would recommend staying somewhere el
__label__5	Best Italian Grinder we've ever had! We'll definitely be back from Michigan for this! :)
__label__5	My first visit to La Croissette since the new ownership. Sky was my server and she was a delight. The food was great, I love the new patio and the service was fantastic. Thank you guys!
__label__5	I love this coffee shop! Delicious coffee choices and a great place to relax and do some work
__label__1	I come from working in the hospitality business and know how important it is to make things right for our customers and make sure they would want to use us again in the future. Even with hearing back from the business owner, I have read other reviews and have seen the same reply. Will anything truly be done to make it right? I stayed at a hotel 6 in Reno that was nicer than this place. The owner can read my review but it still hasn't changed and I'm still a very unhappy guest. I won't be staying here again.
__label__5	Simply unbelievable. Walk in with 5 dollars looking for a quality t-shirt, and you'll get it! Fantastic owner who works hard and cares about what he does, best deal in philly!
__label__5	I always have a wonderful experience visiting the Yardley Inn. The food is fantastic and the atmosphere is cozy and classy. Excellent salmon! Very charming and would recommend for a nice afternoon or evening out!
__label__5	LOVE the chicken broth on the pho! every time it's great. I get it without meat and extra veggies but that chicken broth -- that's what I come for. Staff is great and efficient.
__label__5	Stumbled on this place visiting Delmar neighborhood.  Great place!  Got the south beach burrito and chips & salsa!  Waitress said the best thing on the menu was the street corn on the cob and she was right!  Not your typical Tex-Mex menu!  Try it....
__label__1	Staff was extremely rude . Food was awful and no one was keeping their hands clean I will never go back
__label__5	We were attending a family wedding in Santa Barbara. I looked on Yelp for a top rated salon in Santa Barbara. The Carlyle Salon was rated very high. I called and was able to schedule 3 hair and make-up appointments. I highly recommend the Carlyle Salon. The salon is beautiful, our hair and make-up look great, they are friendly and we were served mimosa's! Rose and Cynthia were awesome with make-up and Krysta did a beautiful up do on one and beautiful blowouts on the others.
__label__4	"My girl Amy & I did a ""burger brunch"" at Juicy Lucy's the Sunday before Isaac hit. It was lovely! Attentive service, delicious burgers and a KILLER bloody mary! The bartender was right when he said their bloody mary was great.:) I recommend trying the specials they have to offer (that day it was a macaroni & cheese & bacon stuffed Lucy) Mmmmmm! And yes, take the onion ring recommendation too!"
__label__1	"Not sure how this place has so many good reviews. Got takeout last week and we were very disappointed. 
To begin with, service was terrible! Cashier was very rude and acted like we were disturbing her even though we were the only ones there. 
The food came out quick enough but it was very bland. How does a Chinese place mess up chicken fried rice?? The other dishes we ordered weren't very tasty either. Won't be back!"
__label__3	"Miss Claudia's is a great little costume shop, right around the corner from my place. I find myself coming here for last minute costume touches, but never for any huge elaborate piece for my costumes. 

The prices vary pretty greatly, and I often seem to find a better vintage selection going to a place like Funky Monkey or Salvation Army. On the costume end, I enjoy their wide variety of sunglasses, tights, gloves, ruffle undies, tutus, etc. 

I really enjoy their staff, as they are willing to help and order new pieces for you if you're in a pinch!"
__label__5	Cannot say enough about Emily   She is an experienced professional who takes pride in her work. Uncanny ability to remember my drink preference since my second visit - and it's not simple!! Food is excellent only outshined by the staff. Highly recommend!!
__label__4	There was a line outside this place, as there was a line at every other restaurant in the area, and came here strictly for the oysters. The oysters were okay to me. The deep fried alligator though was really good, but came here to compare oysters. I wasn't too impressed, yet it was good enough.
__label__4	Audrey's breakfast hash and biscuits with fresh fruit side dish. Best hash I ever had. Love their baked goods and great service.
__label__4	Looking for a dive bar with great food this is your place. We opted to sit outside on their small deck. The food was surprisingly good. I started with buffalo shrimp which I loved and based on someone else's review got the fish tacos ( which is an app)  as my meal. That was a good call. My husband had a chicken sandwich which he said was a full breast butterflied and seasoned with a rub which was very tasty. My son had buffalo wings and their onion rings which were delish.
__label__1	Not long distance they are scam artists. They ask for deposit but this is Illegal. They are the dumb ones if they really think they can scam a deposit from someone and give them a bs bill of lading and ignore your calls until you want your money back. They might be capable of a short move but absolutely positively no way anything else.  Use a larger company pay the same AND there are no brokers involved. All My Scammers....
__label__5	I've been to their cafes before and they were nice but this one really takes the cake! I love that they have closed conference areas upstairs, plenty of space and great food and coffee. I stopped in here in August for a quick ice coffee and croissant but I plan to go back to make use of the other facilities. What a great idea in the design and amenities.
__label__5	Took Larry to see Dr Winchester to remove a mole.  Dr. Was great and we were in on time and the procedure for what it was went smoothly and we couldn't be more pleased.  They called that evening to see how he was doing. Good job Ada West Dermatology staff and Dr. Winchester.
__label__5	Great local bar. Love going there for bike nights in the summer. Volleyball is a blast there
__label__5	I'm not a fan of the fancy donuts.  They're too sweet.  Now that that's out of the way, this is the best GD fried chicken on the planet!  THE BEST I tells ya.
__label__5	Hannah is wonderful! I have come to her several times for waxing and tinting.  She always remember me and we have great conversations while she works her magic! I highly recommend her.
__label__5	Popped in here a few times and they always got some killer live music going on.  Heavy blues trio bands.  Just amazing to be able to walk in off the street and get treated to this kinda down home blues!! Love New Orleans!! Oh, the bartenders here awesome!! Great pours and super friendly...like everyone in nola!
__label__4	"Ordered in.   chicken pesto pizza

Nice and garlicky :)"
__label__4	"Charming spot. Historical home turned into a brunch/lunch locale. 

Food was good! 
Portions are average to small. 
Cinnamon apple bread pudding was delicious. I recommend it. 

One piece of constructive criticism is if you're going to market yourselves as a ""tea room"", you should have authentic loose leaf tea being served with small pots of hot water. Not just different flavors in tea bags served in a mug. 

Service was decent.."
__label__2	I had Pad Thai with shrimp , which I order a lot.  It was the worst version of this I've ever had.  It was greasy and the noodles were mushy.  The sauce has too much of a weird lime after taste.  My son has orange chicken which was average .  He also had fried rice which literally just involved rice that had oil and maybe a little soy sauce in it- no veggies. Gross.
__label__1	Very ratchet ugly ahh workers. Gives wrong food every time . I asked for some ketchup and she only gave me three little packets and I had 5 meals . They need new employees
__label__1	The solar system installed is not measuring up to the power output that was claimed.
__label__5	Love this place! My favorite is the Chai Tea. It's a great place to go with friends. We loved the food during Restaurant Week, and the chocolate samplers (the bon bons) are delicious. You have to make a reservation, but even without one, it was a 10-15 min. wait on a Saturday night. Service is great, staff was very polite and friendly.
__label__5	Best breakfast of my life, without a doubt. Tennessee sugar cured ham. Amazing.
__label__5	"Breakfast review. 

Really really good fried chicken and waffles. It comes with an insanely good chicken sausage gravy too. 

Service is great. Nice vibe."
__label__4	I ordered the chicken parm and it was pretty tasty. The pasta was a little good and the marinara sauce was nothing special but it was still great. The chicken was good and it came out very quickly, which makes me question how fresh it is. For the price this is a great little spot if you want some quick food that's not fast food. The quality is not excellent
__label__1	Ive only used their shuttle parking for the airport. Horrible! I had to wait 30 minutes after calling them to pick me up!
__label__5	Being of Puerto Rican descent, I was so excited to try these favorite dishes from my childhood. From the appetizers(alcapurrias & relents De papa) to the main dishes (Pernil , mofongo ,rice and beans)my family were all thoroughly impressed. I had the shrimp mofongo which was delicious. Everyone from Grandpa to my youngest son ate every savory bite. Be sure to enjoy a wonderful authentic meal when visiting Sazon!
__label__1	"Awful customer service today. They wanted my name written and signed be me on a receipt that said ""No Signature Required"". To add insult they refused to give me the condiment package I requested and said 1 pack of sweet n sour they charge for. The food was subpar, cold not fresh. Never again!"
__label__5	I love this place! The most friendly staff around, beautiful plating, and amazing food. If you are downtown and don't stop in you are missing out. I recommend any of the curries, so good, I always have the penang beef. They also have the best fried rice in town. Start your meal with the crispy spring rolls or the corn todmun.
__label__1	Terrible. I brought my nephew here for his 3 year old photos. We had a 2:45 appointment so when we checked in I was told it would be a 20 minute wait, not a big deal. One hour and fourthly five minutes later they finally got us in there, and no surprise the tired/ hungry 3 year old was now no longer cooperative. The 'photographer' was incredibly rude when I brought up the ridiculous wait and tried to blame other kids taking too long for the almost 2 hour delay, not their incompetence.
__label__4	Nice location even though parking can be a bit of a challenge if eating in. Typical McDonald's fare. Quick and hot. Nice indoor atmosphere.
__label__2	This 2 star review is for the family dining side of the restaurant. We always enjoy the the bar side however recently we couldn't get in the bar side so we went to the family side. Won't ever again. Service was a total joke.  Chicken fingers were burnt. Cheeseburger didn't have any cheese on it. Never saw the waitress again after ordering  until she brought us our check.
__label__4	"Only 1 visit for lunch, but it was very good. Veggies were cooked just right, salads were crisp and fresh. Nothing too overpowering. Portions were reasonable. I'm not an expert on Mex or Tex, but it's done with care and fresh ingredients, I'm happy.

Staff were pleasant and service was fast. Surprisingly good coffee too."
__label__2	"Just go to Outback if you want a similar steak. Less crowded and better in my opinion. 

Just didnt like my NY Strip or really anything about the food. I'd come back, but wouldn't be under my suggestion"
__label__1	Awful, I do not know why we went back there.  They screwed up previous orders but we went back one more time.  What a mistake.  The cake was dry and did not appear to be fresh even though we ordered it days in advance.  Save your money and time and go somewhere else.  We will never be back.
__label__3	its okay not great. if you are looking for Mexican cuisine with a wide selection of choices go somewhere else. limited menu, guacomole was the only thing that made the experience
__label__4	"A real mixed bag here. Excellent beer selection, many hard to find beers. All that I tried were good. For food - My crawfish Etourffee was really good, fried oysters were also good. Didn't care for the collards, way too salty, the mac and cheese was ok but nothing to write home about, and I had a taste of the vegan ""pulled pork"" sandwich which wasn't that good. The service was also a mixed bag. Took forever to get seated but the waiter we had was awesome."
__label__4	Pho tai was decent. The meat wasn't as soft and tender. Spring roll was good.  I'm giving them an extra star for letting myself dirty the bathroom after being in the desert.
__label__1	This is the large dunkaccino I got... maybe 4/3 cup full.. I swear I didn't drink it... and he didn't even know where to look for it on the machine to bill me, instead he billed me for hot chocolate... well I don't know the price anyways. I go there because it's close to home... I guess I will go to another one then lol
__label__1	Doesn't respond to emails, phone calls, messages. I was trying to make arrangements for a large party and couldn't get ahold of anyone here. I hope the experience of being at the restaurant is better than trying to get in.
__label__2	"Went again to check out ""updates and improvements"".  Some surfaces replaced, but still faulty plumbing, gross flooring in work out areas and strange, entitled vibe.  

Have to pay for too many extras that should be included -- ""functional training"" a way to make extra money when it should be included on a sign up basis

No thanks!"
__label__5	I love this practice.  I see Dr. De la Paz. She's very thorough and approachable. Very efficient online patient portal too.
__label__2	This place's pho was not good at all. The broth is the staple for pho and this was so bland sriracha and hoisin sauce couldn't really help. I went during lunch time and there wasn't a lot of people which should have showed me to look for another place. Don't think I'll come back here
__label__1	"I was pretty upset with this place for serving what they claimed was ""toro"" and it was a hard, flat, chewy piece of crap.  Really, I'm not normally that rough on a place, but it was unacceptable and showed a complete lack of interest in serving quality product.  Maybe their teppanyaki is better?  I would hope so.  It would be hard to be worse than the sushi."
__label__3	Love the trolley car but it is always ridiculously crowded on weekends. My kids like it here to but hate having to wait for a table and then wait for food- pretty good food, great take-out beer selection
__label__4	"We were lucky enough to choose a good night for take out.

As others have reviewed it is not always an option.  BUT, a well managed restaurant knows when their staff is at capacity and they can not take on additional business that would lessen the dining experience of their customers in the restaurant.

Our take out ws prompt, packaged perfectly and warm after our 10 minute ride back to our place.

The eggplant rollatini and cesare salad were delightful.  Thanks to the friendly and courteous staff.  

We will be back."
__label__3	Mad Rex had an awesome feel to the inside of the restaurant, however i ordered a steak off the survivor menu and it almost wasn't edible due to how poor the cut was. there was more fat than beef. i was excited to try cooking on the lava rock but it didn't do too much for me after seeing the cut of steak i received. if i found out they fixed this issue i would return. otherwise id spend my money elsewhere.
__label__5	Great bagels and friendly service. The bagels are HUGE--one bagel is as big as both of my palms. Bagels are fluffy and soft and they definitely don't skimp on the cream cheese. The owners are really nice and interested in how you found out about them (told them Yelp and they proudly showed off their Best of Yelp award). I got sweet bagels/spreads so I'm interested to go back and try something savory.
__label__1	The food was extremely salty and tasted old. After the first bite, I left the food, paid the outrageous bill and left. Will not going back there again. Not recommended!
__label__1	Luggage was forced to be checked. Going to another country didn't feel comfortable. Flight attendants explained there was no room. Came into the flight and there was 8 spots open to place bags. Definitely received poor customer service.. 5th time flying with Delta and they've lost my bags in the past.
__label__3	"Extremely disappointed with this place...not much steak and the bread was just alright. Came here at midnight and no line, a few people in the store eating a cheesesteak and I had high expectation since there were still people around. Took a bite in with the wiz and felt that there was not enough steak.

The pickles and hot peppers were really good tho!"
__label__4	"Enjoyed our stay here. Rooms are very clean and quiet. We had a room overlooking garden. Very pretty. Hotel information folks were kind and very accomodating. Not sure how the room service works. We ordered one night and had to go and get it ourselves and pay down in restaurant. What is the point in ""room service"" when there is none... otherwise very pleased with stay. Very convenient to everything. Pretty much can walk everywhere..."
__label__5	"Went to LouVino for brunch and it was awesome. First off, $2 mimosas?! Sign me up. 
For brunch I ordered the French toast and boy oh boy was it yummy. I was the first person at my table to finish eating. It was really filling - I liked it a lot. The mimosas were cheap but just ""ok"", nothing to write home about. I liked the restaurant a lot and the wait staff were all very nice. Easy 5/5."
__label__3	"The food is definitely overpriced, but then again when you're on Old Metairie Rd in Old Metairie, you have to expect as a consumer that you paying the mortgage.

The food was good, not great but good, hopefully in time they'll settle in on a menu that works for them. SInce this is a new restaurant my expectations weren't too high.


It is a little weird when you walk into a Vietnamese restaurant that's design almost makes you feel like you are in a Frozen Yogurt shop, but maybe that's just me."
__label__5	I went to Luxicure on a whim with my mom to destress from the Holidays. It was a great choice! The place was beautifully clean, well priced, and the service was great. I'll definitely be back whenever I'm visiting.
__label__5	Everything we ordered for brunch was so amazing. We had a party of 5 and every person cleared their plate. The lattes were amazing and we can't wait to come back!
__label__5	Great service and even had multiple servers come to our table to ensure we were doing well. Food was great and reasonably priced. They were a little skeptical about the 10% yelp offer though, but it worked :)
__label__2	This is a weird pizzeria to walk into if you are not a regular and friends with the workers.  Once you walk in, everyone will stop what they're doing and turn around to stare at you.  Its almost as if you've stumbled into someone's home uninvited.  This is not just me either;  I've talked with more than several people (coworkers, friends) who experienced this too.  I may be paranoid but this pizza shop indeed has a weird vibe.  Oh, by the way, the pizza isn't bad.  It reminds me of roller rink pizza.
__label__1	"Awful, awful experience.   Low-ball quote, said he was insured then charged me for it, quoted me one rate for additional hours then wouldn't unload the truck until I paid higher rate ... left furniture unassembled, and had many broken and damaged items.

AWFUL!"
__label__4	"Bubble tea- a must try. The texture is more like a frozen smoothie so the ""tea"" is a bit misleading for newbies, but its great. The coconut and green tea flavors are my favorite, a bit of a splurge in terms of calories and $ but worth it as an occasional treat. I've never tried their pocket sandwiches but they seem interesting... I'll be sure to try them and report back with an updated review."
__label__3	Good but VERY small portions for the price. Order extra meat and they don't use breast meat.
__label__1	Not a fan. I'm sure you run into this anywhere but the lack off communication between staff,doctors and patients is insane. I was sent to the wrong waiting room twice. Sat in an out patient room for 2 hours when my wife had been out of surgery and moved to a room but no one knew what was going on. I wish the staff in the hospital has some avenue of communication as everyone seems to not know what the other is doing. Was told my wife would be released very soon and that was 4 hours ago.
__label__4	Saw Nikki last week and was pleasantly surprised after a not-so-great budoir photo session at another studio last year.  She has a great sense of humor and instantly put me at ease.  She helped me choose my outfits and the photos were very flattering.  I would highly recommend a photo shoot at her studio.
__label__1	I took my toy poodle to this place for a full cut, and after 5 hours of waiting, I got her back nice and clean. However, the hair was not clipped, she still had the 2 mats I told the groomer about. The tail was not touched and looked dirty. Her feet were not trimmed until after I got there to pick her up and I again asked to have them done. I guess the single star accounts for the fact that they bathe her and brushed her; a 45 minute job done in 5 hours for the full price of $44.00.
__label__1	The decor is nice but the food is not great.  I was pretty disappointed when we went for lunch.  The service wasn't great either and it wasn't even crowded.  If you want authentic Mexican food try Los Amigos in Ruskin, Taco Rey in Brandon or Sabor a Mexico in Valrico/Brandon
__label__5	Always makes for a fun outing! Great place to walk, run, and enjoy the scenery and outdoors.
__label__5	We went here on our vacation for a bachelorette party. They were so accommodating! The food was so amazing and delicious. The owner was awesome and so nice! The staff was very nice and on point. We want to come back for every meal. Definitely recommend them for all our friends!!
__label__5	The presentation and quality of the plated food was very surprising in a good way!  Very well presented and beautiful colors on the dish.  I was also pleased with the service and price of the meal.  I would recommend to anyone who enjoys Thai cuisine.
__label__5	Great Vibe! Very interesting pieces. I picked up a few vinyls, vintage italian boots, and reveal glasses for my boyfriend's bar! Oh and a pair of beautiful dutch white porcelain and wood lamps. Great place to shop!
__label__5	Thank god. After both our go to Mexican places sold out (they have the same generic menu, prices went up and quality went down :( ) we tried this place on a whim. So good. The grilled chicken was smoky and tender, enchiladas were on point, and the salsa was fresh and spicy. Service was polite and friendly and quick!! Our new fav!
__label__1	By far will NEVER GO HERE AGAIN. had a service dog and was told I couldn't bring him in.  And then Manager wanted to agree with me about things that happened  his was rude and obnoxious! I will let all 20k + followers on Facebook know not to go there   I should really see an attorney as what they did violates federal law and the ADA act
__label__5	Awesome food with great vibes. Lady at cashier is very pleasant. She even came to my table to chit chat. I got the fire pepper roasted burger and it is perfection!!!!
__label__5	"Art's Pit Stop has been around for a long time. I can't say for sure how long, but ever since I was a kid they have been in business.
Local business and they have a reputation for doing good work.

I definitely recommend this business!!"
__label__1	"OH NO!  The place has changed owners and bears no resemblance to its former self.  You can't serve three chunks of stewing beef and call it a ""strip steak"".  You can't serve a lump of mushy, snow-white converted rice in a bowl with a thin, yellow broth, scattered mixed veg (broccoli?), and a tiny slice of fish and call that ""Paella"".  Nothing made sense, including preserving the Italian name and then not serving Italian cuisine.  Felt like an s-show rapidly approaching its death spiral."
__label__1	"The size of this place was never meant to be a restaurant - the moment you walk in you feel a little claustrophobic. On top of that they insist on playing jazz music that's way too bass heavy for me to be relaxed and focused on my food that's trying to fight for space on my minuscule table. I think the food was okay - I couldn't tell, nor did I care. I left as soon as I could and never looking back.

Do yourself a favor and buy a breaded chicken wawa hoagie and sit on the park bench at fitler square instead."
__label__1	Hit the drive thru yesterday. The service was horrible!  And the food was even worse!  I now remember why I never eat there!
__label__5	Ordered in one nite and heard this was good. Ordered a pizza and single handedly ate the whole thing. Enough said.
__label__3	Been to this place several times. Not much competition in the area for any food places much less chinese. While I dont consider myself a chinese food snob by any stretch, this place is ok but not slap your gramma good either. Apparently you cannot say the word Chi-com in your review or the SF snowflake review board will get offended. Yelp on!
__label__2	"Was there recently.  Just ordered some bagels and although they were right behind the counter, I was given a table number placard.  I waited until all the orders that needed assembly or cooking prior to mine were filled.  It tool me over fifteen (15) minutes to get some whole bagels in a bag, not to mention that they were sliced even though I did not ask for that.

The bagels themselves were a bit dense, compared to NY bagels."
__label__5	"This is only for the lunch buffet!

I freaking love it! Great options every time, and they have my heart explicitly because they have idli and sambar every time. Honestly, I'll eat at Karma buffet for lunch and that's my meal for the day.

Some of my friends also like to get the buffet to-go, which is a really cool option to offer. I personally like to sit down, and I like that the seating area is farther away from the bustle of Market Street. I feel relaxed when I'm there, and leave warm and full. Lovely."
__label__5	This is a wonderful surprise tucked away in a small street/alleyway. We didn't know it existed even though we walk around Doylestown all the time. Never noticed it. Well, we're sure glad we did today! We got their lobster and butternut squash and it was excellent. They included 2 of their absolutely sinfully good biscuits and we were in heaven! We had our dog with us so they gave us 2 dog biscuits as well which was so very sweet! We will absolutely be back!!!
__label__1	I bought a SUV from here and they told me it was in great condition and had just been inspected and there was no problems. When I had it inspected a year later at a mechanic near my home he asked if I had any work recently done on it. I told him no. He informed me someone had done work on my car at some point and never hooked the emergency brake back up. On top of that it needed about $2000 worth of stuff done to it. I had been driving my kids around in that car! I will never buy from them again.
__label__1	Not much to say except you don't get what you paid for, whole meal was downsized. Thanks Buffalo Wild Wings.
__label__5	I had a last minute event and needed to provide a meal for approx. 30 people. I called Rick's Pizza and they more than happy to accommodate. We had multiple people with special requests and the team at Rick's got everything perfect. The food was awesome and fresh and  everyone was very happy with the order. I will definitely be making this my go to in the future for all events.
__label__5	They fixed my toe nail a few years back and to this day I'm still grateful for them.  It instantly took away the pain and it lasted until the nail grew out.  This place is great!
__label__2	"Beware of the 2 for one emails you receive. My daughter and I periodically go for a pedicure together and we thought this would be a great last minute opportunity. When we booked it on line it appeared that we chose one that was under the ""special"" but learned after the fact it was not. Paid for 2 over priced, for what you receive, pedicures."
__label__5	I like the vibe here better than the one by Canal, It's least touristy IMO. Personally, the Bloody Mary felt like it needed more tomato juice but other than that, everything was on point.
__label__2	"For some reason the breakfast took a hour to make after placing order then came lukewarm tasted good but was warm. We spoke with the manager who then covered are bill which we did ask for. Server was great. Give yourself lots of time if you eat there which we didn't have.
Manager cared 
Server  good"
__label__5	Used Olga many times and have always been happy. Really appreciate how fast she responds to any questions I have or request for short notice cleaning.
__label__2	"I picked this hotel based on cost, but knowing what I know now I would have gladly spent more money and stayed elsewhere.
I received the poorest customer service EVER at the front desk.  Leslie tried to send me to the other Drury down the street AND the MARRIOTT. Wow. 
Room was clean and I was left extra towels after I left a little note in the room.
Breakfast was decent and almost compensated for the other issues since I could grab breakfast before my 2 days of meetings."
__label__4	Great prices, slow lines at checkout, very little employees on the sales floor. Overall the value will keep you going back.
__label__4	"This is such a cool business with a very distinct character. The owners are very interesting friendly people always willing to lend their opinions. Beer selection is fantastic. You can't beat the baked goods. A little bit on the expensive side. Be sure to seek out an act on advice of the staff to get the most out of the experiance. And if asked if you waltz just say ""Yes I do"" it can save you from a lecture."
__label__5	"One of my absolute favorite places to eat out in my area. The food is delicious, healthier than all other burger places around, and affordable. I also met Kyle, the young man who inspired the restaurant's mission. He was a sweet, kind young man who noticed I was having a bad day and offered a hug. 

The restaurant's mission is to foster connections between the community and those with special needs. I can't think of a better cause to support in addition to getting a nice meal. 10/10 highly recommended."
__label__2	"Too many broken pieces of equipment. Pads cracked.
Comparison to other locations such as Bala Cynwyd"
__label__3	Typical chinese take out. Service was good, fast and friendly. Food was good.
__label__1	Worst taco bell To go to ! Rude and terrible customer service and noisey workers when I asked for my receipt they replied with why ! They're out of so many Ingredients never again will I return
__label__5	"April Saves Christmas! 
Just moved to FL and became a stylist nomad going from one stylist debacle after another, searching for my new hair home.  
With my fingers crossed I booked my appt with April and I am happy to report she is a true professional who knows her business.  
I have found my new home."
__label__4	If you do not like raw oysters (like me) you should try the charred oysters because they are very good at Felix's.
__label__4	Dropped in for a quick get together on Christmas Eve. My main man and I loved it so much--the atmosphere, the service, the drinks--that we stayed longer than anticipated! I recommend the black and white mocha drink to anyone looking for something bold but still light and tasty. Even the drink art is exceptional. This place is truly a treat to behold and taste.
__label__2	Probably the most expensive Vietnamese restaurant I have been. The value, quality, and amount of the food compared to the price is ridiculous. The only thing on the menu that is worth it might be the bubble waffle. Other than that, I recommend going elsewhere.
__label__4	"The tast was awesome and definitely worth going to over Geno's.  The line moves fast and they request that you order it Philly style ""wit or witout onions"". Definitely get it with cheeze whiz and onions because that's classic. It only lost a point because the meat was a little grissley and the Pepsi tasted a little like coke. Overall two very enthusiastic thumbs up."
__label__5	"Outstanding in every way:
     Food - delicious with a beautiful presentation. 
     Ambiance - warm, inviting and not too noisy.
     Staff - excellent server. Very friendly staff. 
     Value - well worth it. 
      A great find for a vegetarian restaurant."
__label__5	I absolutely love our table. It is a piece of art and lovingly made. Paul and his team are excellent. Thank you for creating a table that is now an heirloom!
__label__2	We drove from Murfreesboro to come here. Let's just say it wasn't worth it. The food was all stale and looked like it had been sitting there all day (most veggies were literally shriveled up and dried out from sitting under a heat lamp) which is a health code violation. The bathrooms had no toilet paper and had a nasty stench. There was also a very limited choice of foods. The cooks were all sitting in corners on their phones behind the food lines. The only redeeming quality was our waiter, Richard, who was so sweet and welcoming.
__label__5	Literally the best fried chicken I've ever had anyway, and I've had A LOT of fried chicken. The owner Wendy is amazing. She's committed to bringing you the best experience possible. Prices are very reasonable. And if you gotta be boujie with your fried chicken, you can order a bottle of Veuve or Dom Perignon!
__label__5	Seems like a place where locals go. Everyone at the bar seemed to know each other (including the bartender). Good selection of craft beers from Tennessee and also different states. Board games on a shelf near the bar!
__label__4	Char-grilled Oysters are AMAZING! Fried oysters are outstanding! Red beans and rice is a tasty dish. If I ever have another chance to dine at Acme Oyster House, I would definitely have Char-grilled Oysters followed immediately by the Pecan Cobbler, one of the best 3 desserts I've ever eaten!
__label__3	Tried this place for the first time (local). I'll say the decor is very nice but also very common for the area. Overall the food was ok but not great. We had small plates and entrees as well as both desserts. With that being said I think I had enough to get a good gauge on the restaurant. I don't think I'll be back unless it's to pregame it for drinks.
__label__5	Ethan (our waiter) was excellent! Food was amazing! Highly recommend grilled cheese and tomato soup and the burrata tomato avocado salad. They have a Mimosa for 2 with passion fruit worth checking out. Great food excellent service and atmosphere!
__label__5	Amazing work!! Contacted Premier through yelp and was immediately responded to with pricing information. Set up an appointment to have my girlfriends '16 Toyota Corolla tinted. Arrived and was immediately greeted by the owner Garret and my vehicle taken in the back right away. I was actually able to watch the entire process which was performed by the owner which I liked, assuring quality work. I would recommend this business time and time again! Thanks Garret!
__label__1	The wait time is always horrendous, and despite the long wait the food is almost always stale and tastes like it's been sitting out forever.
__label__5	I have been coming here for a couple of years now and am a bit ashamed that I've never taken the time to complete a review. I think it's human nature to quickly post when dissatisfied. Well, that has never been the case here. The service is quick and the servers always friendly and competent. The food is fresh and absolutely delicious. I had lamb down the street and it was awful. The prices are also great for the amount of food you get. I promise you. If you try it, you will definitely agree that the service and the food are both outstand
__label__5	Food is sooooo good!!!! Went for happy hour so got two dollar tacos. And they're all super good, loved the grilled chicken the best. The chili crusted fries were super delicious too! I didn't get a drink but my boyfriend got some zombie drink and said it was the best drink ever! Friendly service
__label__4	Awesome service and the open face tamale appetizer was fantastic. Creative and tasty cocktail menu.
__label__1	Water is super cold and too small area for the kids to play very frustrated experience
__label__3	"I come here once in a while because it's close to home. Service is usually friendly. I've been in a couple times since the Holiday Drinks have been out and they have been out if the skinny mocha syrup each time. This is not something that is random.  I have found that they do not always have their products in stock. This can be frustrating when you are expecting a certain specialty coffee. 
Parking is usually limited because of the other businesses around. Drive through is usually pretty easy to get through.  It is always warm and friendly when we go in."
__label__5	I ordered a cake for my mother-in-law's 80th birthday party from Potito's. It was great!! So many people came up and asked me where it came from because they really loved it. The owner was extremely helpful and helping me to get the right flavors and size. We ended up ordering a chocolate cake with chocolate icing. They added several vanilla cupcakes with vanilla icing in addition to the cake. What a great idea! I never thought about the people that don't love chocolate, but Potito's did. I'll definitely order from them again!
__label__4	Came here last December after seeing that they delivered. But then has to call to confirm that my work place was too far for delivery lol. Stopped by on the way to work and got the Filler which has pork roll, scrapple, bacon, eggs, sausage and American cheese. The only thing I maybe should of added was ham lol. It's pretty good with the buffalo sauce and nicely packed inside the kaiser bun.  I'll have to stop in again since they have a lot of good looking items although traffic stinks in the morning on 70 lol
__label__5	Got a referral from our realtor (Fazzini Group- EXCELLENT!!), I called and they were very responsive.  Called the day they were supposed to come and gave me a time.  Came in that time period.  Did a great job on the work that needed to be done (two corroded laundry faucets).  The guy who did the work was friendly and did excellent work.  I recommend them highly.
__label__5	First heard about these guys because we use them at work.  They always treated us good, whereas many vendors in the past once they had a contract wouldn't.  These guys are first rate.  So when I need a battery for my personal vehicle I didn't hesitate to go there.  I had never had personal contact with any of them, but was treated well and found the staff to be very knowledgeable.  Great prices, great staff and so far a great battery.  Highly recommend.
__label__2	A friend of mine took me here...she said it's the best....it does have a great location..fun especially before a show at the KF...but mmmehhhh foods mediocre. So the next time my friend suggests a place I'm gonna make her pay lol
__label__5	This is our go to Chinese place in Sparks.  Always fresh always fast and the owners are super nice people.
__label__5	Absolutely DELICIOUS! The Stuffed Chicken Breast is TO DIE FOR, HANDS DOWN ONE OF MY FAVORITE MEALS! Husband had the Cajun Chicken Fettuccini and loved it! Great service by Barry and the manager, Paul was so kind! One of our new favorite places!
__label__5	Wonderful customer service, great atmosphere, and the food is to die for. Highly recommend!
__label__5	This place has inspired me to make my own bagel sandwiches, but not of mine compare to the fresh, steamed goodness of Ripple Bagel & Deli. Experience this for yourself.
__label__5	Awesome little place! We visited a few weeks ago and went for breakfast two days in a row. The service was awesome each time and the food was fantastic.
__label__5	Can't speak to their food, but this is hands-down my favorite small venue in Philly. They've got a balcony that's practically right in front of the stage, so you'll have a great vantage point from almost anywhere - service has always been excellent at the bars upstairs, and decent selection of beers.
__label__3	Love the hostess at the front w the pig tails!!!! But it's a tourist trap and the service was trash. However my beans were in fact not cold but a bit Luke warm! Salsa was spicy, marg was fresh and the fajitas gave you FOUR TINY BITES of chicken.
__label__1	Still old and run down. Slow service is the norm here. This place needs to be bulldozed. So slow.
__label__5	This place is no joke at all! Maybe a little outta the way, but they are the best! Fresh catch ALL the time. You will have to wait, but IT SO worth it! If fried is your thing, they have plenty of that too! Hidden gem of SJ!
__label__5	I loved the food and the service at this restaurant! Great environment and vibe. Alex and Nick were so friendly and attentive to our requests. Will definitely return!
__label__5	Great food & environment. Jared was great, friendly & welcoming. The Mac & Cheese is awesome!  Great place will come back soon.
__label__4	This is a neighborhood bar of ours and we love it!  Good seating and lots of great beers on tap.  It's right off seventh and an easy stop for a hour hour drink.  The menu prices are more expensive than I would expect.  BUT their food is generally really good.  I used to go quite regularly (one a week) and only a few times got food that was just in the middle.  We don't go there as much not because of that but because we eat at home more often to save some $$.
__label__5	I came back for Burgers and a World Series Victory happened.  The burgers are great. It may be all they serve but man those things really hit the spot when you are drinking.
__label__3	Meh.  Pork katZu was okay but the pineapple coke slaw also ok.  Pretty processed feeling. Raving about the chicken Katsu, but they were out so perhaps that is better but the pork was heavy And I was not super impressed. Always been getting to go food I give the benefit of the doubt but... For the price I wouldn't do this again
__label__5	Amazing and I'm picky! We had our first pie today from them and I'd highly recommend them! Bacon pizza is the best!!!!
__label__1	"Not sure why everyone raves about Tin Roof. The tacos are dry, not flavorful and too expensive.
Skip it and try anywhere else"
__label__5	Mushroom soup with no dairy but as creamy and delicious as i have ever had.  Vegetable rolls were light and tasty.  Great atmosphere and service in an asian atmosphere.
__label__4	Ijji is a good go-to sushi place. The rolls aren't anything super exotic but they are always good.  They have gluten free soy sauce; however they do use regular flour in their tempora instead of just rice flour. Service is always good and when we have friends from out of town, people who are new to sushi or just want a good night of sushi this is our go-to.
__label__5	Great food, awesome staff and quick service! It's not a gourmet nor is it good looking to the eyes necessarily. But boy does it stuff you and makes me want to keep coming back for more. When I lived in St. Louis, I went here probably 3 times a week sometimes more. Love it! The owner was fantastic, rest in peace. He was so kind to me and my friends and family. Can't wait to go back. Love it all!!
__label__4	Service was friendly and helpful. We tried the lamb korma and butter chicken. Both we very good. I will definitely be returning.
__label__4	Stopped by after a friend told me about this place the staff was very nice I enjoyed the limited menu however the portions were small leaving me hungry again after about an hour I had the meat balls and a side of carrots
__label__4	"Fun place and great date spot. I love the VIP lounge feel of the bays, although the wait -even with a reservation- can be very long. There's plenty to do in the meantime: live music, video game rooms etc.

The drinks are great and the food is delicious. Bring back the shrimp & grits, please!"
__label__4	"It's New York Fries. They are quick, unhealthy but taste great.  I wouldn't make it a point to visit routinely but as an occasional treat it's great.

I usually get plain fries but they have a variety of pouting options and hot dogs.  

Join their Fry Society membership and get a free drink."
__label__4	Happily surprised, I wasn't sure about it at first because of the name, but have since realized the whimsy/fusion.  So far I have only tried the Korean Tacos and Rib-eye steak and rice bowl. Even the potato salad side that came with the bowl was really good and reminded me of my dad's version. I'll definitely be back.
__label__1	My dog and I are still traumatized by my appointment here. They didn't even acknowledge my dog while he was waiting by the front desk. Poor thing was so scared, he would have loved some attention or treats. Then the vet had the nerve to threaten me that my dog would have to be put down because the was panting anxiously and that MIGHT  lead to aggression. He had never, ever shown any aggression to him or any of the employees. I left feeling defeated and heart broken. I've since taken him to two other vet offices in Boise and never had any experience similar to this one
__label__4	Cool second location.  The staff is super friendly, Ryan and Stephanie served me and they were great!!  The coffee tasted good however it was not very hot.  I got the buttered rum latte, it had beautiful presentation!
__label__5	Best donuts hands down but make sure you reserve a few.  Nicola's donuts fly off the shelf.
__label__4	Luis the manager is a really cool guy! I've been slowly but surely making the conversion from Starbucks follower to Peet's enthusiast. Their pumpkin spiced latte is by far the best I have ever had! You win Peets, you win!
__label__3	"""Does the trick"" tex-mex food.  I didn't know this particular chain existed outside of Austin, but if you don't have many other local choices to go to, I would recommend eating here.  Granted, it has about a years worth of sodium and fat in any of their plates, but just go for the heart attack because it tastes good.  Try the chica-chica boom-boom plate.  It is quite good along with their house-made salsas."
__label__5	Offers up the best fried catfish sandwich and fried chicken. Breakfast and lunch also served.  Not for those looking for low calorie options.  Service and beer was very good. Live band was great.
__label__5	Very cute interior and there's an upper floor where you can sit as well. Very quiet but good service! I got the earl grey iced latte which was good, maybe better hot. The coffee is great as well!
__label__2	"Probably a wonderful bowling experience, however; very unprofessional. I called to make a reservation and requested information. The first woman I spoke to was very kind and helpful. I told her I would call right back and I did so. A gentleman answered the phone and when I shared the information that the kind woman had given me a put the phone down and then proceeded to have a shouting match with her about what the rules and policies were. 
Not cool at all! I hung up and proceeded to make a different plan for my wife's birthday."
__label__5	"Had this for lunch today. The chicken kebab over rice, with salad and tzatziki ""white"" sauce and a soda for only $5. They are quick, nice and make a tasty, economical lunch. Yes, I will come back when in UPenn area, as during week I work in Center City."
__label__5	Mason was amazing! I felt as if I had gone to a museum. He was knowledgeable and super attentive. Not to mention kind. Thank you so much! Please give him a raise. He's the reason I will be shipping gin to NJ! Thank you again! I did the tour which lasted an hour.
__label__1	Waiter was great! We tipped him the amount they took off for my girlfriends dried out pork chops. My $60 steak was grisly, not really marbled. Girlfriend has been here before and was not like it used to be. $104 meal could have been prepared at home for about $40. I wouldn't go there again.
__label__1	We have lived in the area for the past three winters and really enjoyed this buffet. Tonight after getting back to the area, we were excited to go back. First there was a filthy undescribable odor that was definitely sewage related. On top of that, the sushi did not taste fresh and much of the food was actually cold.  We will never go back again. Very dissatisfied and disappointed.
__label__1	my daughters worked here. but ive had enough of their irresponsible plastic packaging, bags, utensils. Natural cafe? BS
__label__5	Ordered an arrangement for my friend today and it was perfect.  The lady, Emily, that took my order was the most efficient person I have ordered anything from in a long time.   Thanks so much!
__label__5	I'm a new Catholic, but this has been my home Parish for 3 years now. Not only is the building beautiful, but the people inside it as well. They are very active in the community. Fr. Guy is a very humble man as well as relatable. His homilies make you want to listen and to integrate God's word into our lives and hearts.
__label__5	Great service. Freshly pressed tortillas! Ordered brisket tacos. Great. I mean great! Limited soft drink options. Coffee surprisingly good enough to mention. Wife loved it. Go here.
__label__5	I couldn't have nicer things to say about my experience at PP Media. I booked an appointment online, met with a lovely intake staff member and talked with a down to earth knowledgeable doctor within a half an hour who made me feel like I was talking to a really smart friend. I would recommend to any and all. They checked my insurance instantly and my procedure was covered save a little copay.
__label__5	I'm not typically an active Yelp reviewer, however, I was compelled to comment after an excellent experience at Rockfire Grill Friday night. I initially had a bit of trouble selecting a dinner option, but a lovely young women working the cashier (I believe her name was either Ashely or Aly, a delight regardless) recommenced the La Jolla Burger, which was fantastic! I can never resist quacamole, and the house sauce was to die for. My new favorite weekend spot!!
__label__2	Trying very hard to be a high-priced fine dining establishment, but all you get are small portions of food for an exorbitant price.  I've said this before, and I will say it again:  please don't charge me for chips and salsa.  Five bucks for a small 4-ounce bowl of salsa and a basket of chips is insane.  I will not be going to Zocalo again.
__label__4	"Okay I don't usually go to ""chains"" but they're not national (yet?) and I wanted BBQ, was driving by and liked the 4 star rating. 

Was not disappointed.   Great service,  great food.  Had the baby backs, burnt ends and sausage with a salad.  

All was good enough for me to say "" I will be back."""
__label__5	Saw the reviews and thought I'd give it a try. We had a Philly, a pizza, and cheesy bread stick. It was all awesome! They had great service, and a creative menu.
__label__3	"I know a lot of people are fans of this place but I find it just so so

I've never really had ""friendly"" service here. In fact it's been borderline rude. 

Drinks come fast enough but the food doesn't and when it does it's greasy or lukewarm.

I've been twice so I'll give them one more try, after the pandemic, and hopefully I can leave a better review"
__label__5	New great place in Boise. The best calzones in town!  Nice selection of beer and wine. Great salad bar. Lovely new facility with sports screens and quiet patio dining.  Pizza, burgers, great sandwiches and kid menu too.
__label__2	I have been shopping at TJs for years now. I have lived in several different states and each store seems consistent with the next. This location however never seems to be fully stocked. I actually stopped shopping here a few months back because every time I come here they didn't have something on my list. It wasn't worth the aggravation. Today, I come in thinking I can grab a few things and what do you know, ALL OUT of something I once again needed. I prefer the Whole Foods down the street.
__label__5	Great Italian beef and great Parmesan potatoes. The food was fresh and hot. I did salt my sandwich a little but that is just my preference. You get a great portion for your money. The owner was super nice. Quaint little place. I will definitely be back to try additional menu items.
__label__1	Horrible customer service!! Refused to delivery to Clearwater Beach which is less than 3 miles away. Restaurant stated they can deliver within 9 miles but driver refused a 2.4 mile drive.
__label__5	Park Avenue has become one of the places I bring family and friends visiting from out of town, not only for the great coffee/tea, the best Gooey Butter Cake, and the friendly service, but also for one of my favorite patios in St. Louis at the Lafayette Square Location.  The downtown location is also great--I only wish it was open later on both weeknights and weekends!
__label__5	So I finally made it back. They really are so good. They definitely did hook me up for forgetting one side salad. Which is just human error. I truly love that you get really good food in casual setting.
__label__3	Family run in non descript building on the White Horse Pike. No atmosphere and ok sushi. just didn't leave a great impression. Staff was very nice and wish I liked it more.
__label__5	"I couldn't leave Nashville without bringing with us some awesome Hazyness.  I have to thank a friend from the Atlanta Beer Community FB page, Mark C., who gave me a couple of tips on where I could find some good hazies. 

While I couldn't taste before I bought, the menu descriptions were sufficient to make a decision.  This place definitely deserves high praises for their creatively juicy hazy IPAs. Man these were good!  Well worth the trip.

Glad we stopped in."
__label__4	I stayed for 4 nights. Room was fine. Staff was friendly and helpful. Ate at restaurant once - not bad. Shuttle service was on time and good. Gym is adequate with treadmills and light weights. Overall I was pleased.
__label__4	I know.. I know.. I eat too much pizza, but who the hell can turn away from half price pie son!(NY accent) lol Look, they have happy hour a lot usually when I'm headed home from work so of course, I'm going to take advantage. Traditional STL thin crust, heavy toppings, lite sauce ton of cheese. The wings are A+ (highlights) hot mustard & hot glazed. the service is nice they even have a decent dining area with sports on the big flat screen. So if your hungry head over and get your fat kid on.
__label__5	Had a birthday early dinner tonight.  Food was great and service was great also. Everything was great.
__label__5	"Probably the freshest sushi you will find in Indianapolis! It was absolutely delicious. So many sushi options to choose from, in addition to all of the wonderful Japanese entrees they offer. 

The restaurant is quaint and one of a kind. Decorated with Japanese artwork and messages from previous diners. The staff was very attentive and passionate about their restaurant and guests. They truly wanted all of their guests to have an incredible experience and it shows!"
__label__4	Came here to kill some time, but it was a fun place.  Kids would love it as it's very hands on and many of their young staff are very engaging and knowledgeable.  You get to touch the shark, sea urchin, and starfish.  There was an area where you can bring down a pulley into the ocean and bring up sand to see what comes up.  Also a crabbing net although we didn't catch anything.  If you're fascinated about sea life and ocean or learning more about it, this is a place for you.
__label__2	Had great hopes for this Greek place, but someone needs to introduce the chef to his/her spice rack!  We had moussaka and spanokopita, both of which were BLAND. BLAND!!!
__label__3	one time i was eating here and this waitress came around the corner and spilled all three water glasses on me and my sisters heads. very wet. very cold. do not recommend. had mega tho i was so damn cold.
__label__2	"Recently went to Kung Fu tea.  Received $4 off couldn't use it and staff wasn't helpful at this location. Was charged 2X amount of $25 for rewards I didn't sign up for! 

The app needs to be clear with instructions and the store needs to hire staff who are helpful.  Spent $18 for 3 drinks which weren't good. 

I will not go to this Kung Fu tea at this location again !!!! 

Waiting notice from my bank to be refunded !!"
__label__5	All-time favorite place best value ever on a hotdog and a drink can't beat it for $1.50. The staff is always gracious and nice and the value is very good. If you need to shop in bulk this is the place to go or if you just wanna walk around and get some samples that are always awesome or just because you wanna work off some Calories walking around and sightseeing there's always something for everyone at Costco and right now they've got Christmas and I've got some really nice stuff
__label__5	I get the food bowl with juka. Always very tasty and filling. Owners are very nice and talkative.
__label__4	"Really freakin good vegan pizza, I wish we had this in NY! I would come a lot.

I had the haymaker slice and the one with mushrooms and I enjoyed both. I also tried their cheese fries which was a bit odd because the cheese sauce tasted funny, not sure what it was made with. Still, I don't ever turn down fries.

I am sure to come back when I visit philly again!"
__label__1	Shitty ass service the fucking kid at the counter has such a bad attitude it's like if you hate your job that fucking much don't be there it is your job to treat customers with respect not like a little fucking punk I'm paying for your service and food if there employees can't understand we the customer keep these doors open maybe they need to be informed I will never come to this establishment
__label__1	I also got a call from Trent, he was extremely rude. Who ever is in charge of training their outbound bnb sales calls should be fired, any company that tries to get new business this way is obviously a total joke. They call from 813-563-8868, and from what I m reading they ask for someone's name to send an order to your business that was never placed. Scam company, beware.
__label__1	"Garbage check-in by Cecilia, not sure how this hotel could label itself a Ritz with that type of unfriendly welcome, didn't go over anything at check in other than hand me the keys.  There was no rush or line behind me, what a condescending attitude.  

First time a Marriott property didn't recognize or thank me for being an Ambassador in over 10 years.  600+ nights with Marriott and l won't be returning to this property."
__label__2	Dingy, dark, small bar with rude waitstaff. I drove my mother all the way here from Canada for her favorite band's concert. We don't ever go out so we ordered fancy, girly drinks - LONG before the crowd showed up, there were maybe 15 people in the bar - and we were met with sighs and eye-rolls from the bartender. Sorry to bother you by asking you to do your job while we were trying to enjoy a special night.
__label__5	It was time to order Pizza after a long day at work. There is no better place to go than Monty's Pizza.  We've been customers since 1984 when we lived a block away. So today under the social distancing measures went as expected. Friendly service, quality food meant tomatoes were ripe not anemic looking, pizza was cooked to our request..well done.  Thank you
__label__1	Ordered online. Failed to included sides, requested toppings and sauces. For which you have to pay extra. And have no real system to deliver your food curbside.  You'd think by now that restaurants would have figured it out. Not coming back. Fail.
__label__3	So I stopped in here to pick up a few things before the storm.   When it was Genuardi's (when the Genuardi family owned it), they had good pizza.   It was 4 PM and I hadn't had lunch so I got a slice.    It was absolutely the biggest slice and very reasonably priced.   The rest of the place still needs work but extra points for the pizza!
__label__2	The doctors are great but trying to get an appointment is a nightmare. They rarely answer the phone and it's not possible to leave a message. I've also tried requesting appointments online but never get anybody to email or call me back.
__label__5	"The most visited attraction in Philadelphia and for good reason.

There is a decent variety of food to be found here: French, Vietnamese, Halal, Indian and your typical American steaks and burgers.

This may exist already, but it would useful to have a map of the facility. Sometimes it's difficult to find the exact place you're looking for."
__label__2	"The sandwich was big but, was old and soggy.
I thought it would have been fresh since it was Saturday at 11 ish but it wasn't. 
I would not ever go back. It didn't taste like any of the hundreds of Cuban sandwiches I've ever had. 
If there were no other options I would eat it but, I wouldn't like it."
__label__3	My husband and I have been here a handful of times, always for breakfast or lunch. Food is usually decent but the service is what I find the major problems with. The wait staff easily becomes overwhelmed and therefore their service declines. Sometimes it's waiting to place our order, other times it's been waiting to receive our food, not receiving or being offered drink refills, or just lack of checking back in but simply put they need more staff. When they first opened this wasn't a problem however in the past year this has been what keeps us from going frequently.
__label__5	Great place and service! Amazing atmosphere; food was delicious! I recommend the sea bass with spinach or the sashimi.
__label__4	Very loud, crowded, and thus slow service. However, the hand grenades are popular for a reason. The frozen version was my favorite drink I had all week in New Orleans. It's sweet, melony, and refreshing. Plus, STRONG.
__label__1	Absolutely awful! They are unable to get a pick up order correct! When I called the manager she hung up on me! Would NOT recommend this place.
__label__1	I could go on an on about about how much my group and I disliked this place, but I'm to tired for that. This place is just bad. It's booty cheeks. I was ready to commit non-living.
__label__5	Everyone in this office is FANTASTIC! My family and I use them for home, auto, renters & business! I will never go anywhere else!
__label__3	Visiting from California and found the food and service good but a little pricey. Although our waiter was not real helpful navigating the menu, he was super friendly and did a nice job in facilitating the meal. Ordered the shrimp and grits with sausage, wood fired oysters and halibut which were all good. The banana pie not so much as we expected more of a banana pudding.
__label__4	My husband and I had a bad experience with wait time once....but since then they've done a better job.  They now serve beer which made him happy. The hibachi grill chefs do a great job of catering to children and making it fun. We enjoy family night there more than date night although date night can be fun at the sushi bar. Overall I'd recommend it.
__label__5	I recently completed a chemical peel facial session with Jen . She helped me to start a better face care routine and with the chemical peels my face looks and feels so much better.
__label__4	Great strawberry marmalade on the table, got the French toast which was good.  Small place, but they turn over tables quickly so don't be discouraged about a wait.
__label__5	The lamb kebab was one of the best dishes I've had in a long, long time. My girlfriend got the donor chicken kebab, which was ok, but that lamb kebab was amazing.
__label__2	"Unable to use them if I return at night. Wait time for a shuttle often exceeds 20 minutes. Everyone else has multiple shuttles come through before Colonial gets one. On my most recent visit they claimed I must have missed the first shuttle, but when the shuttle finally came, six others from my flight filed in as well.

Unacceptable wait times. Not worth it."
__label__4	I really enjoyed the brews here. Real well rounded favors.  I was here with some friends at a party out back and the atmosphere is nice. There's a fire pit to sit around and lots of tables and chairs and good lighting. Really comfortable feeling...it made me feel like I was hanging out at my house just relaxing with my friends. I would definitely go back.
__label__5	Dr. Hong and his staff are great! They take the time to answer any, and all questions. I know my girls (two dogs) are in good hands.
__label__4	"Hello, I just went to the Khyber Pass Pub and wanted to share my experience. I got the house burger and it was great. The selection of BBQ sauces are great, little taste of BBQ all over the US. 

I would recommend better cheese fries, the ones a had the cheese fell right off. Other than that, great experience and a must visit when in Philadelphia"
__label__1	Went there for lunch. Kitchen was ultra-slow (25 min. wait for a falafel and a fetoush salad).  When I got the food, it was bland and tasteless, and the falafel was cold. The pita bread pieces in the salad were not toasted and were soggy and frankly inedible. I will not be back.
__label__1	I made an appointment for 1:30 pm on 7/11/116 and it took them over an hr. to see me. I don't understand the technicality or process of setting up an appointment online if I have to wait over an hr. for a simple urine test. I would rate this 0 stars if I could.
__label__3	"Went with the family for a late lunch....Decided on baileys range over crown candy...burgers were tasty but small for $11...shakes were ok, not great...the atmosphere was cool but didn't seem real clean...and while the server was nice, he was inattentive and actually added a couple of items to the bill that we never ordered 
Was really hoping for a better experience"
__label__1	Waited over an hour for our food.. subpar service..water taste like tap not even filtered..food took nearly one hour and 30 minutes and they didn't even offer a cracker or toast while we waited. I had shrimp and grits..shrimp was undercooked..grits was smothered in butter..can you say cardiac arrest..only thing good was the potatoes and my so called sangria was so watered down ..huge disappointment..I'm sorry but if you see this place keep going its not worth it!
__label__4	Food was authentic. Oysters local and the strawberry ale was the best!!!! Tried the gumbo, it was ok. Tried the rabbit and duck liver pate and it's good if that's your thing. But inexpensive so it's worth trying. Great service friendly atmosphere.
__label__1	Do not get the red curry coconut noodles, they taste like absolutely nothing. Very bland. and there was like 3 pieces of tofu in it. Also the noodles weren't red.
__label__5	We love Take n Bake and have never had a negative experience with them. So much better than the Papa Murphy's down the road. Quality ingredients and always fast service!
__label__4	Great neighborhood deli in the Hill.   Atmosphere is very relaxed and staff very friendly. I had the lunch special, half house salad and half Big Jack.   The Big Jack is warm mortadella, olive relish, oil and vinegar on garlic cheese bread.  The cheese bread was phenomenal.   Definitely recommend if your looking for a delicious, decently priced sandwich.
__label__5	I've been going to these guys for about a year now for cat food, and I love them. They carry a broad array of healthy pet foods and toys--a lot of the kinds recommended by vets. The two guys who work here are friendly, knowledgeable, and laid back. They'll greet you upon entering and ask you need help but will also let you browse and wander without crowding you, as the other reviewer said. They have a program for returning customers (something like buy 10 bags of dry food get one free, etc.) which is also great for loyal shoppers.
__label__1	Absolutely terrible service...left waiting for my food because they completely forgot my order when it wasn't packed at all so was I don't recommend. Servers were rude as well
__label__3	Great location, beauitful clean atmosphere, friendly staff, The bruschetta appetizer was sooo delicious, The bread and the  squash sauce that they bring out was also very tasty.. my entrée not so much. I ordered The Gnocchi dish and it was disgusting. Tasted like cardboard box and smelled like dirty socks. My daughter in the other hand ordered the Alfredo with shrimp and her dish smelled and looked delicious, unlike mine. Over all giving it a 3 star. I'll probably will only go back if someone else really wants to go there.
__label__5	Found out about this hidden gem while I was on Facebook.  So glad that I came to try it out!  The red and green tamales are authentic and flavorful.  The chile relleno's were just like you would expect from abuela's kitchen.  I dined in and the owner was amazing!  Best service ever! They had lots of baked goods but I was just too full to try them.  I took a couple dozen tamales and 1/2 dozen relleno's to go.  I'll definitely be back!!
__label__5	Ingredients are fresh and the price is good for a heaping bowl of deliciousness. Service is also quick and friendly.
__label__5	amazing food, clean dining area, great service - what else do you need? oh and the owner Robinson is extremely helpful, exuberant, and passionate. I came for lunch and left with dinner to go.
__label__3	First let me say the staff was great! The food was just ok. We had a party of 3 so we all had different items. It was just ok. I will say the salsa and the margaritas were definitely 4 star. Everything else was not what I expected. The rice was very dry and almost undercooked. The ground beef had a weird flavor and was not very good. The grilled chicken on some of the menu items were ok. Will stick with our other go to favorites for Mexican.
__label__1	i took my dog there , he is a diabetic they charged $500 dollars and told me there is nothing wrong with him they gave him an iv and never told me he was a diabetic even though he had blood work they are the worst all they care about is money i sat there for 6 hours my dog was dehydrated 5oo hundred dollars  with no medicine if you want proof let me know.
__label__5	If you're into a chill vibe with tons of outdoor seating and great beer, you're in for a treat at BIBCO. Great staff and even better beers. They even offer half beers that let you sample more on the menu. They pour new styles every week. This is a must see in Nashville.
__label__5	Great taste, large portions, and good variety. Service is pretty quick too. We went in when it was packed and there were two parties ahead of us. We got seated within 10 minutes.
__label__4	"I love that Brothers always has such a wide selection of single slices to order. Definitely more variety than I have seen anywhere else. Get an order of garlic knots along with your pizza! 

My only complaint is the small parking lot in front of the new building."
__label__1	This place was terrible! The food was mediocre and we waited almost 2 hours for our food and then our hot food was served cold. Would give half star if I could! Definitely not worthwhile!
__label__5	Al I can say is wow. I haven't ever had my car detailed before, and it's a 10 year old car. The seats, floor, windows, dash were all cleaned to the T. I asked only for an interior detail but they went up and beyond with an exterior clean with no extra charge! You should of seen my eyes when I pulled up to see my car parked outside. They did a professional job at a great price and I recommend their service; friendly and down to earth couple. Will never forget this experience, definitely coming back again!
__label__5	I'm a fan! Have not been to one I don't like ... I like the 2 minute walk with my granny cart ... easier for a case of cheap wine lol cheese selections are fabulous staff is very nice and chattery... great place :)
__label__5	This place has original freshly made and genuinely Cuban dishes, served by great staff in a scenic dining area. I've been there twice, and can't say enough good about this one. They also clearly care about their local community, which is nice. Go there soon!
__label__5	Wow this place is amazing. Had a friend not recommended I probably would have never come here. It is a very old looking plaza. When you walk in you would never expect much from the food but boy was I blown away!  Despite the reviews the service was on point. We came with a group of 7 and our food came quickly and the server was very attentive. The pho was hearty and flavorful. I never knew I would enjoy Vietnamese food so much. Kudos to the chef for an amazing meal!!!
__label__5	"Very good pizza 
Best in chi
Will continue to order from here
Delivery very prompt and on time"
__label__5	Visited Tibbs over 4th of July weekend for a double feature.  $10 for two movies, big screens, and an awesome (and affordable) concession stand.  They have everything.  Great for family fun.
__label__5	I am so in love with this place! I've gone 3 times this week. The staff is super friendly. The portion sizes are huge! All of the fruit is fresh (I hate frozen fruit or whatever they do to fruit at smoothie places to make out of season fruit sweet). This place is legit! So happy we have this healthy option in South Tampa:)
__label__4	Had the broken rice last week, and it was so good. I also ordered vegetarian spring rolls, and my cousin and I gobbled them up! With food so delicious, and such fast service, I'll definitely come back. I hope next time to try some of their specialty drinks.
__label__5	The food is really amazing. We ordered a hummus wrap and they made  the hummus FRESH! they added garlic on my request :) Love their Chocolate cake, it's moist and has a hint of coffee. Their tomato sauce is so good I eat it straight with pita chips. Perfect place to stock up for a few days of healthy amazing tasting food or get goodies for entertaining guest. Just wish they could get a liquor license and more seating.
__label__5	Excellent fried artichoke hearts!  Great burgers. Cozy neighborhood bar. Creole New Orleans style food by locals. Give it a try. A short block from Convention Center.
__label__5	"Just had Emma cut my hair. Couldn't have been nicer. Very sweet, fast and did a great job. I highly recommend her at this location.  

And don't forget the free drink while you're waiting... Just something extra."
__label__5	Always quick and professional. Always delicious. This is one of my family's go to places when we're not up to cooking or haven't gone shopping. If I ask my kids what they want to order it is most likely going to be Panda.
__label__2	This place is good don't get me wrong but here's the problem, the service, they bring the shakes with the meal instead of bringing it prior to when the meal gets there,the walls are disgusting nothing but grime all over and consistent eyeballs from the order station but no coming over to ask if you need a drink until you call them over?? Awful.
__label__5	Out lunch today was pulled pork, smokehouse bowl, and delicious sides of sweet potato casserole and red beans and rice.   Red beans and rice was spicy but good. Sweet potato casserole yummy and meat was smoky juicy and plentiful. Definitely a must.
__label__3	"Wing stop is a favorite in our house and my daughter has been begging for boneless wings for weeks! I love 50 cent boneless on Mondays and Tuesdays so here we are. The wings are great. We never have a complaint. 
But the girl at the register tonight was not great. She kept calling me ""Hun"" despite being at least 15 years younger than me. ""Ma'am"" or ""miss"" would be much more appropriate. She also had no idea about the special for the evening. I understand training new employees but as a first point of contact, I wasn't impressed."
__label__3	It is okay if you want to dine with flies.  It was nice the first time, second not so much.
__label__1	Worse delivery service ever. Never had a problem before. I google mapped the exact location and I have found it is 5km exact... not 5.4km, you guys pick the longer route to make extra money... Prob never order from you guys again
__label__1	This place was extremely rude. The man was nice but the women there are selfish and make you feel unwelcomed. They are of no assistance in helping you find what you want. I have never posted a negative review on anyone but the experience I had there will make me never go back. They had what I needed on there website and showed no care or assistance in even wanting to help. Horrible.
__label__4	Great lunch specials!  $5 each and we left stuffed. A little too cold in the restaurant..i guess compensating for hot Tucson weather, but it was a little uncomfortable so bring a sweater!
__label__2	"Sketchy first impression, one receptionist was asleep and the other claimed she only understood French but starred at us during our meal... the food service was excellent and the quality was very good but pricey, 
Unfortunate first impression"
__label__5	Great service, from some super friendly people! Baked goods are to die for! The owner works up front and is really sweet and so helpful. The atmosphere is great and so welcoming. I love to sit with my coffee, and look out at the garden. Perfect way to spend an afternoon!!
__label__4	They have everything you need for the DIY wash. It's definitely nicer to use their tubs than trying to wrestle our dog in our tub. And there's no clean up!
__label__5	A local must go! Good food, great coffee and cozy atmosphere! Love sitting on the porch and people watching:)
__label__5	RJ and Josh are not only very knowledgeable about brewing but are also amazing at it. I had the opportunity to try 2 beers that they both brewed and they were amazing. I live in the microbrew capital that is Portland Oregon and have been to multiple brew shops, none of them carry the same amount of gear and products they do. I recommend my friends here in Portland to order off their website. Very impressed. Good job guys!
__label__5	"Why does this place not have 5/5?? I LOVE IT. Only espresso drinks? COUNT ME IN. The interior is beautiful. Their picture menu- frickin awesome.

If you're in town, go here. If you can appreciate espresso, go here. If you like cute baristas, go here.

10/10 will be returning next time I'm in town."
__label__4	"Great value. Love this place.

Great coffee and good food at very reasonable prices.

Never had any issue with service or cleanliness.

Always interesting clientele with a punky/funky atmosphere."
__label__5	This apartment complex is wonderful!  The staff are friendly as well as the residents.  There are lakes and paths throughout the complex for a walk on a nice day.  The complex has a fitness center which is always clean and never packed. Its located next to TONS of shopping and restaurants.  I always feel safe and I'm glad to call this place home.  I highly recommend this community.
__label__5	"Rocky is awesome! I couldn't find a place to inspect my car same day and happened to see Rocky's ""walk-in's welcome"" sign. He had me in and out, with an oil change and tire rotation as well! Definitely recommend and I also love that it's local."
__label__4	"Love this Greek restaurant even though I believe it is a chain.

Service was excellent and the food was outstanding.

I had a Greek Salad, the Moussaka, and Baklava for dessert. Everything was perfectly prepared.

I don't live very near to Radnor but hope to get back there soon."
__label__4	Sushi was delicious. The ginger seemed a little off putting and the soup seemed a bit darker than usual but still good. Salad with ginger was good as well. Food was prepared quickly.
__label__1	Horrible customer service. Delivered a damaged chair and are giving me the run around.
__label__4	Very similar to the Boiling Crab, same concept. The food was really good. We ordered shrimp with Cajun sauce & medium spice, and a side order or Cajun fries. The food was great and the shrimp were really big. Also, the flavor to everything was good. My grandma ordered the fish & chips and she enjoyed it. However, the food was very greasy but worth it.
__label__3	The food was pretty good, truffle-parm frites were delicious and my baked mac and cheese was on the better end of Mac and cheeses. Beer selection was decent, but the thing that made me rate so low was we waited for probably 25 minutes before a server came over and it was only after my second time asking that a manager, who was really great and helpful stopped by to take our drink order. Service was fine after, but it's frustrating to wait that long just for some water to start.
__label__3	Dairy queen ice cream is the best. However this location has the worst service. The staff is not friendly. You never get a smile. It's as if they can't be bothered to wait on you. The inside is dirty and the rest rooms are a disaster. I love dairy queen ice cream, and hope new management will take over.
__label__5	"Just came in on Wednesday! Ordered the caliente marg and 3 tacos on happy hour and everything was awesome ! 

Also my server CAMILA was literally the sweetest thing and made the best taco recommendations!


Thanks Camila , we will be coming back for you !


Music was fun and food was great !"
__label__1	Many kids have been bullied and punched here. Like other review says. Pick another camp
__label__5	Looks by Lisa was a fantastic choice. Professional, knowledgeable, and immensely skilled. I felt so beautiful on my wedding day!
__label__3	Front of the house staff is great and atmosphere is welcoming. Unfortunately, our table and those that sat down around the same time waited about an hour for  food. Even though food was discounted for the wait and apologies were extended, all components of the meal itself remained disappointing. Based on some of the other reviews, I guess we picked an off day to try the place.
__label__5	Outstanding location with great customer service and very nice dining area if you choose to eat there....highly recommend!
__label__5	"Wonderful place! Seated right away during Friday dinner service.  Awesome Paloma cocktail with stuffed squash blossoms to start! Tuna Nicoise is my go to at Katie's and it was just as delicious at Town and Country as at Rock Hill.

Server was prompt and courteous, checked on our drinks and hope everything was tasting. 

Awesome interior and artwork.  We've been for dinner and brunch, both are superb! We will be back!"
__label__3	New location in Nora and my first visit to Greiners.  From the street you wouldn't even know it was there if I hadn't noticed a banner hung against the building. I had Lucy's Pizza Steak which was good.  Confusing to order my food- Was ignored for about 5 minutes then the dude taking my order didn't even look at me just started talking.  Hopefully Mr Personality isn't representative of the place.  They deserve a second chance.
__label__1	"Quite possibly the nastiest airport bar/grill I've encountered.  Continually brushing ""sink"" flies from an expensive, dry, overcooked  burger.  Bar hasn't been wiped down in days by the looks of things - I kept sticking to it.  Beer selection is very good though, and Lauren may be able to take care of you when she's not doing 20 other tasks at the same time."
__label__5	"I never miss a chance to dine at Spasso. The food is amazing, but even better are Chef Massimo and his team! Their commitment to good, quality food and an excellent value is unsurpassed. We look forward to many more fine meals at Spasso!
As a side note, I also look forward to a time when Yelp verifies their users and quickly takes down malicious untrue reviews."
__label__5	"I have been here twice and love it.  Everything about this place is amazing: the decor, the bowling, the food (I had the Greek tacos), and the drinks.

The cost of bowling is reasonable (I think, I don't bowl too much) and the food and drinks are pretty cheap (especially for the quality of the food)."
__label__4	Great experience. Delicious alcapurrias and roast pork. No mojito was disappointing. Went back next day for more. Had the bacalaito, but couldn't eat it. Too greasy. Worth repeating: delicious alcapurrias!
__label__1	this is also my first review and I hate to repeat what all the rest have said but I also had such an awful experience (houseguests coming, waited all day, missed a seminar I was supposed to teach) that I just want to warn anyone who might buy a coupon or ever try to use their services. I never look at yelp for group coupons because they happen so quickly but i have DEFINITELY learned my lesson. I don't know yet if I will get a refund--so far I haven't heard a word back from either the company or the coupon site:(
__label__2	"Mexican food in Tampa is an enigma. It exists but it's either completely authentic "" deep in the heart of Guadalajara""  with the full on Luche Libre masks for sale or someone's version of Mexican food. Having lived in AZ for 12 years I was sadly disappointed by this place. Horchata is good but Carne Asada burritoes-not so much. I'm giving up on Mexcian food in Fl. I'll go back to Chili's."
__label__4	The food here is good. The atmosphere is sports bar-esque. You are likely to see an FX movie or some infomercial.  Check the specials. 2 for 1 hamburgers,  happy hour appetizers,  and tacos are all good on special. The new Wi-Fi finally works.
__label__5	There is nothing negative to say about Sweetie's. The staff is nice and the food is great. My husband and I like to eat at Family owned businesses; not at big chain restaurants.  Well we love this hidden gem on Frankford Ave. They cook the fish so well and sooo tasty and everything has flavor. It's a must try!
__label__4	We went to dinner here on Saturday evening and it was pretty busy, but it's a large place so there was no trouble being seated. Most of the customers were Asian and the menu is in Chinese with photos and descriptions in English. And the menu was extensive! I had a hard time narrowing down my choices and even so we ordered too much food! We got some shrimp and chive dumplings to start, then wonton soup then some spicy shrimp dumplings then roasted duck soup. Large portions and very good food. I'm looking forward to coming back to try some of the other dishes!
__label__5	"Great place. I was able to walk from my apartment.  I noticed they do have bike racks near by. 

I ordered the half curry egg salad on the spinach wrap with lentil soup. Both were excellent. I am a big fan of curry foods, it was delicious."
__label__5	In love with the live entertainment! If you are a big fan of sweet alcoholic beverages, please try the 'Catnip' drink. It's delicious! The setting was more of an older crowd and mature setting.
__label__1	This is the first subpar experience I have had at any Cheesecake Factory chain. The drinks came out after the appetizers, half the dinner guests received their entrees 25 minutes after the other half, and the waitress rolled her eyes when told the food delivered was cold. In total, there was a 75 minute wait to get our dinner. We were never given napkins or utensils, and weren't given a copy of the receipt to discuss with a hostess. What had previously been my go-to restaurant has been delegated until further notice.
__label__4	"The kabobs are AMAZING!!

This is NOT the place to go to if you're looking for a place with great decor and ambiance. You only come here for the food... and it's well worth it. 

The portions are huge and all of the meat is so flavorful. Kabobeesh is definitely worth checking out..."
__label__4	Not really being a fan of Pho (I'm definitely a ramen guy), I really enjoyed the Pho with medium rare brisket! (IIRC, the #42) I find most Pho to be overly sweet, but this was balanced nicely - a little sweet and a little salty. The portions were generous, price was reasonable and the servers were super friendly. It's no wonder the place was packed shortly after opening @11a
__label__5	Great atmosphere, delish chamomile tea, friendly staff, the largest butternut squash I've ever seen, some DJs playing ambient music, superb smells wafting in from the kitchen. The lights were a bit too low which could have been remedied with candles at each table (this would add to the relaxed vibe). The bar is absolutely gorgeous, made of smooth wood, and the espresso machine has vintage charm. The perfect place for intimate conversation, though working at night is a bit rough in the low light!
__label__4	Food is good, nothing spectacular to warrant the need to return but it is clean and stsff is friendly. I would have pictures of,my food but I was om a date and I,dont think having a photo sesh with my,plate of food would be ok haha the presentation was good. You definitely get the hang for your buck here.
__label__5	Just ate here for dinner, ordered the personal pan pizza, signature sauce, mozzarella, pepperoni and sausage. Hands down some of the best pizza in Indy. I'm a fan for deep dish and this was phenomenal. The sauce was great. The cheese was gooey and stuck to the pizza. Definitely order pizza. Or if you don't want to, the chicken fingers are pretty good.
__label__5	Best haircut and color I've had in all of Philly. Jackie is the best colorist! It was an all day affair and she was great to hang with. She really cares about the condition of your hair. In fact she probably cares more about it than I do. Hahaha!
__label__5	"My favorite restaurant ever! Boba taste really good!
Love it! Large parking lot location is perfect also!"
__label__1	Store is open However they are currently only letting 1 or 2 people at a time everyone else has to wait outside in a line! I'm not sure why they would even open the doors to let only 1-2 custom! Pretty ridiculous!
__label__1	We ordered pizza and garlic knots.  Honestly, this is the worst pizza we have ever had!  We had to take a napkin and blot the grease off the pizza.  Cook it in a skillet in order to eat it since it was so undercooked.  The garlic knots looked like someone heated them up and slipped garlic oil all over them.  Very disappointed...greasy, doughy and just disgusting!  We are done with Pizza Hut.
__label__5	The food is amazing. Full of spices and the meat was very tender. Great portions we had left overs for the next day and they were just as good. Plan to order again from them many more times
__label__4	The sushi here is crazy good. Each piece is the size of a hockey puck (not really), but a complete mouthful. I don't mind because I enjoy gorging myself with sushi. The service is good. The bathrooms are always well kept. Try the hot pepper toro appetizer if you're a sashimi lover-- I am. My only complaint is that the food is a teeny-weeny overpriced. It won't stop me from coming back though.
__label__5	Having been the Mission and different Mexican joints in NYC, I wasn't sure if Wilm would be able to deliver on its Mexican. Boy was I wrong. This place rocks and is authentic. Don't mind the gated front door and Windows. It looks like a scene from the Wire but it's legit. You will not regret. Everything is cooked with care at this family joint. You won't regret.
__label__2	We had lunch here today and this will be our last time.  Crab Rangoon's were fishy tasting, it was like they had been microwaved.  The egg rolls were flavorless and luke warm.  My chicken lo Mein was mediocre, chicken was over done. My husband spicy chicken was over cooked and lacked any spices. Our server was more interested in chatting with the host stand. Women's bathroom was filthy. I doubt we will ever go back.
__label__5	This restaurant is small and a bit hidden but definitely a treasure. I haven't had a bad meal there. I've held larger dinners on the second floor of their location and the atmosphere was private and cozy.
__label__5	Although expensive this place is worth it! The cake is incredible and the atmosphere is adorable. It's always decked out in seasonal decorations and looks like a wonderland. It's small so there's a private feel and the staff is so friendly. If getting lunch and cake is too much you can get cake by itself. I've yet to find a cake that I don't like here. Do yourself a favor and go. My only complaint is parking is a bit tricky. But so worth it!
__label__5	Michele and her team were wonderful to deal with after the loss of my mother. The arrangements were stunning, Mom would have loved them so much. They are true floral artists! Their work was stunning!!!
__label__4	"Love vintage clothing stores! This place is hard to find items but it's not hard if you take your time! 

I found bebe outfits and a pair of white true religion capris!

They have this Von Dutch bowler bag on display as decor! I would kill to buy that . Unfortunantly it's not for sale:("
__label__5	I bought a gift certificate here for my girlfriend, and she's been a regular there ever since. The service was good; the staff were friendly and it was a quick and easy way to purchase a gift.
__label__5	"Experienced cruiser and loyal to Royal. 

Royal Caribbean is the best cruise line you could possibly cruise with. They have the most accommodating ships for all ages. Varying from food, entertainment, and itineraries. Once you've cruise on a Royal ship you will be hooked! 

Their customer service team is excellent and the best I've seen in recent times. You can even ask questions directly through Facebook Messenger about your booking and have things edited or added instantly after verifying your booking with the representative!"
__label__5	Large portions. Fast service. Ramen broth is just right.. not too salty. Salmon poke bowl was delicious and I love that they have a variety of toppings.
__label__4	The Arts & Letters Cafe provides an excellent dining experience.  We went in for a brief lunch break and we were very impressed with the atmosphere of the restaurant.  It is very well known by locals as a high end eatery, and we were not disappointed.  The entrance to the restaurant goes through an art gallery with fine paintings on display, and the dining area is outside in a shaded patio area.  Everything about the environment was excellent, and the food was great.  The only thing I would be cautious about is the fact that the sandwiches are messy and the menu is limited.
__label__5	Jay is very professional and friendly! I ver recently took possession of my new home and wanted to replace all of the locks. I called in the morning (Monday morning) expecting to have to schedule an appt for later in the week. I didn't expect to be able to get an appt so soon, especially due to it being a holiday week. Jay took the call and added me to his schedule later the same day! He installed quickly, gave me some very appreciated advice, explained his work and was very pleasant to work with. A+ work and service! I highly recommend him.
__label__5	A place everyone in NOLA needs to try. A bucket list cafe in a bucket list town.  Beignets. Sweet sugary fluff pastries that are indescribably good. Enjoy!
__label__5	This California boy was spoiled AF with Pat's cheese steak !! I will be back fo sho!!
__label__1	"Buyer Beware! 
I just took the 2013 Ford Focus I purchased from Fitzgerald Auto Mall to Flammer Ford in Tarpon. There have been problems/recalls on the clutch on these cars. I asked the sales manager at Fitzgerald if there were any problems with this car and he told me no. If you are the manager your job is to know what is going on with your used cars...I will now seek out an attorney and check into the Lemon Laws."
__label__5	I am temporarily unable to walk due to an accident. I had a motorized scooter that belonged to my late father-in-law. For the first week, it worked perfectly. Then, it just stopped leaving me stranded again. Ray not only helped find the part we needed, but took the extra time to help us troubleshoot to ensure that the problem was properly assessed. He also called the manufacturer to check compatibility. Everyone was thoughtful and quite helpful!!
__label__5	"I was visiting from Houston and found Karma on Yelp. The special Acai bowls are delicious. I ordered all
3."
__label__5	I worked with Vince at Bell flooring on my new home. The variety offered at Bell is fantastic, more than I've seen in any of the big stores. They have all the latest trends and are very helpful with advice and great pricing. I love the tiles we chose here!!
__label__4	"Great little spot to grab a sandwich. My son got the Coriander and it was packed with veggies and meat. I was a little less hungry and ordered the grilled cheese and the cup of tomato soup. 

The grilled cheese was on sourdough bread and pressed neatly. The soup was creamy and delicious. 

The people were super nice.

Be aware that they only serve breakfast and lunch closing at 3:00 pm."
__label__3	"Only went to them because they had the best prices for my pets heartworm and flea pills. Anyhow they couldn't give me a definite time of when my RX would be ready. They keep saying 15 to 20 minutes, but that time had already passed. I had to ask several times of when my RX would be ready. Finally got served by a nice gentleman who seemed genuinely nice and likes his job. 

Both of these Costco's are within 2 miles of each other and aren't really convenient to get to unless you're going there already to do your Costco shopping."
__label__5	Since the moment I stepped into this place I enjoyed the product & had an amazing experience. The staff are extremely informative and honest with me about their food. Darrell, the manager is always very friendly and makes sure I am fully accommodated every time I encounter him during a visit. I absolutely love the selection on the menu. And hope that the company expand in our city so more people can experience this.
__label__1	i dont understand all the 5 star ratings ..... i went here over the summer and it wasnt anything to write home about. very average, and a little unnerving that the place had no air conditioning and it was one of those over 100 degree days in july. people sweating in or around my food ? no thanks. honestly, if you're looking for baller chinese food, hit up asuka on west chester pike on the outskirts of west chester. best chinese/japanese EVER -- check them out on yelp, not one bad review. their food is bomb.
__label__4	Good food. We have ordered hummus , kibbeh, gyros , rice. Consistently good. Also good friendly service, the place is clean and well kept. One downside , street Parking not good. Luckily we live around the corner and walk.
__label__4	Really nice place to chill have cocktails enjoy your friend or in my case my husband's company. The view was really nice and the weather was perfect . The waitress was friendly and talkative. It was a nice clean cozy spot.
__label__3	STL is blessed with a bunch of really cool little dive bars.  Pop's is no exception.  Cash only, hippie vibe, live music.  You know you are in a dive bar when there is a home refridgerator behind the bar.  I don't think they serve food, but the drinks were cold, and the service was good.
__label__1	"All workers in the store are dirty and stupid
I advise everyone not to buy anything from this restaurant They are disgusting And slow And disrespectful This place should be closed"
__label__5	"La'Gree or also known as RebeccaS on the bill was our wonderful waitress. Due to 25% occupation the restaurant created an outdoor sitting area in the back. Which was not bad. 

I noticed that they had a reduced menu but all the options looked great. My party of 2 enjoyed the Crab cakes and the Kale and Brussels Sprout Salad topped with cranberries, half tomatoes, and feta cheese. 

I look forward to going back and exploring the rest of their menu."
__label__5	As far as authentic, fast food, mexican goes this place is excellent! The tacos are delicious, light, and inexpensive. The chimichangas are also great. The bfast burrito with carna asada added is amazing and HUGE but won't leave you feeling greasy afterward. It's worth a try!
__label__5	Great!!!  The food is authentic and and very high quality! Great portion for the price. The owner was super nice and gave us a quick history on what an authentic pita is! I had the Athena with lamb and it's real lamb. My bf had the traditional With pork which was amazing too! Loved the favatokeftedes - kind of like flaffels. Crispy and great on the outside and soft on the inside.
__label__5	On new years eve we were walking on bourbon passing by drink shops selling their cardboard looking pizza and hot dog stands with $6 hotdogs we turned down this street to walk to Decatur and I spotted a man in the window cutting cheese blocks and I saw their pizza which look scrumptious and I think it was faith that we met! It was cheap and really good. I live in Metairie/ Kenner area and I think I would make that drive just for the pizza.
__label__4	Beer selection and food is excelent but the service Blows!
__label__4	It's ok Chinese food. Cheap and fast delivery. Wish fried rice was an option with entrees instead of plain white rice.
__label__2	I don't get it. I took my partner here because he was having symptoms of a heart attack.  Told them at the front desk and waited 45 minutes in the waiting room while patients with sinus problems were taken back.  Then once we got in we were advised we should go to the hospital...REALLY?!  My advise...If you have an emergency just save yourself the time and money.  Go straight to the E.R
__label__3	Stopped in with some friends after noise-level at Sly Fox was off the charts. Surprisingly, quiet there even with the placed filled. You can sit at the bar or at a table. Had their Rum and it was delicious. Good place to go after a movie or on a warm summer night.
__label__3	Pulled pork and sauces were awesome. As for the sides, I was very unimpressed--potato salad was just potatoes and mustard, Mac and cheese tasted funky, and the beans were very bland. I may go back again, could've just been a bad day for them.
__label__5	Great service!  Very professional, the manager Darren was awesome!  Recommend this to all
__label__2	Drago's at the Hilton for lunch.  I have to say the oysters are not quite up to par compared to the ones in Metairie.  They were not smoked at all.  They even didn't have that blackening look to them.  They were barely cooked and floating in way too much butter.   I would definitely not get them again at the Hilton.  We had the Creole tomatoes topped with shrimp which was quite tasty.  We also had their shrimp and corn bisque which is very good.  Service was a bit off and the place was not busy at all.
__label__5	Vegan and paleo coexist here quite comfortably. I liked them when they were on Cherokee Street, and I still like them! It's not inexpensive, but it is healthy and tasty. Vegan pancakes on Sunday :)
__label__5	"I've been going here for years now. They take the time out to cut your hair and if you don't like something they'll change it! ^_^ For girls: Wash, massage, cut, and blow-dry/style is $15. Great price! The massage is good too. And the shampoo and conditioner is specially imported from Japan and does wonders for my Asian hair.
Bad part is if you don't speak Chinese, make sure to bring a picture."
__label__5	Superb customer service. And the food - so delicious.  I'm crazy about the Veggie Baggins.  It's always so fresh and delicious.
__label__4	I use the service department for ATV and motorcycle jobs that are too much for my skillset. The service and parts teams are easy to work with and work is performed within the quoted amount (I have usually worked with Steve and Garret).  They are a bit more expensive than some of the independent shops but they have always do a great job and have the bike (or ATV) ready when I need it.
__label__4	Better than expected. Meat was well cooked, service was attentive.  Plataforma in NYC sets a high standard, and while Rodizio is no Plataforma, the tastes were good enough that I'd revisit. Reasonably priced, which can often be a bad sign. But our first visit was enjoyable. Salad bar was sufficient, even if oddly placed right by the kitchen doors. Sides were minimal, but very good. Meat was cooked well and had good flavor. Would recommend.
__label__5	This place is amazing!!! Their home cooked food is great. Sherry is the best waitress- it's like sharing a meal with a friend
__label__5	I was recommended by a friend and this was actually my 2nd time in. Katie never disappoints. The atmosphere is top notch, a must for any visitor to NOLA. The jazz band is amazing. The food is the best I've had in NOLA. I had the filet which was prepared perfect. The cocktails are amazing and the desert selection you can't beat. A MUST experience when you are New Orleans.
__label__5	"My family loves coming here! We always receive the best service and everyone is so helpful and friendly. As a Vegetarian, it is awesome to have a place to go that has a veggie burger. The ""Green"" Beyond Burger is so good! Such an awesome place to grab a quick bite to eat!"
__label__4	Good pizza, delivers to the boat! Kids loved it, so did the adults. We liked it so much we ate it a second night, we carried out, but it appeared clean and friendly for the few minutes I was in side.
__label__5	So delicious. So close to Inglewood, walk to and fro. In a great location near other great eateries. Thank you.
__label__4	Bricktops is my favorite place to eat in Nashville right now.  We have been several times with big parties of up to ten people and the service and food or always great!  We went last New Year's Eve and we plan on going this New Year's Eve and making it an annual event.  I have tried several things on the menu and they have all been great from the steaks to the fish specials on a given night.  The service has always been great and very helpful with suggestions.  Great place to take visitors.
__label__5	I brought my Harley Davidson here few months ago to have it serviced and they did an exceptional job taking care of both me and my bike. Highly recommended!
__label__5	The food was absolutely fantastic! The server was busy but super nice and it was altogether a great experience. If I am ever back in Reno I will definitely be stopping by here again!
__label__3	Our Spring Rolls were delicious. I also enjoyed my Combination Bahn Mi although it was a bit small. My wife's Vietnamese Crepe wasn't too good, but maybe it was just a poor choice. Was greasy or oily and the crepe itself had an odd flavor. All in all, it was okay.
__label__5	"Pro tip: bring cash-money.

You can't go wrong with Cheez Whiz!"
__label__5	If you like authentic Mexican food and you are obsessed with different salsas like I am, this is the place to go. There is so much variety and everything is fresh and tasty. I've been to both locations in SB and both have a great atmosphere. Los Arroyos is top 5 of my favorite restaurants in SB.
__label__5	Great Brunch spot! The menu has something for everyone which is great! We both loved our meals (lemon ricotta pancakes and squash salad). Want to go back for their sticky bun, looked amazing! Waiter was knowledgeable and very on it.
__label__5	"Came to NOLA to visit my homegirl and was in dire need of a haircut. I looked on yelp and found this spot. Even though the asian guy left a so so review, I still decided to check it out.

AMAZING! tightest lines and I look fresh to death. I wish I could take the Barber back to Cali with me!

HIGHLY RECOMMEND. I'll be coming here again when I come back to visit."
__label__2	Born and raised in Chicago and been going to Portillo's for 40 years. The Brandon location is not the same quality as Portillo's in Illinois. Italian sausage not grilled enough, sweet peppers were over done and giardiniera was much hotter than usual.  Onion rings were cold.  We love Portillo's- disappointing that the consistency didn't make it across the Florida border.
__label__3	"Depends on who helps you here. Some people are very helpful and others not so much. They do have great hours but like any other place- come in for an oil change and they try and sell me hundreds of dollars worth of things my car ""needs"""
__label__2	"You know what. I like the falafel with everything all snuggled up in their fluffy pita bread. 
 But I personally have gotten sick from eating here, friends have gotten sick from eating here, and I just got a departmental letter alerting attendees that the dept. o' health may be contacting them regarding a Hummus-catered lunchtime seminar (phew! Glad I missed that one.)  anyway, tasty but you and your insides have been warned."
__label__4	Yummy ice cream.  My son is so happy because they serve a dairy free chocolate that he loved!  Very cute mall location too.
__label__4	"Great appetizers, great service, great food...but two pasta dishes were just too salty: spaghetti with calamari and the bucatini.  The other food (pizza and cavatelli) were just right.  Not  sure what's up with the salt.

We've been here many times, and the place is finally more relaxed.  Or rather, the customers coming in are more relaxed.  Families were eating, people in shorts, old, young...More like an osteria."
__label__5	This bf place are casual, warm hawaian breakfast,and warm food so many choices that you even think about. Must visit whenever you are in Reno, NV. Make sure you are hungry when you come here. They only open until 01pm
__label__5	Best eggs benedict in town! The stuffed french toast is also delicious.
__label__3	It was good. The pho broth had a nice flavor. But no Thai Basil or sprouts to mix in. And the sandwiches are a lil pricier than my usual places. Fresh roll too. But it's good for a fix.
__label__4	"I went for brunch on Sunday. Overall, I was pleased. There was a variety of food so boredom was not possible. 

My favorite dish was the vegetable quinoa stuff and the pigs in a blanket. The mimosas and bloody Marys were scrumptious as well. And finally, our waitress was nice and attentive. 

My main issue was the cost of brunch seemed a bit exorbitant. None of the food was mind blowing, so I suppose ultimately what I was paying for was the bottomless drinks."
__label__5	They have the BEST onion rings on the beach! Would definitely recommend to all! Old Florida feel with great food and great service.
__label__1	This is the WORST chipotle I have ever been to. They have messed up my order every time, whether I place it for pick-up or delivery through Door Dash. They are completely incompetent and cannot get an order right. There are always missing items. Save yourself the trouble and support another restaurant. Never going here again.
__label__4	"Nice family run spot replacing the old grump that used to be here.  Only had the chicken parm sandwich so far, but it was enormous on delicious bread and very fresh.  

Gets a little busy due to it's small size, service is friendly and fast."
__label__5	Omg their cakes are AMAZING. You get a huuuge slice for only $6 and it tastes divine. You can't tell from the picture but it's the hugest slice of cake I've ever seen. Totally natural and light flavor with super fluffy and moist texture. Amazing!!
__label__5	Great place! Came across it acudwntly and decided to try. Crepes are fantastic.I had a savory one and a desert. Both were really yammi
__label__4	Great bento box lunch specials for $15 and $20. Live the thai chicken salad, lamb chop and sliders.
__label__1	You have to have zero taste or starving to eat here. Egg Foo Yong came out n we thought we got biscuits. There is no pork offered for moo shu so we ordered beef n we couldn't e en chew it. The shrimp tempura was over battered and greasy AND orange chicken over battered and over fried...thank god for the Blue Banana yogurt next door!
__label__4	Place always has many, many brews to choose from. Clients asked to come here, and it has been a few years...but whenever im here, i always wish it was my local pub! Cool spot.
__label__5	"Great food. Great traditional Italian atmosphere. Fried asparagus app is to die for. Great muscles, gnocchi, and the veal Bella bucca is unbelievable. Order canolis when you sit down as they always sell out.   
No reservations on weekends no cc cards.     
Order the ported chianti by the bottle and hang at the bar while u wait is the best strategy"
__label__5	Best meal I've ever had. No steak elsewhere is in the same league as the steak I had there
__label__5	"Such an amazing week at Sauler Institute!
We spent hours learning areola restorative tattooing and scar camouflage and I am feeling as motivated as ever! Mandy is such an amazing trainer and great person to be around. She made sure we were all 100% confident to take patients on our own and provided us with everything we need to be successful. I HIGHLY recommend this course for artists. 
 
Thank you Mandy, Monica, and Carla! 
What a memorable week"
__label__5	Open the evening after Hurricane Irma and their staff is happy and helpful! Food was great and I will definitely be coming back. Thanks for feeding us!
__label__1	This place is shady. The machines don't work, employees fist fight in the parking lot, and they are highly unprofessional. Go somewhere else to get a good car wash, this is not the place to go.
__label__5	I used to come here regularly but haven't been in awhile. I'm not a huge pasta person and the salad I used to get is no longer on the menu. I went this week and asked for just salmon and seasoned veggies. Everything was fresh and delicious and cooked perfectly. Waitress left plenty of bread and an oil for each of us at the table. It was a great meal and I was pleased to be able to order off menu.
__label__1	"HORRIBLE! 
No greeting when we walked in. Understood if it was a busy day for them, but the least you can do is greet and say ""we'll be right with you"". We also see you in the back not moving. Barely busy too. Probably about 8 tables left unclean. This was just disgusting, both customer service and cleanliness."
__label__5	What an pleasant surprise!  Not only was Pete the best, the entire layout of the store is inviting and fresh.
__label__4	Excellent beer, we enjoyed everything we tasted, especially the porter!! However, there was no where to sit and enjoy these delicious beers and the place was PACKED on Saturday 4/14, barely enough room to stand--we were standing between the trash cans and the kegs--not really ideal. We would look forward to coming back if the tasting room were a bit larger.
__label__5	First visit here and it was a pleasant experience for me, other than my kitty being sick. The staff is nice and very friendly to both the furbabies and the humans. Dr Mill was kind and explained what's going on with my cat and what our next steps will be. I would absolutely recommend them to anyone.
__label__5	"My new go-to for Chinese in NW Reno!

I've eaten here 4 times and it was great each time.

The lunch specials are very fairly priced for the amount of food you get (I always have leftovers!).

The potstickers are very good and the General's chicken (ask for it extra spicy) is some of the best I've had.

Well done Silver Chopsticks, you have a bright future of taking money from my wallet."
__label__4	Good place to eat. Solid food for the price, if youre  thinking youre getting all you can est sushi for 8.99$ and think its 5 star youre terribly mistaken. Its great quality for the price point. Most of these reviews are lackluster and dont deserve to post.
__label__5	We came in for the prime rib and they ran out. So wife went her second choice the ribeye, she said was cooked perfectly and was very good baked potato was very good little light on the sour cream. I had the wood fired salmon and it superb probably best piece of salmon I have had in the Midwest, standard mixed vegetables are very good and I opted for the loaded baked potato. Definitely get the drinks here good alcohol to mix drink worth the cost!
__label__5	Amazing job, they discussed the project and worked us thru all the possibilities and the final project was top notch.  We love our pool now that we can use it and not have to fish out leaves or fight the mosquitoes.  Professionals that did a great job on everything.
__label__4	Delicious bagel sandwiches.  Assortment of bagels, unique cream cheese blends and salad toppings to choose.  Order at the counter for dine in or take away.  Seems to do larger orders to go as well.
__label__4	A bit pricey for burgers,  but the people and atmosphere was great.   Sweet potatoes fries is a must.
__label__4	First time at a Pei Wei. Food was very good - Asian chopped salad, edamame hummus, and hot and sour soup (we ordered the wonton soup but they brought us hot and sour). They seemed a bit disorganized but we will go back. Food very fresh. The hummus plate was beautiful - came with beautifully sliced cucumbers, red peppers and some very thing tortilla type chips.
__label__4	This area is very nice and I am excited because I live less than 10 mins away.  This place has nice businesses and a farmer's market on Sat.  The Farmer's market is a bit stingy from what I am used too.  The only problem is that if you live here and a private person, this is not the place for you.  For me there is too much traffic and neighbors are too close for comfort.
__label__4	scallops ARE DIVINE. rich, melt in mouth delicious scallops. Tip Top Scallops cooked just right.  Calamari is also A+. Pricey and fancy though- reserved for special occasions!
__label__5	"We and our five cats are big fans of Mass Ave Animal Clinic!  They take excellent care of our little ones and treat us like friends.  They always recognize us and know our cats' names when we come in.  They are thorough and honest with their checkups and always explain which treatments and extras are required versus preferred; I never feel pressured with an up-sell.

The downtown location is very convenient, and the private parking lot is a great advantage, especially when trying to manage several carriers!  I think the prices are fair and reasonable."
__label__5	"Time and again I am enchanted by the delicious dishes that keep pulling me back to New Orleans in my dreams and it all started with the New Orleans Style BBQ Shrimp from Jacques-Imo's. Finally met the legend Jacque today after many years and plan to make the cookbook about ""The One Thing"" a reality."
__label__5	Clean, cute decoration, good environment, great and fast service, international soccer transmissions and good latin music at a very  volume, and last but not least: delicious Colombian dishes as well as Colombian products!  Loved the tostones soup !!!!!!! And they have Masato!!!! Will be back for sure!!!!
__label__2	I remember going to this sonic along time ago when the service was outstanding. I give them a 2 star because the food was honestly amazing but customer service not so great.... waited about 10 min to be greeted in drive thru until I finally said hello... cashiers need to be retrained
__label__5	Don't know what to say that hasn't already been said, the chicken, red beans and butter beans were all A-mazing! I have never had such wonderful fried chicken, oh, can't forget the homemade potato salad!
__label__4	Very good food and a clean and modern decor.  I had the mole poblano chicken, which is usually my go-to to test how good a Mexican restaurant is and it was very delicious. The menu is very affordable. Around probably $10 per person. I highly recommend this for Mexican food in the Fenton area.
__label__5	This place is worth all the hype.  It's a bit pricey but so good.  We ordered oysters and the Prime Cowboy Ribeye to share.  Everything was prepared so well.  The Ribeye was cooked to a medium rare perfectly.  Our waiter was pleasant and attentive.  Our glasses were always full.  The only downside is that you do have to make reservations in advance as it's extremely popular.
__label__5	Good service and great food. The chargrilled oysters were fantastic.
__label__5	Although it tends to encourage over consumption, if I can control myself Costco offers high quality at bargain prices.  Added to all of this is the fact that Costco's CEO supported Barack Obama for President.  He knows that when his diverse customer base is being taken care of by an effective Democratic administration his company will thrive.  Trickle up rather than trickle down.  :-)
__label__1	"Writing a review in hopes that I will get a call back for my 3 year old's hearing records. Patient Portal does not work for records (was never provided a login and can't create one manually). I've left countless messages, and if I don't receive his records by Wednesday 9/18, he will lose his spot at his school for the help he needs with hearing loss. Please contact me ASAP at 520-461-2086 / AmethystPolk@gmail.com

I will remove this review if someone can please get back to me."
__label__4	I was pleasantly surprised at the reasonable prices.  I had the salmon and it was very  cooked perfectly and flavored just right.  Decent salad.  Service was on spot, there when you want it and not lingering when you do not.  This was my second visit here.  I will definitely return and recommend for nice casual dining.
__label__2	The movers were not as careful as they should have been. One piece of furniture was damaged. Management did not follow up with us to fix the problem.
__label__5	Very impressed with Hip Maids! They were efficient and did the impossible by cleaning up a oven that I thought was a lost cause. The owner, Ed, was also great and communicative. Will be using their service again soon.
__label__5	Their house burger is the best! I've missed it soo much. I work from home due my office closing because of COVID19. I order it through ChowNow. The delivery is super quick.
__label__4	Went here for the first time today.  I got a vegetarian burrito.  For $4, I'm satisfied.  It was very spicy, which I was very happy about.  Ingredients were tasty and although the burrito was on the small size (in comparison to qdoba and places like that) it was certainly worth $4.  Next time I'll probably get guac on it for the extra dollar.  I will probably return next time Im looking for something that is a burrito and not from qdoba.
__label__4	Dont be fooled by the looks on the outside... this place is pretty good. I know Mexican food and this place is good. I come here at least once everytime i come to reno. Try it!
__label__5	Ground is a super hamburger.  If you don't like pepper, let them know up front but these hamburgers make you remember a hamburger flavor when you were a kid.
__label__5	"I would most definitely recommend this location if you need to get your windshield replaced. The staff was super friendly and helpful. On top of their friendliness they were also professional and the experience to replace the windshield was very fast and very painless and it was not very expensive. 

** I would recommend this location to get your work done!! **"
__label__5	This the best pizza in St. Louis so if your looking for some mouth watering pizza this is the place to go. I get the cheese pizza with extra cheese, true New York style with a vegan twist
__label__1	"Here I am a resident of Haddonfield, and I believe in supporting local business. Well, I and my 3 daughters will not step foot in Jay West again.  I was looking for a cocktail dress, and I was looking to spend $$.  I, however, was dismissed when they could not fulfill my dress request.  I was shown A pitiful rack of dresses without considering to show me anything else.  ""Would you like to see this, how about this?"" Nothing like that.  This store is really lacking in service.  Totally disappointing.  Your windows are beautiful, but the interior could use some more consideration."
__label__5	First time here. Came extremely hungry. It's in a nice area and is a sports bar type place. Our server was friendly and very helpful with the menu. Their menu is a QR code (contactless)  I had the chicken tenders and fries, the tavern shooter and the mozzarella balls. Food was good. Service and prices were great as well!
__label__5	Amazing Mexican food. I ordered the steak tacos and steak enchiladas. The food is great. I previously lived in Texas for 3 years so I know good Mexican and this place is good!
__label__3	OK experience. The inside decor was a pleasant surprise from the outside. It is nice that is BYOB.  We enjoyed our meals but it wasn't anything special as far as Chinese food goes. We did not try the sushi but heard that it is good there.We may return to give the sushi a try in the future.
__label__5	Thomas Webb. Phenomenal tour guide. Very knowledgable, courteous and friendly. Great showmanship and attitude. Would highly recommend this tour group, and especially mr Webb...
__label__4	I am going to try this place. New to the area and looking for a good chinese restaurant.
__label__5	I am usually a picky person regarding barbers and I have absolute no complaints about Goleta barbers, Cisco in particular. He is really good and I would recommend him to anybody experimenting with new people.  Not once have I left unsatisfied with my haircut. He takes his times cutting hair to makes sure they come out good, all the while making the experience enjoyable.
__label__5	Always on point and very friendly! Everything always taste nice and fresh! Definitely my go to spot for something refreshing
__label__5	I've been working out in gyms for well over 10 years and hit a plateau on my progress.  Sarah listened to my concerns and was able to provide me with new creative advice that changed my workout routine, and even nutritional intake. I'm already seeing progress and have Sarah's advice to thank. I'd definitely recommend her training to those looking to accelerate!
__label__4	"Truly Freaky-Fast, and they know me by name when I call...
Oooops I am a regular for sure, I can't help it! I order from here at least once a week, and I love it every time. They are always fast and in the 4 years I've been ordering I have NEVER had a problem!"
__label__5	We've used Norman Carpet for our basement, bedroom and area rug.  Dave Sulkin has a ton of knowledge about carpet and helped us with making decisions.  The selection is great and the installers were prompt and professional.  I would highly recommend.
__label__5	Amber is an amazing hair stylist. She has been doing my hair for years and I honestly can say it's always and enjoyable experience. She makes you feel like family and she is an amazing friend. I'm posting a pic of before and after she corrected my hair color. What can I say SHE MADE ME LOOK BEAUTIFUL! Great hair stylist for everything. I had to come back home from Denver just to have her do my hair.
__label__1	Ordered twice in four days. Both orders wrong. Called asked for manager employee refused both times. Never again! Food was cold employees on phone rude!
__label__1	Spent 45 minutes walking here from city. Could not find it... Asked local business owners where it was. No one knew... Thoroughly disappointed.
__label__5	Just tried Due Lune for the first time and had an amazing experience. Food was excellent, very authentic! Service was great, waiter kept checking on us to make sure we were good. Had a mojito to start, very fresh and tasty. Appetizer, ravioli and dessert were all delicious and well served. Great ambience with the best view in Santa Barbara. I definitely recommend it! Can't wait to go back!
__label__1	Cake for my daughter Chloe was lopsided with crooked text. They spelled her name Chole. I suggest Haydels or one of the many other nice bakeries in this city. 100$ and no apology.
__label__5	I tried this place last night and the food was fantastic. I am a pretty picky eater and was impressed not only by the taste of the food but the quality of the meat. They use all natural local produce and never hormones or antibiotics. The food is prepared fresh so it is not fast. If you are getting take out - save yourself some time and call ahead with the order. If your dining in they have organic wine and beer to drink while you wait.
__label__2	We thought to check this place since we were in the area but were disappointed. Starting with the chips and salsa: the chips were ok but the mild salsa was marinara sauce, which was odd for an 'authentic' Mexican place. The other salsa was not very good. Our dishes were not great. The beans tasted like they came straight from the can. The shredded chicken and beef were just ok and we really could have just not eaten it. The guacamole was watery and didn't have good flavor. The rice was horrible. Service was okay but the bathroom was clogged and not very clean.
__label__5	This is, hands down, my favorite restaurant in Nashville. The staff is friendly and helpful (they'll even give quick tutorials on how to pronounce the names of some of the dishes if you ask politely), and they have on multiple occasions suggested something new for me to try. I have never had a bad experience!!
__label__5	Yum! Nice environment - clean, modern, comfortable.   I love their Live Currant, a delicious mead made with black currants! I also am a fan of their cocktails - drinks they make using their product with various ingredients. My favorite is the Susan's Sweet Tart - South Cider + Elderflower Syrup + Rhubarb Bitters.  Fantastic! My husband likes the Mamasita Caliente, also a cocktail. We've been there several times and will definitely return!
__label__5	Great company, honest and fair.  They were prompt, and I trust them.  Expect to laugh and do little yourself but relax.
__label__5	Fabulous find! We had the gyro (pork), Greek salad with chicken, and spaghetti and meatballs. Everything was delicious and super reasonably priced.
__label__4	Great coffee house. I like their Mexican hot chocolate.  I wish they offered something to eat that was gluten free.
__label__5	Thursday night at 7...no wait!  Triple choice with chicken, meatloaf and catfish was outstanding.  Cream corn and green beans were excellent sides.  Endless biscuits with various jams are always amazing.
__label__4	My dining experience here was great. The restaurant is located in the center of Bourbon Street. I am not sure if a reservation is required. I sat at the bar and was able to order my food there. I skipped appetizers and ordered the sautéed gulf shrimp & grits. It was a nice portion and it was absolutely delicious. The shrimp were big and juicy loll. The grits were cooked perfectly and the sauce was wonderful. I have no complaints. The atmosphere here is very chill and the staff was very nice. I also think that this place is reasonably priced.
__label__5	Very nice place to relax and in joy a healthy meal. The atmosphere and hospitality is just wonderful. The food is very good, I'm a heath nut and very picky. 5 stars hands down
__label__1	"I called in an order and was told they were very busy and the wait time would be 30 minutes. ""Ok, no problem."" I said. What a mistake. I got there and waited ANOTHER 30 minutes before the food was ready, the portions were very small, and despite how 'busy' they said they were, I saw many empty tables. I went home to enjoy my meager pizza only to discover the bottom of it was burnt. Yuck! What a let down. I will never eat here again in my life!"
__label__5	Amazing! I am only in town every Christmas when visiting family and I always travel with my dog. Everyone was so nice! With proper vaccination paperwork and a quick evaluation, they let my dog stay for daycare even though we only go 1-3 times a year. And I can tell she had so much fun when I picked up her. Definitely will come back again next year!
__label__4	Great menu items, but I miss the brunch at the WC location. I understand it's hard on the kitchen. Maybe you can do a transition menu from 2:00-4:00 so the kitchen can prep for dinner. For example only serve simple food items. Just an idea. I really miss eating breakfast here.
__label__5	My daughter invited me to Rumba on Friday evening and when we got there we was sitted within 5 minutes. It was very busy but the server was on point with our refreshments, appetizer, and our meal. Coconut shrimp was delicious. Kiddos to the chef.
__label__4	Have eaten here twice, had Cuban sandwich and fish and chips. Meals were served promptly and were delicious. Prices are comparable to other restaurants in town. Excellent choice of alcoholic drinks and beers. The decor is impressive as it was formerly a bank. I will return.
__label__4	Normally I don't eat at poke bars. If everyone is eating the same kind of fish all the time, it's not sustainable. But tonight we were looking for something light, so we gave this a try. The options can be overwhelming; they seem to have options for any diet you may be on. The food, however, was very fresh and tasty. The miso soup is complimentary. The lychee-mango slushee is divine.
__label__1	Had a terrible experience on a recent Sunday night stay. I woke up on Monday to no running water. After calling the front desk, I found out that there was a note left under our door, telling us there would be no running water after 9. A note, with no phone call, notification on checkin, or knock on our door.
__label__3	"I came early in the morning at about 8:45 to get my oil changed. I knew it would be a wait on a Saturday.  I was told two or three hours and came prepared to wait.  I was finished around 11:30.
The waiting area has comfortable seating that is socially distanced"
__label__4	"Soup Dumplings are my spirit animal. 

This place is rad. 

The food is authentic and very well-made. They serve a wide selection of dim sum. 

A  good spot to bring friends in Philadelphia for a relaxed meal."
__label__5	We stopped at this corner bar before a comedy show expecting to get a.couple drinks and some apps, we were blown away by the quality of food we recieved. We ordered lobster stuffed shells, ahi, and lamb chops. The food wad so good we actually went back after the show to order oysters and another round of drinks.This is an all around amazing never heard of gem. Service, decor, food, all top notch. Like better than most top philly restaurants good. We will be back, again and again.
__label__5	"One. Word. YUMMY!!!'
This is a little gem that serves top notch food! Portions are huge and delicious! Everyone needs to try their cinnamon bun French toast... it's like nothing you've ever eaten before. Very friendly service, and the owner truly cares about everyone's experience. Whether you're a local like us, or here on vacation, give this place a try!"
__label__3	Good ribeye. Okay pulled pork. Pricey and busy. Nice that you can bring your dog and eat outside though.
__label__4	"I visited MB in July with my wife and daughter and stayed for 10 days...we eat here 3 times for dinner in that time.

Do not be put off by the frontage or decor, which are both a little dated to say the least.... visit for the really good food and great, friendly people.

Superb value, good food and friendly folks...what's not to like? Enjoy."
__label__2	The service is always good here, especially at the bar. Unfortunately when we went into the theater, our seats and tables had not been cleaned off. We arrived in the theater 10 minutes prior to the movie starting. Really disappointing start to watching the movie
__label__5	Got a full set of acrylics and a set of Classic Lashes , MiMi is AMAZING! Thanks guys definitely will be coming back. 9/10 would recommend
__label__4	Decent lunch special for around $6. Typical Chinese food but always crazy busy at lunch time so i know fresh ingredients.
__label__5	Just stopped in for a quick breakfast sandwich. Bacon and egg on a hoagie roll. Very tasty and fast friendly service! The staff there always seem to go out of their way to make sure your happy.
__label__5	Rented an entire bike for my fiance's birthday. Everyone had a blast. There's enough time to drink a beer and a half at each bar. We only wished that there were more entertainment from the 2 staff peeps. But overall, it will be a great time when you have great friends.
__label__5	WOW!! This place is AMAZING! I met some gals there for lunch and we all ordered something different, and we all LOVED everything! I had the lamb pita and the lamb was soft and juicy and perfect. The french fries are to DIE for! Perfectly seasoned and sprinkled with feta cheese. The wait staff was on top of it and the patio was really nice - beautiful artwork! I will definitely visit again soon!
__label__5	"I checked in to my storge unit today and Steve made all the difference! He was fast and efficient.  Very patient with me and helpful. He was very pleasant and exactly what we needed after moving and driving 550 miles. Easy access to the units and spaces in back to store bigger items like RVs and Boats! Someone is there 7 days a week which is nice. 
Thanks Steve for making the end of our long move easy."
__label__3	Huge and clean have good varity of food
__label__5	This is the best barbershop in New Orleans. You can't go wrong with any barber you choose here. Micah is arguably one of the best barbers in the country and he's bringing the rest of his crew right along with him. Go here. Excellent service, chill vibes, dope people, and all the recommendations you will ever need if you're visiting the city.
__label__2	"Staff is awful.  No communication and more interested in chatting amongst themselves then serving the tremendous lines they have.   One line indicates good and drinks can be ordered there but when you get to end of line, they tell you no.  Perhaps turn the sign off.

A few of us mentioned it and they simply ignore us.   

There are plenty of choices in the airport...you are best served by passing by LOVE!!"
__label__5	Love visiting this Subway.  The owners are always attentive and friendly.   The restaurant is clean and welcoming.  Food is fresh and tastes great.
__label__5	This shop always delivers, whether it's for a last-minute birthday gift, cards that say you really care, Gritty merch, jawn-centric items and jewelry. What's extra great is that they will wrap gifts, making them even more special.
__label__5	Love the manager at this store. She was so helpful and honest. I love my money and she made sure I made a good financial decision. Great to find a trustworthy staff of salesman. Happy I switched to Sprint. This store isnt concerned with just revenue but good customer service.
__label__5	The best non fast food sit-down Chinese restaurant in Sherwood Park. Their won ton soup is to die for! Their seafood dishes are fresh and delicious. Don't forget to order special tea. It isn't on the menu but they have a huge selection of Chinese tea. Be sure to ask for the Blooming tea! And Megan is the sweetest waitress you will ever meet!
__label__5	Small, Japanese owned restaurant. The food is served in plastic containers, and the overall atmosphere is very cute! My friend and I had the Don (bowl with rice and toppings), and it was the perfect portion for me. It's a place that promotes simplicity and healthy eating- pretty much as Japanese as you can get.
__label__1	I would leave a 0 if I could.  I am from out of state and had an auto loan through Hughes.  They did not have a way to pay the loan online, so I sent a check each month.  After my loan was paid off, they charged a $10 dormant fee each month to my savings account.  They refused to refund my money.  I have no doubt that they would have continued charging me after my balance was gone.  Stay away from this organization!
__label__5	I love this place! I frequent at least once per week. I don't know the lady's name that works there but she is so friendly and kind to me and my son. Delicious sushi and tacos too! Keep up the great work!
__label__1	"Nice people here, but nothing was that good.  I had a gyro, which had very little meat and chunks of tomato too big to eat.  She had a chicken salad sandwich which was too salty to eat... and some gazpacho soup which was OK.  We finished it off with some baklavah, which tasted stale and a few days old.  

For real gyros, try Pita Plus at Olive and Fee Fee."
__label__1	I wish I could leave zero stars. Stop soliciting door to door at the same houses at all hours of the day/night multiple times per month.
__label__5	"Spent the day in Philly sampling the notorious cheesesteak hot spots and pinned them against each other. First up: Chubby's vs. Dalessandro's. By far the best cheesesteak I've ever had was at Chubby's. The bread was perfect, meat was juicy, and the yellow cheese lava oozing out created an almost orgasmic ""When Harry Met Sally"" moment."
__label__1	After 20 years of going to the Medport...we will now no longer be eating there. New owners took over and are firing the waitresses and staff that have been there for many years. My husband and I, as well as our Motorcycle club have decided to find a new diner,a diner who cares about their staff.
__label__3	The food was really good. Everything I ordered tasted good and was fresh. The reason for the 3 stars was the service at the Houghton location. The staff seemed inconvenienced to help me and were overall not very friendly. Perhaps it was just an off day, but for first impressions I was not pleased with it. Like I said the food was good but the service was not, it may be awhile before we go back due to this.
__label__1	Do not go here. I went for botox and they told me I had to get my face scanned for sun damage first.  Luckily they couldn't get the machine to work. Then of course she said I needed way more units than my Groupon and tried to up sell me everything under the sun. The made me make an appointment for a follow up, I never showed up since I know the only reason for that is to try to sell more.  No thanks.
__label__5	Had a fantastic dinner!  Recommend the skirt steak and cheese platter. Our waiter, Allen, was fantastic!  Funny and there when we needed him but not obtrusive. Just perfect!
__label__5	I don't often give 5 stars, but this casual restaurant served up the best darn sandwiches I have ever tasted. OMG! I ate the South Coast Turkey and almost melted right there in my chair. Don't know how they do it, but they should be arrested for what they produce. There's no way these flavors can be legal. I'm thinking about going back to college just to hang out at this sandwich shop or at least pick up some fine looking take out. Wow!
__label__5	Excellent food with great service.  The thousand island salad dressing was extra delicious.  Scallops (grilled) were also fantastic!  Service was great, and the bread to accompany the meal was plentiful and served with garlic butter.  Outdoor dining right on the water was especially enjoyable on a summer evening.
__label__5	Great place to eat. The food is excellent and the patio is heaven. We go back every time we are in town.
__label__1	One of the staff, a large male, is not wearing a mask while providing services to a client.
__label__2	If you stay awake at night wishing Applebee's served brunch, this is the place for you.
__label__5	I ate here twice on a trip to Tampa for the Outback Bowl... The first night we had to come back later due to a hockey game crowd but it was worth coming back for!  Great sports bar scene, great service, & delicious food!  The first time I had the chicken pesto sandwich which was on special.  The second time the Asian chicken salad... I would definitely recommend if you're in downtown Tampa!
__label__5	Delicious food, great service, wonderful atmosphere. We eat here every time we are in St Pete
__label__2	"All I can really say is ""unimpressed"" big time. Menu items with ""Latin"" flavored is not my style.  service slow and inattentive. Simple things ice tea refill comes in old glass w/o ice refill. 
Last word is ""Caution ""."
__label__1	Mr. O'Leary obviously is not a professional by the way he treats his clients.  Not helping his client because the deceased and the client is gay is abhorrent to me.  No one, no one should ever use Mr. O'Leary for any type of funeral arrangements. Shame on you Mr. O'Leary for your bigoted response to someone who is grieving.  I'm sickened by your actions.
__label__1	No vegan-friendly butter or cream cheese option. I asked and she said they tried non-dairy cream cheese but wasn't that popular. I can understand that, but have you even tried a butter spread to see how that sells? The flavor is much closer and it's lasts longer. Avocado, hummus, and peanut butter are not suffice to replacement options when all a girls wants is a bagel with butter. It's 2020, this place is a joke.
__label__1	Honestly I went there because I've heard such good reviews from friends... they couldn't be any more wrong though. We ordered three dishes two came out 15 minutes before the other. And wow all three dishes must have had a whole stick of butter in them. They were just awful plain and simple. One was so over salted it was inedible. However they did feel bad about the wait time on that last dish and offered us some complimentary ice cream.
__label__4	Kept hearing about Broad Ripple on our first trip to Naptown for GenCon, but little did we know how many places there were to choose from! This little pub is super cozy with great historical decor, the food was delicious & menu choices varied still with the traditional pub choices. Beer choices weren't so impressive but I really can't complain. Service was great & next time, we will try the deep dish pizza that all other reviews have raved about!
__label__3	"Great food at a great price. The menu is supposed to be relatively healthy and the food is delicious! Employees are extremely friendly and the atmosphere is relaxing.
Definitely going to keep this in mind when I'm out in Santa Barbara."
__label__1	This place is always closed when we get here even though their website says they are open! We won't even waste our time trying again.
__label__3	I had the opportunity to eat here last night.  The atmosphere was great and waiter was nervous but professional.   However, the steak was over cook, but the lemonade was great.
__label__4	"Fun experience. The entire location is cute and have a great ambience. 
There was some wait in the morning on a sunday, but go early to put your name down then walk around the area. Great selection of southern brunch items. Staff was attentive. Would go again for the amazing biscuit and jams!"
__label__5	Came to Fazoli's tonight and had the classic baked sampler. It was delicious. Great value for the amount of food you get. The service was great also. Mrs. Terry was very nice and attentive.
__label__5	"Holly is amazing, I got my eyebrows waxed and she did such a good job. My eyebrows were crazy due to shelter in place and she brought them back to life. 
Holly was so welcoming and patient. I am really picky with letting people wax my eyebrows but I definitely will come back to Holly. 
Her energy was so welcoming and warm. 
She also does Brazilian wax's!"
__label__2	The food here is not good. Cookie cutter tourist trap near Jackson square. With all the fresh authentic cuisine in this city, a stop here is not worth your time for food. Beer is good though.
__label__3	"Seafood gumbo is very flavorful. Not very thick at all. Nice rice to soup ratio. Huge crab legs. I was impressed. 

I was disappointed because they just opened and were out of shrimp po boys already. Didn't make sense."
__label__5	Great staff and very helpful and good stock of all sports equipment. I have got golf clubs and other equipment here
__label__1	Awful product. Terrible customer service. When there was a problem with a box of tiles, it was all about what I had to do to fix the problem, not what they would do. The tile was so expensive, I really expected better service.
__label__4	Just always really good!!! Fresh fish....great service and a fun atmosphere:)
__label__1	Third visit and my last.  3 vehicles purchased at this location.  I still own 2 of the vehicles.  Never again.  Service department gets a big zero from me.  Worst experiences ever.  Not impressed with this place anymore. Lost a customer forever. No one cares no one bothers.  Stay away.
__label__5	Had a great time as always. Lee was our server and did a great job taking our order and making recommendations. Meals were great and cook time was very reasonable for a Saturday night. Despite a good amount of ambient noise, my date and I had a great experience. Can't wait to go back.
__label__1	"I used to eat here when it first opened several years ago. We ate here tonight and it was a waste of 40.00. We just had the buffet and it was awful. All the meats were dry and overlooked. The only ""salad"" was chunks of lettuce with the thick spine in it. No leaves without the spine. And nothing else to go in it. The choice of salad dressing was ranch or thousand island with a dried layer on top. I barely ate anything. We won't be back."
__label__5	"Dont expect over the top Cajun cream sauce cuisine at this neighborhood hangout. 
You won't get fat but your taste buds will thank you for dropping by, as will your billfold. 
I dropped in on a lazy sat afternoon and had a delicious bowl of chicken tortilla soup. 
If you're burnt out on Po boys and étouffée give this one a try."
__label__5	My favorite coffee shop when I travel to Philly.  Very tasty espresso, perfect cappuccinos.  When I have nothing to do, I often walk from my hotel on Society Hill to this location on nice days.  Their beans are also what are served at my favorite bagel place back home outside DC, but its not quite done as well as here in Philly.
__label__5	Good and happy crew! Love it! Clean environment clean bathrooms with toilet seat covers, seems to be not a standard in Florida. Wonderful idea to serve wine and beer! Down the street from our stay!
__label__5	Came in for the first time. Great, open floor plan with inviting and friendly hosts. Was promptly seated at the sushi bar and offered water while I wait for my waiter. Justin took great care of my needs and answered any questions I had. They offer great vegan and vegetarian options and a happy hour daily. I'll be returning again. Thanks Justin (:
__label__5	Just got my eyebrows threaded at Glitzy Brows located in the strip-mall of Oakwood Commons in Hermitage by Almah(I think she is the owner along with her husband). My eyebrows look great and it was only $10!! She also gave me a card to have stamped every time I come. It gives you, your 6th visit free!! Make sure to see Almah and Thanks for the great customer service!!
__label__5	I really liked the Malai Kofta! They can also make it as spicy as you request on Seamless. Their lunch buffet is really good, clean, but the food is milder.
__label__5	Purity is the best choice if you follow their advice.  It is a lifestyle change requiring commitment but the benefits are impressive.  I went for metabolic issues.   Almost immediately my allergies improved to the point that I haven't used antihistamines or decongestants for a year, a bonus that I hadn't discussed or expected.  Go there first for primary care that is more comprehensive than you commonly get elsewhere.
__label__1	I ordered oatmeal but I got this.   I am definitely not loving it. McDonald's, you have one job...
__label__3	Good live music and now smoke free!
__label__5	Loved this little pop-in shop. Standing room only - no seats, yet still feels like you can take your time and grab your cup a joe for the morning or afternoon. Cory made me a killer americano and provided awesome conversation. The owners care about their customers and community - kind of a rare find nowadays :)
__label__1	We ordered a delivery of waffles, sausage balls and my daughter ordered a biscuit sandwich. My waffle was soggy and placid. Took one bite and threw the rest away. Her sandwich was covered with so much gravy you couldn't taste anything but the gravy. So we paid $30 for food we threw away. So frustrating.
__label__4	Good. Weirdest bowling alley I've ever been to. The seats... well have you ever sat on pointy rocks? Because it's nothing like that
__label__1	Disappointed...Kuhn Honda uses them for window tint. With my new accord purchase I was sent there to have tint put in with my package deal...well this morning I am wiping and cleaning all the drips and streaks off my new black seats, doors, and headrestsfor over 30 min. Even found a few pieces of the tint when wiping the back window area. I see this as unprofessional and a hurry job. My car is brand new, I should have got it back the way I brought it in CLEAN!!!!
__label__4	Very good restaurant and ambiance; server was deficient but manager jumped in and filled the void, my compliments.
__label__5	Wonderful place! As someone from the northeastern part of the country, I grew up eating at classic style Italian bistros - discovered Pia's while vacationing in Florida and was extremely happy to get a taste of those old school bistros in the lovely town of Gulfport. Great appetizers, friendly and attentive service, and a wonderful base gravy (sauce). Highly recommended.
__label__5	"This is where God gets his burgers.  ...and his black & white milkshakes.  Some people don't ""get"" this place.  I feel so sorry for them.

This is my shortest Yelp review ever, because there is nothing more to say.

If you see God while you're there, tell him I said ""Hi""..."
__label__5	The staff and owner of Indulgence are excellent! They are attentaive to your needs, they are a very full service salon, nails, eyelashes and brows. They have a huge selection of nail colors and absolutely do the BEST SNS nails. Indulgence beats their competition hands and toes down!!
__label__1	Dr. Rachel Williams totally misdiagnosed my cat's condition, stating he had a fracture of the calcaneus and tarsal tibia.  Only one x-ray was taken and there was no radiologist at the clinic to interpret the film correctly.  Apparently Dr. Williams has limited knowledge regarding feline anatomy.  I then took kitty to a professional clinic with experienced veterinarians AND a radiologist and learned he had a broken pelvis.  I do not recommend this pseudo urgent care clinic.
__label__5	Not sure why people hate this place but I love it. The staff is extremely knowledgeable as long as you make an appointment things usually go smoothly. Best of all the only thing they charge for is hardware repairs. FREE tech support. FREE software assistance. One of the most common needs of apple users is reinstalling Operating system. Can be pretty straight forward but sometimes complications arise. The apple store provides this service for FREE and I have taken advantage of it many times.
__label__5	Food was great, absolutely loved my puppy had his own menu. Looked like a spot for the locals, but those are the best spots for travelers to eat at. Will definitely go back whenever I visit Santa Barbara again
__label__3	Upland is an awesome brewery! Great layout and patio that is super dog friendly! Food and beer is good but unfortunately you'll never really get good or fast service here. It just seems like they are always slightly understaffed for some reason.
__label__5	5 star service 5 star food. Love it here! Hey open one up in NYC! And this rock shrimp is the best!
__label__5	This is one of my favorite restaurants. It's a little pricy but it's well worth it. The food is always good and usually amazing. The tastes are well balanced for each plate. The rotating beers are good. Some are better than others. They are all better than bottled brands.
__label__5	These folks consistently do a fabulous job cleaning carpet at my house as well as my elderly parents' house. Plus, they're lovely to work with and have a real mentality of making everything as clean as possible. I highly recommend!
__label__1	"I dont kno how Reno does its Vietnamese but if this place is it, they ain't doing it right. 
The chicken was literally shredded from a whole chicken and warmed up in a microwave. So disgusting. Everyone's food sucked at my table. 
I love Vietnamese food and eat it hella times a week. If this was my only option I would stop eating it all together. 
Oh and their boba was like 200 years old. 
So gross!!!"
__label__3	"I have always enjoyed my meal here (meatloaf, staff meals, tuna, lunch sandwiches, corned beef hash) BUT I think the food is way overpriced. Spent $20 on staff meal that was 90% noodles and 10% meat that they prob needed to push that night. Was disappointment when staff meals in the past had fish, more veggies, more bang for your buck. 

Also, the condensation from your water on their ""rustic"" coasters makes the ink on the coaster bleed. Dripped on my dress and stained it."
__label__1	They seem they hate their job. Old man talked me very firmly not friendly at all. I'm not gonna go there again. Good luck!!
__label__5	High quality to-go, delivery & catering. Everything is outstanding. Have had their food many times & it's always delish. And they deliver! They have my highest recommendation.
__label__5	I had dinner there this evening. The food was delicious , the server was friendly and polite, the hostess was charming. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for great food  and nice ambiance...Oh and they do play great music.
__label__4	Me and my wife are new to the Wilmington area and we recently stepped out to try the local restaurants. As usual, we looked up Yelp and the oyester house showed up. As we enter, first thing we notice was the young crowd and live music. The food was was not too shabby either, we ordered seafood stew, fish tacos and blackened mahi mahi. Everything was fresh and seasoned perfectly. We are already planning out next visit to try out the oyester shooters!!
__label__5	Always pleased. Main courses & sides are full of flavor with a homemade touch! Consistent quality & deserts are through-the-roof!
__label__5	OMG! Doug (owner) and Missy were EXTREMELY knowledgeable about appliances and could answer any question. I did my homework with all appliance stores in the area and hands down, I can't understand why anyone would go anywhere else.
__label__4	I frequent this truck whenever they're around. The BeachBall (crabcakes) over the dill slaw is TO DIE FOR!! Only once did I get a mushy meatball & it was the teriyaki or brown sauce one & it was only once. This kid works hard & the meatballs & fries are superb.
__label__5	"All and all, this was a good experience. We ended up eating here after our bad experience at Vegan Wit a Twist. The staff was beyond helpful in ensuring that my wife got a gluten free meal along with them also being one hundred percent vegan. She enjoyed her meal and latte, and we even got gluten free brownies to take home.

I'd definitely recommend this place as a good spot to find a satisfying vegan and gluten free breakfast or lunch."
__label__5	I have my install done by Jeff...I looked for this man for 2 years, only to find him in the same spot I left him but under a different salon name.  I am so glad I took the time to look for and find him...He is my Weave Guru.  Anytime another stylist can compliment your hair, speaks volumes about the kind of work that he does.  Thanks Jeff for always making me feel beautiful when I leave your chair.
__label__4	Yep I still love Tijuana Flats, we still go often. I just wanted to update to say I just learned you can order only 1 taco! This is awesome news because I always found the 2 tacos to be way to much food. Their tacos are ginormous. 1 taco still comes with a side of chips and now my husband and I can eat dinner here for around $10 both leaving plenty full. I think you can see why we go so often.
__label__5	"Love this place. The best ice cream there is.
All flavors are really delicious. However my all time favorite is Chocolate Thunder."
__label__5	My husband and i have eaten here a few times and whether we spend $10 or $50, the service is always amazing and the food is always delicious.  I was thinking the prices may have gone up a little, but we always get our money's worth.
__label__5	Had them for years now. Back when they were chestco or some other name I honestly forget. But they have always been fabulous. Plus the best price you can find in this area!!
__label__4	"The carne asada is the best in town. 
The prices are stellar and the service is quick. 
Parking SUCKS though."
__label__4	The place was packed considering COVID. Not enough tortillas for the fajitas but it was a ton of meat and the steak was tender.
__label__5	Great service! The food is fresh and always tasty I love  the shredded beef tacos with the spicy salsa. Rice is good churros are made fresh.
__label__5	Cool vibe, authentic food. The entire family loves this little gem. Try it out for sure. It's not your chain Mexican restaurant but you won't be disappointed by that at all. Enjoy!
__label__2	It was ok. Service was extremely slow. All of the burgers we ordered were over cooked. We ordered 5 medium burgers and they were all well done. One came out with the wrong cheese and it literally took about 10 minutes to get it corrected. Wagyu beef advertised, but it was nothing more than regular old ground beef. Great atmosphere and nice people but not really worth the price on my opinion. A better place for some beers and pool
__label__4	Walked right in at lunch time. The food was very good (mozzarella, tomato, basil sandwich and baby greens salad). The prices were very reasonable ($21 for two lunches and 2 sodas). The staff was overly helpful. The parking garage is free. I can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu.
__label__5	Took level1 class last night and returned this morning for bag class, I loved it!  I should of listened to my wife a long time ago and joined when she did, but now I'm a member and can start my journey with the Krav Maga family! My biggest takeaway is everyone is is very kind and respectful in the classes which is really important and the workouts are challenging and you actually learn something that can save your life...
__label__4	The tacos and salsas are AMAZING. I wish the margaritas were just as great. The margaritas are so tart and taste like straight up lemon juice :/
__label__5	Absolutley the best custom cakes in the New Orleans area! My wife just retired from the Marines and I wanted a custom cake to fit the occasion. I spoke with Monique and described what we were thinking. She provided a sketch which we made small changes to and when the finished product was presented, she had exceeded our expectations. The cake was awesome and tasted just as good as it looked. Highly recommend Pure Cake for your retirement, wedding, birthday, etc...
__label__5	Tennessee whiskey tasting were a good choice after the beer tasting at yazoo. Really enjoyed the wings.
__label__5	Excellent high-end hostel! Very pleased with the staff, charming private rooms, perfect size, the feel of a boutique hotel with all the right amenities ! Very modern/boho/Eco feel to it!  Cannot say enough great things about it! We enjoyed our stay very much and will be coming back, it has officially become our home away from home!
__label__4	"My first visit I Tried the breakfast sandwiches because of all the good reviews.. Yum!  

My last visit was at lunch time.. It is a great alternative to Ybor and dealing with parking just to grab a sandwich!  I had a pressed ham and cheese and it was very good. And a great price.."
__label__5	I love this place!  Best guacamole in town!!  It is also the most authentic Mexican food you can get in the area!  Don't let the location fool you!
__label__5	Was pleasantly surprised considering there arent very many restaurants in the Wilmington area that impressed me. Everything we ordered was delicious, from the guac and chips to the shrimp tacos, steak tacos and tres leches cake. We got onion rings and corn on the cob as sides and both were also amazing.
__label__1	Terrible service, we sat down and no waited on us for ten minutes. No one greeted us, we were completely ignored. We just walked and drove to Ihop. I don't think we'll ever go back to Waffle House.
__label__1	Would have given this hotel a 5. However. My family which includes 2 children under 12 and my mother who is 70. We are just hanging out as a normal family would. We get a knock on our door. A staff member tells us there was a complaint for noise and that we have to remember we have neighbors. Yes a family is loud. Never will I stay here or a Hilton again. a family watch the food network eating room service. Yicks. Watch out bad news. The hotel should have been a bit more concerning with complaints
__label__1	"We were refused a reservation for 8 this eevening because ""the gem show outoftowners would get mad with the manager"". We have been regular customers for at least a year & find this neglect of regular customers unacceptable. When told we secured reservations  from another Indian restaurant we used to frequent received the flippant message ""enjoy"". We will."
__label__4	from the ice cream and other stuff in this shopping center from the medford bagel shop to buffalo king daddy O's ranks ok in my books yeah it's pricey but compared to some other frozen yogurt places it's understandable
__label__5	I had gone by many times since I moved here 3 months back and finally took the time to stop.  Glad I did.  What  great little place.  There were so many treats I had a hard time choosing. I did choose the Double Chocolate Ganache  Brownies and the crumb cake.  The crumb cake made it to the house...the brownies did not.  I will be going back.  Steven was so welcoming and I love supporting small business.  Tomorrow...the Biscotti and maybe some toffee cake.
__label__5	The food is incredible, with every bite it pops with flavor!! Loved the atmosphere and live music.
__label__4	Yum, sweet spot for ice cream! The kids are comfortable, staff is friendly. It really is delicious. Unique flavors too! I like to go as a special treat.
__label__4	I had my car detailed here several weeks ago and was thoroughly impressed with the results. I looked at several places in the Marlton/Mount Laurel area and ended up choosing this location. Needless to say I was very satisfied with my decision. The attention to detail was bar none, car looked like brand new. Highly recommend this place.
__label__3	The food was not great. The Mac and Cheese was horrible! The Prime Rib sandwich nothing to rave about. The Shrimp and Ginger, Avocado wrap was good and hi light of menu. I spent $40 bucks for a $16.00 meal and that's being kind.
__label__4	Some may say that the sandwiches here are expensive, and I agree that $8.75 may be a little high, but when you taste one and realize the quality of what is inside, excellent meat ,cheese, roll etc., you will leave feeling that it was worth every cent. I love the tomato sauce very plain nothing fancy but very good.
__label__2	"Getting better, but its still more a novelty than good sushi
Everything ordered off the menus is excellent,  but thats not the point of this place.  If inwanted tonget great sushi off a menu inwould have gone to sushi cortato"
__label__1	There is something wrong with you if you like or go here. You're either a tourist or have questionable character. Pat's is across the street just go there or any of the 100 steak places including food carts that are significantly better. Don't be fooled by the bright lights or the BS publicity it gets on the nation stage, its plain gross.
__label__5	The service is good and the food is always fresh. One of my favorite local sushi places.
__label__5	"I really loved the hand made noodle soup. Great portion size, friendly staff and tasty food. 

Cute little train delivers the food to the table too."
__label__3	Not horrible, but not worth the wait or price. Meh. On future visits we won't come here.
__label__5	I have been going to Carl's since I was a little girl and it's the best burger in STL. Look, you don't go here for friendly service. The ladies working there get to the point. I can't stand reading these reviews complaining about poor service. Stop being so damn sensitive, people !
__label__2	The fish entrees that we ordered were all good.  The service was poor.  Maybe it was a new server;  maybe they really always serve the table as the food is ready,  and not at once as a practice?  Never seen it before.  The tapas menu seemed overpriced.
__label__4	We stayed here a few weeks ago and really enjoyed our stay.  We were welcomed with nice warm cookies and bottles of water. The room was very nice and clean.  The hotel was in a great spot near restaurants and other venues. The only reason I didn't rate it a 5 was because of the parking being so inconvenient and expensive.
__label__5	We highly recommend this restaurant.  The line was long for drive-thru. However, they are so organized the line went really fast. That was really nice. But, then the food was great and prepared correctly. We will be back next time we are in town.  Great value.
__label__5	This place is good! Cheap and a good place to chow down really quick. Could barely finish my bento box. Milk tea was delicious toon
__label__5	Im happy that I found Apryl  through Yelp because she is amazing, nice, very informative and knowledgeable! She explained every step of the process and gladly answered all my questions. Her spa is very clean and fancy .
__label__1	I ordered the baby back ribs and what I got was a chunk of meat mixed with fat. There were barely discernible rib bones. I think it must have been the end pieces of two different racks. When I picked up my order, it was confirmed that I ordered the baby backs, but what I got looked nothing like any baby back ribs I had ever seen. My order was quite pricey-18.00 for 1/2 rack plus two very small sides. I would not recommend to anyone their ribs. Next time I will go to Chilis.
__label__1	They made no effort.  My sandwich had almost no meat in it.   It was a turkeyless turkey sandwich.  Blah isn't even the word.
__label__5	I used to hate going to the dentist, but the staff at Barrington Dental cures me of that. The entire staff is caring and friendly. If you are looking for a new dentist, I recommend them.
__label__3	My Veggie Delight eggs Benedict was tasty, but the service was rather slow. The homemade crepe is delicious, I'm interested in how a sweet one would be. The waitress was also sort of flighty, but she did own up to that. Overall, not a bad breakfast spot.
__label__2	This ER is frigid and the wait is long.   Be sure to bring a heavy jacket or blanket.  They don't offer one.  My 86 yo mother waited for 4 hours in the frigid conditions to go back to a bed and how she has an upper respiratory infection on top of the issue for which she was seen!
__label__4	"I have been half a dozen times for lunch and never had a bad meal. Grilled shrimp tacos and shrimp salad very good with lots of shrimp. Excellent fish fry today with again large portion. Always found very friendly staff. Will keep coming back.

Steve G"
__label__3	I an not overly impressed here.  The ten dollar per day room fee is annoying.  A ceiling tile fell in the bathroom while I was in there and to repair it they just put the same tile right back up.  We didn't get washcloths replaced in our towels one day.   Everyone was very pleasant and friendly, though.
__label__1	Cheryl's herbs appears to be going out of business. The shelves were nearly empty. Either that or they've just resorted to gouging customers by only selling the tiniest size of essential oils at trumped up prices.
__label__3	The atmosphere was nice and I love that they close at 10. The food was ok, salsa and chips very good.
__label__5	Exceptional customer service and fair prices. I've never had anything but wonderful experiences with this place. I highly recommend them for great service, friendly staff, and their timeliness in servicing the vehicles.
__label__4	Nice place. Music was a little loud for me, but they do a good job. My only complaint is that my nail technician was a little rough and cut me. The massage was great though. I would go back.
__label__2	You won't be happy if you get Kim! She is unfriendly and rough!! It's supposed to be a pleasant experience but I was in pain and treated rudely most of my pedicure.
__label__5	My wife and I stopped in for dinner and drinks and loved it. We sat outside on the beach, which was awesome, and had a great time. The namesake drink is excellent, our waiter Austin was fantastic, and our meals were great (chicken nacho appetizers, dutch burger and medianoche sandwich, and a slice of key lime pie ti share). Can't wait to come back!
__label__4	My server was good, young , not enthusiastic, forgot a lot of things but had a positive attitude. It's a chain so my expectations aren't high. Was my food hot was it good  yes , did I feel my margarita, yes, could I have made it better myself, yes,  but did it curb my craving for seafood without me cooking, yes!! Yes sometimes it's hit or miss but i enjoyed my time.
__label__2	If you're looking for average Indian cuisine in a below average decor with below average service, were satisfied with C- grades in school, this is the perfect place for you! First try for good Indian food in this area, will try again elsewhere.
__label__4	"Good donut, I tried the strawberry lavender and it was a tasty, soft cake donut with sugar sprinkled all around. I couldn't really tell the flavor since it tasted like a normal sugar donut but at least it was a good cake donut texture.

Also tried the chicken sandwich, good big piece of chicken with some pickle slices inbetween the buns. However, nothing special about it. Stick to the donuts."
__label__3	Been here twice. Both times for 35 cent wings. They are always overcooked but worth the price. Good beer. Good service.  Oh...I look forward watching Oilers here. One thing this bar doesn't lack is tvs.  Look forward to eating cheap wings while watching McDavid.
__label__4	Nice and friendly staff. Very good hotel for a 3-star hotel. The two bed room we booked was nice and clean. Garden inside the hotel was beautiful and well taken care of. Quite and calm atmosphere. Great breakfast options and food. Would definitely come here again!
__label__5	Was in town for the weekend visiting my parents and was told by my friends to go check out this patio. Amazingly impressive! Had such a good experience and the service was fantastic. Both bartenders absolutely kept the vibe alive and my family and I could not help but order another round and an Uber following it LOL. The food was okay, but the pulled pork was the bomb, and the view was awesome. Sunset is a gem here, but the highlight of the evening by far was the service and the hospitality of the bar staff.
__label__1	I got a pair of New Balance at DSW at a good price. I wore them off and on for about 4 months and notice a bad squeaking (i am hard of hearing) that a friend pointed out to me. Apparently it was very bad and it disrupts people as i walk. When i tried to return them even though everyone agreed they are extremely disruptive they would not take them back because its been too long. Now I wear them and people make fun of me. Not happy with DSW!
__label__4	I really enjoy a Starbucks coffee so I try to stop whenever I can. I do not like the shops located inside another store since many of them don't take the pre-filled cards. This was the only one i the area we were visiting so I had to stop and get my Latte. The service was OK.
__label__4	Wonderful, fresh food. Only complaint is not always having the ingredients to make what you ask for, but understandable in winter.
__label__4	Great service....excellent food! The fish cake they bring to the table is awesome! Little on the pricey side
__label__5	Was in town for Thanksgiving and last minute decided to dye my hair! Nicole did an amazing job matching my the color to my roots! She was so nice and does a great job at coloring, cutting, and styling hair! She is also quite informative on how to take care of your hair after it's colored! Would definitely recommend scheduling an appointment with Hair by Nicole for your next cut and color!
__label__4	Service was quick!! Food was decent. Highly recommend the She Crab Soup!! It's a popular restaurant but surprisingly, we got in right away.
__label__5	Michael and the team at Tire Pros are stellar and cannot be thanked enough for the incredible service and help they provided. After driving from SF, and suspecting I had a tire issue, Michael found a nail the size of a small sword in my tire, and got to work immediately. They removed and patched my tire, carefully inspected all of my other tires, and provided me the peace of mind I needed to continue my trip to LA safely. I feel lucky to have stumbled upon them, and would recommend them to anyone in the area or traveling. Thanks again, and keep up the awesome work/service!!
__label__4	Been here twice with a group--both times we had great service (the owner was very attentive!) and the food was HEAVENLY. Really interesting, tasty dishes all around--from starters, to entrees, to desserts. Definitely try the cornmeal flatbread!
__label__5	Gumbo hit the spot really good. The she crab soup was also great. The fried shrimp po boy was just as good.  Very pleased with this place.  The service was excellent. Saw this place on diners drive ins and dives had to try it. Thanks Guy.
__label__5	"Great class with new teacher. Her first Hot 26. It is great to come into town and find a studio that sticks to the true Bikram series. I want to stay that I am not a fan of Bikram himself but staying true to the series is important to me. I have been doing this series for over 15 years and it has had many healing effects on my body mind and soul. I am glad the Hot 26 is not ""franchised"" anymore but I hope studios that use it will stay true to the series."
__label__1	"So apparently to gouge the ""happy hour customers"" looking for an inexpensive snack after imbibing, they change their menu after 7:00 on Friday nights to only ""pretzel twists"" which they charge $2.00 apiece!!!  What a scam."
__label__4	This place was so cute. I had brunch on a Sunday here, so I made sure to make a reservation. The weather wasn't that warm, so we opted to eat inside although the courtyard outside looked pretty magical. I had the muffuletta sandwich, which was pretty delicious. The olive spread on it gave it a unique taste.  The others with me had more breakfast related food, which they both enjoyed as well. The coffee was also pretty good according to my friends. Wish I could come back to New Orleans more often.
__label__2	Food is way overpriced. Nothing original, new, or exciting. My escarole salad was drenched in Caesar dressing and wilted. Wild boar gnocchi was salty, wild boar was scorched. If you're looking for good Italian, stick with bridgids.
__label__5	Excellent stay- very comfortable bed. Modern, clean bathroom. Some street noise but it was after all a Saturday night. Kind and helpful staff. Good food all around. Great location.
__label__2	Great atmosphere. Plenty of space. Not enough food for the price. Everything tasted good.
__label__1	"Anyone thinking this is actual  ""history"" needs their head examined, instead, expect an ode to the past days when white men could inflict terrible damage to the natural surrounding of Arizona incl wiping out native settlements in the quest for greed.  Inside you'll find white washed history, no mention of indigenous people, except to state that they were ""blood thirsty savages who attacked mail routes"", memorials & other trinket memorabilia devoted to an idiotic past.  

Reminds me of a warped museum for the dumb crowds.

It's fun if you are under 12 though, has a nice dark cave inside."
__label__5	This is probably the best Mexican restaurant we've been to! We ordered the bacon guacamole and it was amazing!! Best guacamole I've ever had. The fajitas and spare ribs were spot on and the house margarita was delicious! The kids menu is even good as my toddler ate a good bit and she's a picky restaurant eater. We will definitively be back!
__label__5	"Great beer, great mussels, great frites.  

Whenever my buddies and I visit, we always find something new to try out, we always have our fill of great food, and we always have a great time.  

The upstairs seating area is far more comfortable for hanging out."
__label__1	Horrific Service. Less than mediocre food. Bad experience tonight when my husband ordered. Will never order from this place again. We ordered from them only because they are open later than other pizza places in the area but will NEVER make this mistake again. Our food took over an hour to be delivered and the mega fries came with one layer of mozzarella cheese (fries on the bottom of container had no cheese on them) and there was one small blob of cheese wiz slapped on them. Very disappointing! There is WAY too much competition in this area to ever bother ordering from here again.
__label__5	Huge menu so tough to make a decision. Settled on Maria's Greek Skillet and Meat Skillet (subbed gravy for hollandaise). Both were huge portions and delicious. They were super busy, but the service was really good. Plus... had to have a half price mimosa! (All day every day)
__label__5	Such good food and really nice staff! Good dessert too. Cozy environment. Definitely worth going to!
__label__1	DONT VALET PARK YOUR CAR WITH PATRIOT PARKING -THEY DAMAGE AND DENY LIABILITY AND RESPONSIBILITY!  Stayed at Hampton Inn PHILI CONVENTIONS Center and valet parked car.  Car bumper was damaged causing a $600 repair, and they denied they damaged auto and would not cover repair.   Also they park car three blocks away from hotel.  Spoke to manager of lot Ammar and he said he would ask attendants if anyone did damage.  Really!?  Are they going to volunteer and lose their job?  What great management!!! Will never park with them or stay at the Hampton Inn!
__label__5	Great for a Monday date night. The place is quiet, romantic, and bottles are half off.
__label__5	I've gotten my lashes done before by someone else and they were nothing compared to the way SERENA does my lashes. She's professional & talented at what she does! Lashes always look on point!! Lol I won't go to anyone else. Thanks
__label__5	"Really great restaurant w safety precautions in place. Friendly staff. Sat outside socially distanced. 
Enjoyed steak fajitas and chips and salsa. The sangria was tasty and strong! 
Highly recommend."
__label__4	"I think Avis is reading the Yelp reviews over the last few months. I did not have nearly the experience these other people had experienced. 
The shuttle came within about 5 minutes of me getting to the bus stop. 
As a preferred member my name was on the board, the car was in the designated spot. The car was clean. 
The exit was a little slow due to the fact that there was only one person helping cars exit. 
The drop off was really easy, quick and the associate was very nice and friendly."
__label__5	Such a great experience! Scott took us to such amazing wineries and really personalized the trip. Would highly recommend.
__label__2	Skip this place and pay the extra $4.00 somewhere else.  The food selection is minimal and the food is bland.  The older gentlemen that is the floor supervisor on Sunday nights can care less about customer service.
__label__5	Awesome sushi. The Sashimi was very fresh. Try the Godzilla roll. Great food at reasonable prices. Good wine selection as well as a full bar. A little tricky to find as its on the second floor of a small shopping ares but well worth it.
__label__5	"Don't even question your decision to try this place. It's amazing and the flavors are awesome. 


I got the bacio it was exquisite. Rich, chocolate and hazelnut with a velvety texture. Perfect. 

My friend got the dulce the leche. It was decent but it didn't have enough Carmel so it tasted plain very quickly. I'd skip it next time."
__label__5	The $2 per car entrance fee makes this park a win for viewing wildlife. We saw a huge variety of birds including anhinga, heron, egret, ibis, among others. The volunteer staff at the visitor center are quite knowledgeable. Take a picnic and hike the boardwalk. You can also rent canoes to paddle on the lake. There is lots of shade from the hot sun.
__label__5	I was surprised walking by and finding a traditional pizza place. As a New Yorker, this place meet and completely exceeded my expectations. Mouth watering flavor and giant slices, what more can you ask for. Excellent!
__label__5	I've never tried Greek food and this place definitely made trying it for the first time amazing. Everything was made fresh. Nice worker ! The food didn't even last because I enjoyed it so much !!
__label__5	What a delicious and filling breakfast! Such a cute spot right across from the beach. That was the best omelette and fruit display I've ever had. Highly recommend this spot for great food and service. Definitely go.
__label__1	You better walk in expecting you are going to pay an arm and a leg for this rip off that they call ice cream. I paid $6.50 for 3 HALF SCOOPS of ice cream...never again. On top of this, the ice cream was really nothing to be impressed by. The Salty Caramel might as well have been frozen salted milk. It tasted nothing like caramel and was incredibly salty. I will never go back to a Jeni's
__label__5	"Super fresh and refreshing.
We just finished out first ever cleanse.  Not going to lie, I wasn't sure what to expect but I expected some of the juices to taste dirt. None of them tasted any less than delicious! Our favorites : Fresh Air, Lean Elixir, Fat Burner, and Pink were the winners.  Pink is the most drinkable and refreshing."
__label__1	Honestly I don't know what the fuss is about. It's basic food on boring white plates in a place that just flips tables all night...weee
__label__1	We ordered take-out. Our order took an hour when they told us it should have only taken 20 minutes, and three other customers who came in about 10-15 minutes after us received their orders before ours. Also, while we were waiting, they didn't offer us water. The main waitress in the front also gave a really bad attitude with her facial expressions.
__label__5	So thankful to Olga who did a signature facial for me last night. I was so calm and relaxed and felt comfortable trusting my combination skin in her hands. It was a 70 minute facial worth every penny spent. Learned about this location after receiving a gift card from my boss. I would absolutely recommend Olga and the professional La Difference team. My first impression was a positive one as a gentleman opened the door for me and then wished me goodnight as I left.  The whole package!
__label__4	"What can I say about this place? It is great for families or adults only.  The food never disappoints. Always a good are the fish tacos. We also had the soup and bread which was also a pleaser. The pound of peel and eat shrimp is our favorite appetizer by far. 
On my last visit I had the Hags brew ,an alcoholic drink and it was great. Highly suggest the peel and eat shrimp followed by the fish tacos and the Hags Brew."
__label__2	Disappointed. I was excited to try this restaurant because of the food and entertainment. The service was friendly; however, we had to wait for a long, long time to get fed. the food was ok but not blown away.
__label__4	My friends  and I have been to Sparkman about 5-6 times since opening. We love the food, the atmosphere, the drinks, the beer etc. It is just still a little too packed I think because of the recent opening, and there is just not enough places to sit and hang out. it has been very crowded on weekend nights, especially for lightning games. They could use another bar with liquor, edison's is expensive, not very wide selection, and runs out of ingredients almost every time we are there.
__label__4	Amazing pizza and you have to try the BBQ Shrimp Poboy.  It's a hidden treasure in a menu full of Italian food.
__label__2	I tried out a Brazilian wax here, and the wax took over 55 minutes! I ended up leaving without finishing the wax, and was disappointed.
__label__3	Service department made some mistakes with my vehicle but they did try to make it right once it's said and done.
__label__5	This restaurant was pretty busy on a Tuesday night, but service was still fast after we decided what to order! They always have $2 domestic, and their import list was $5 and under. Definitely check it out around lunch as their specials mean you can try more for less. The only thing is they were playing top 40 music which clashed with the more traditional decor. The spicy yellowtail roll was fantastic!
__label__1	Would love to tell you about the food at this restaurant but I'm unable to do so. My husband and I entered the restaurant on Sunday morning to enjoy breakfast. We were seated and waited for someone to wait on us. After five minutes of watching other families receive menus and food and still not having a waiter or waitress approach our table we finally got up and left. I attempted on many occasions to make eye contact with the servers in the hopes of getting their attention but I simply had servers look at me and walk away.
__label__1	Their pizza is average. Their sandwiches are less than average. Overcooked meat that is lacking flavor. There is nothing exciting about their food.
__label__3	"This place is normally great, especially for the price, but this experience was ""meh"" at best. I tried their sesame chicken this time. Mistake. It was thin slices of chicken, fried for too long, doused in a regrettable, sugary sauce. Pass on this option and try one of their stir-fry options. They taste fresher and you won't leave feeling ripped off. Service was pretty mediocre this time also."
__label__5	This is a wonderful restaurant. The vibe is really great and there are healthier food options still served in a haute cuisine manner. Highly recommend this place.
__label__4	We love Mexican and seen this place tucked in this shopping mall. We decided to try it. The food was great and so was the chips and dip! Our only complaint was the service it was just 1 girl who was tying her best but the more people that came in the harder it was for her. The need more waitress's
__label__4	Really cool spot with great outdoor music. Felt like a local place but who knows really, our air bnb hosts recommended. Food is tapas style and the menu is always changing depending on what's in season.
__label__5	A fun, funky joint in East Nashville. Marcia couldn't have been more accommodating and terrific, and the food couldn't be tastier. If you want a casual genuine local Nashville experience, head there!
__label__4	"Great selection of beer.  Quesadillas were really delicious with a great outdoor patio if the weather is nice.  The wait staff are a divide and conquer structure, so it can sometimes take a little while for a check, but you don't really want to leave quickly anyway. 

Other favorites from the menu include chicken burrito and the burger."
__label__1	Had the two worst desserts in my life!  Could not eat more than one bite of the tiramisu. Dry. Tasteless. Old. My friend had a raspberry nut item. It was beyond dry. Actually it was burnt. One bite. This is the only really negative I have ever posted. If this place is open next year at this time I will buy everyone in the store a free dessert on me!!
__label__5	Food is always excellent. Thank you to Craig - the Manager I believe who made things right when I got the wrong order.  Such fantastic customer service and the added treats are greatly appreciated.
__label__3	"Food is good. Top tier fingerlings, great ziti and the pizza is good (if it's hot, it occasionally comes out cold)
I'm usually willing to pay a premium for good food, but the prices are especially absurd.
Protip: do not order a half-size salad (and by proxy a full salad), the portions are LAUGHABLE. They might have the caloric content to sustain a very, very young hamster."
__label__2	"Very pricey seafood for a below Red Lobster quality experience. I was there on the 17th of November for an anniversary, hoping to enjoy a special top notch meal... the contrary is what happened. 
We ordered hushpuppies that were full of actual corn, definitely should be labeled corn fritters. 
We ordered crab which was 42$ for an unimpressive spread.  
Overall the service was okay. Our server checked on us regularly and was nice. It was more the price/food quality that was off. 
If you're going to pay that price, you're better off eating somewhere else."
__label__1	"$30 for 2 terrible excuses for an Old Fashioned.

My girlfriend and I walk in and ask the bartender what's their best cocktail, he made us a couple Old Fashioned's. Perfect, since I love me a good old fashioned but after receiving my $30 tab for the two drinks and after having a couple sips, I think I'll pass on ordering anything else from there. 

Live music was good..."
__label__3	"This Little Caesars is perfectly fine for what it is = cheap pizza, staffed with high schoolers.
I called and ordered a pizza and while there were about 5 people who had placed walk in orders waiting, my pizza was ready to go.

Ordered a deep dish with x cheese and mushrooms.  My only complaint was the tough mushrooms. 
For a $11 pizza that can easily feed 4 people, it's a great deal."
__label__5	This place is pricey, but the experience is definitely worth it.  The filet with foie gras is incredible!  I recommend this place for a business dinner or for anyone you want to impressed.
__label__1	Worst experience at a dentist office ever. Wait time is tremendous. The staff obviously did not care about their clients. The staff was talking in the hallways for about 10 minutes while I was waiting to have one of them come in and see me. Of course I could overheat their conversations and it was nothing work-related. I can see why the wait is so long. I never went back. Period.
__label__5	"Absolutely do not pass go- get to Bookers!  The food is wonderful and the chef is beyond good.  It's definitely the first place I'd recommend you visit if you come to West Philly.
The staff are also accommodating and fast.

Definitely try this place if you haven't already!!!"
__label__5	Excellent service, staff are very polite. Your veal parmigiano is my favorite dish of any restaurant. Coming back soon.  THANKS!!!
__label__5	"Great burgers! Pleasantly surprised by the Florida brews on tap! 
Found this place through Yelp reviews. Great place to watch a game, relax at the bar and have some good food."
__label__2	Came here for a perm, left with a frizzy mess that didn't hold. Atmosphere is nice and color lab looks great, but if a perm is what you want, look elsewhere.
__label__1	"Have been on hold with customer service for almost an hour, to get a replacement part, for a broken dresser that we had to return twice already!!! 

This company does not stand by their product, and they give you absolute trash. We spent over $3,000 on a set and mattress, we should NOT be treated this way!"
__label__5	Revelyn is the best!!  Highly recommend her. I won't go to anyone else. She is exceptional and she does both my daughters eyebrows too.
__label__5	I love this nail salon! It's an uptown gem. The atmosphere is very relaxed. They have a wide variety of polishes (Essie, OPI, shellac, etc.). The ladies who work in there are super sweet and professional. They always want to hear the latest gossip about my life. One time I had to bring my son with me and they had a ball with him. He taught them how to play his Leap Pad, they taught him some words in Vietnamese. Super cute!  They have you in and out and offer waxing and other services.
__label__5	Great, authentic, Island cuisine! Family owned and operated for an endearing feel! My wife and I have had beef patties all over the city, and these are by far the best. Phenomenal service, we'll definitely be back to try the entire menu, and we can not wait. I highly recommend this place to anyone in the Brandon area.
__label__5	"Every time I visit, typically for breakfast, I am warmly welcomed.

This is a well established Cuban restaurant just east of Dale Mabry on Hillsborough Avenue. Lots of locals. Real family atmosphere. Attractive brick  interior. Hispanic music in background.

Great deviled crab, Cuban sandwiches and caldo gallego (turnip greens) soup rarely found at local cuban restaurants except for the Columbia in Ybor. 

Reasonably priced entrees. Definitely worth a visit. Credit cards accepted."
__label__2	It took 11 minutes to get through the drive thru Sunday when they're only two cars ahead of me. Normally I would go to Chick fil A where there can be 10 cars ahead of you still get through in 2 minutes or less. The chicken was hot and juicy and it was very delicious. I think the girl at the drive thru was brand new. 44
__label__1	delayed shipment，decisive status update，bad sevice...what can i say？despite good furniture and elegant design，aweful customer service
__label__1	You know it's bad when the cashiers are complaining to you while you are trying to buy a few items. The whole place is depressed and no one seems to really want to be there - the customers or the employees. There's no incentive for the cashiers to be quick - they are miserable and want you to be too!
__label__4	just had an enjoyable deal from.yelp @ this.v. tasty little gem....we loved the fallafel platter w/ great cucumber salad, hummus, hot pita to die for..friendly service.kept making sure we were happy..inexoensive. plentl portions. go for the food...not ambience...we are going back to try their pizza!
__label__4	My husband and I purchased a travel trailer this past April.  We found a few issues when inspecting the camper on delivery (leaky faucet, fantastic fan did not work, trim damaged).  When we voiced our concern, they made it right by repairing the problems right then and there. I would consider purchasing from them again.
__label__5	Great location, food and drinks I had the honey hot wings, fries, salsa and cheese dip.
__label__5	Tom is awesome! THE Catering Company catered our outdoor wedding for 140 guests, and truly went above and beyond. He's down to earth and understood our needs - plus, the food was amazing and delicious - and beautiful too. I can't say enough things: HIGHLY recommend!
__label__5	My wife and I were blown away by how good this place was. A real breath of fresh air compared to some of the restaurants up by us.
__label__5	My son was a little nervous bc he had a wrist injury.  Dr Krunis made it light hearted and actually cracked us up with jokes.  He took time to give him some exercises and really takes though our situation.  What a pleasant visit.
__label__5	Loved this shop! So many macaron varieties to choose from. They were fresh and delicious. I think my favorite was the salted caramel. I also had a caramel latte and it was yummy. The workers were very friendly. I'd love to come back if I'm in the area again!
__label__4	My favorite karaoke Place. Been going there for over 10 years off and on. Same karaoke kj too he's a good guy. Place gets a little rough on certain nights but one of my favorite places
__label__5	"Major was a great experience. I had #15 which was a large platter of different vegetarian dishes.  The injera was freshly made and the flavors were bright and flavorful.  The owner was very friendly and attentive.  As other reviewers noted, the location isn't prime real estate but once inside the atmosphere oozes the character of the owner... Friendly & warm.

Try it... I wish I had more time in Indy to explore the menu further."
__label__1	God I haaaattte this place this is the worst place ever I saw wait I hate spiders and There was a Black widow spider husband killed it next there was a GIANT peice of POO on the bed I asked housekeeping to get it but my child went to the hospital to get his stomach pumped because housekeeping shoved it down his throat And housekeeping probably KILLED someone because there was a pool of BLOOD on the floor and saw two cockroaches on the floor NEEEEEEEEVVVVVVVVVVVEEEEEEERRRRRR will go again
__label__1	Ordered Chicken Parm first and the chicken was extremely tough with the sauce having way too much onion and not much else flavor.  Sent it back and ordered the chicken Alfredo, completely flavorless and the chicken was just overcooked frozen Tyson chicken, you know, the stuff that's already precooked.  The bread was great though.  My wife got the spaghetti, just as disgusting.  My friend got some baked fish, disgusting as well.  His pregnant girlfriend got the cod sandwich, she was up all night vomiting and with diarrhea.  If I could give this place negative stars I would.  DONT EAT HERE!
__label__5	Nice rooms and shower pressure was great. Check in was fast and staff is friendly. Free breakfast. Hotel is right near the on / off ramp of the interstate. So its very easy to get to.
__label__5	My biggest regret is not knowing about this place sooner. They always get our carryout orders correct. I am a sucker for the Davey special because the sauce and chewy cheese garlic bread is the best. Husband loves the baked spaghetti and we both love the white french house salad. Mmm!
__label__5	My husband and I stopped in for the first time tonight.. We had the calamari app which was tasty and cooked perfectly. I had the captains platter and he had the reef platter which we both enjoyed very much. Our server from Mass. (Cheryl) spelled the same way as mine, was very attentive and personable. I would highly recommend her seeing it was only her 2nd serving shift at this establishment and she was fantastic:))
__label__5	I had a hankering for a good steak and my nose took me here. I arrived on a Saturday at 7 pm sans reservations. Because it is a popular place, I suggest getting a reservation; however, since I have no friends and was by myself, I happily ate at the bar. I ordered a NY Strip and fries. It was perfection, perfectly cooked and presented. It is a little pricey, but I do not mind spending $$$ for quality food and even better service. It was my best meal so far in St. Louis
__label__5	"Honest about ""immediate necessity vs. watch the site for activity.""  Competitive pricing and arrives promptly when scheduled. Complete disclosure of product options and pros-cons. Tucson is termite territory, and home deserves not being host to destruction.  I'd also like my barefoot habit not to be hobbled by a scorpion's sting. Thank you very much ;-)"
__label__4	Awesome Pastrami! Mom's PLT is the way to go.  I'll be seeing more of this place for sure.
__label__4	This place is great. I love a good cheeseburger and this place is a great place to get one. I love the bread and butter pickles and the mayo bar is great too! I do kinda wish I could get some lettuce on my burger, but I think it's their thing to not have it available. I love the beer selection, I love the minimalistic serveware, feels like I am at a picnic or something. It's a good place to go with kids because it's really laid back and also would be good for a rowdy group of friends.
__label__5	"We drove all the way from North Jersey to visit this place. Reminded me of the middle east. The food was so simple and fresh as arabic food should be. Everything was light, fresh, tasty and beautifully plated. This is like moms cooking, the fresh bread that baked off before it gets to your table is what makes this place worth a visit. 

If you like arabic food, you'll love Suraya."
__label__5	Great restaurant for breakfast, lunch,dinner. They have Vegetarian options and are always good!
__label__4	"This was our first time here. Our family said ""DO OVER""! We can't wait to visit again and try more of this perfect find! 
Service was great! Friendly and kind! We recommend it if only for the fantastic aroma as you walk in!!"
__label__4	A little hidden gem!  We have been waiting in line all over town and we walk right in to this place!  Great blueberry biscuits...
__label__5	"Back again. Fantastic meal with friends. We keep
Coming back. All positives. Steaks are always delicious. Had the prime rib special this time. Came with mashed potatoe tater tots. So good.
We try to come at least once a month. 
Another delicious meal. Porterhouse steak for 2 is so good."
__label__3	"Everyone has told me I needed to check this place out so I gave it a go and used their deliver service. I was having a particularly lazy day so the delivery was a great perk. 

But the food.... it was what I expected. Not to be as good as what people have told me. I got the basil pesto pasta, it came with a salad and garlic bread. The garlic bread was slightly stale and I had to add additional oil to my pasta because it was dry and stuck together. It had very little flavor as well. 

Unfortunately, I will probably not order this food again."
__label__3	Friendly bartender, The beer was middle of the road quality.  Folks seemed to enjoy the Molecular Munchies food truck.  The ambiance fits the tech park environment.
__label__5	Beautiful restaurant.  Went for a breakfast with my husband and three young boys. My husband had an egg skillet and the kids and I had pancakes and bacon. Everything was yummy and the server was so nice and accommodating. Definitely recommend!
__label__4	Really cool new barcade in Nashville. $0.50 cent games and free skeeball. Coolest wallpaper ever.
__label__4	I've had solid experiences here, first when I bought my car and the couple of times it's been in for service. I would trust them more with servicing my car than the other questionable repair places around this area.
__label__4	We found this place near our hotel we stayed in downtown and decided to try it out. My dad is vegan and was able to find a dish with the help of our waitress, who was very patient and sweet with us! Our food came out and tasted delicious. I would definitely come back again. I really liked the atmosphere and service there!
__label__4	Greats mussels... Ate too much, yummy. Service was great. Not very busy. Quality seafood.
__label__4	"This place is super cool, original and hip! 
EVERYTHING IS RED! 
Their beer selection is adequate, nothing too spectacular, but they won't break the bank and you can get your craft beer fill if you're not too picky.
The upstairs area is my favorite to sit on the weird chairs and watch whatever movie they are playing on the big projector-wall (last time it was A Scanner Darkly).
Tip: go to the bathroom, it's kinda trippy."
__label__4	"I go to the Sprouts in Arizona and California. The newest one in Arizona was laid out exactly like this one. It felt like home. 

It was extremely clean and well-organized. The staff was pleasant and as soon as they realized everyone in the entire store decided to check out at the same time, they added 2 more cashiers."
__label__5	Fantastic ingredients! I'm not convinced that this Detroit upside down method is better than normal, but the cheesy crispy edges and very very good sausage made for a fine, fine post Busch Gardens dinner!!
__label__4	Fascinating stuff. A good alternative to art museums.
__label__5	The staff were friendly and attentive. The  food arrived quickly. The meat was delicious! The variety of sauces were tasty and interesting. The sides were a little odd and cheddar pop overs were not to our taste. Maybe if they were served with honey butter or garlic butter or something. By themselves they were meh but overall a nice meal. Good atmosphere
__label__3	"The Beignets were awesome once we got them. Ordered at 11:06 and had to grab someone to get our food at 11:26 finally got the single order of beignets at 11:28 so not excited about the service. 

However we liked the Beignets and the selection of other goodies a lot more than other places."
__label__5	Great live island music food was great we had grouper sandwich and grouper tacos. Try the place reviews are wrong. Service was perfect!!!
__label__1	This is not a place I would recommend at all. I had issues with billing and with the owner Lisa Foley.
__label__1	If I could give 1 star I would, but this food is atrocious. It had no taste, it was greasy, and just tasted bad. They don't give refunds, or else they'd never make money. The food was ridiculously overpriced for Chinese. STL Chinese food is much better than this place.
__label__5	Ordered 4 Cheese Steaks and had them shipped to Our home on Cape Cod. Undoubtedly the greatest sandwiches we ever had.
__label__2	"We have been living in Santa Barbara for 5 years, 
Finch & Fork used to be one of our favorite places to go but...
Please change/renew your menu!!!
I've ordered every appetizer/entree/dessert at least 10+ times already and got bored!!!!"
__label__5	"Love the Crafters Library!  I learned how to paint on silk to make wonderful hankies and scarves. I etched  a design on a vase to give as a wedding present (great idea by the way).  In fact, I am thinking now about what craft classes I can use to make Christmas presents for everyone this year!
Andrew and Rachel and everyone else (sorry - can't remember the names - next time!) are so nice and fun and helpful. Oh and I adore the paper flower bouquets! Trying to talk a friend into making one for me.
So much fun here!"
__label__5	It's tasty, it's inexpensive, the waiters are all nice. You realyl can't loose. Plus, delivery, take out, and a buffet make it perfect for a busy week night.
__label__2	Might as well order and pick-up. The food is delicious, but the service is awful. After over 20 minutes of waiting for our server to take our order, we left (and we weren't the only ones to do so).
__label__5	"Pork belly sandwich! Simple and totally delicious.

The side mac and cheese was as rich and comforting as I could have hoped and the cocktails were hand crafted and delicious."
__label__5	"We love the cupcakes. They are high quality, large in size and leave you very satisfied with the treat. Granted they charge a premium for them, and rightfully so. 

There's no comparison to cupcakes from the store vs these. 

There are multiple locations around the city."
__label__5	"First time eating craw fish,  these were amazing! They are spicy with just the right amount of heat. The guys were so nice, they grabbed six craw fish and showed me how to eat the lil buggers..
We ordered a pound and dug in, one of the best new foods on my trip to NOLA.  Will definitely be coming back, I'm  addicted!"
__label__5	Jenes is absolutely amazing I will recommend her for life! She kills it every time and always accommodates if I break one. I tend bar so I'm very rough on my nails and she always goes above and beyond. I  Jenes.
__label__5	"This is a diner in the truest sense of the word.  It's cheap, fast, and good.  They have a ""hungry man breakfast special"" that will pretty much cover half of the table with food for around $8."
__label__5	Went here last night and it did not disappoint. We tried the lamb, the filet mignon, the tuna with crawfish, and the red snapper with crab. It was all delicious. Don't forget to get your parking validated if you park in the garage next door.
__label__4	I'm normally not a Gap fan, but this outpost is much more upscale, so it somehow manages to escape the Gap's usual role as the emblem of bland suburbia. I also owe them big-time for carrying maternity clothes that are actually cute and professional-looking, as well as reasonably priced.  Oddly enough, the Gap's maternity line is better quality than their regular clothes; it's more like Banana Republic.
__label__4	Really cool new place on Mass Ave and the food is great! I love the set up. You can personalize your tacos by filling out the menu card. I would recommend the sweet Lucy. The taco is very sturdy and food doesn't fall you when you bite in like most tacos. One complaint was that my steak was cold and that I had to pay $1 extra. Everything else was great though! Very affordable as well if you do not over do it on the add ins. Overall I would recommend this place!
__label__4	We really enjoyed our tour. The only possible negative, would be that there was no dessert included in the tour. We would have liked a signature dessert from New Orleans.
__label__3	Cute store and fun pop flavors. Are pops were okay. My husband got a strawberry and mango pop and the mango part was not good. The mango part had a weird texture you don't want eat and bland taste. The gelato was okay but I have had better pops and gelato so would not be returning there for ice cream.
__label__1	"We just ate with my 2 grandchildren at the worst, most disgusting diner in South Jersey. The sign said they were under renovation ""we are open"" . They should have burned the place down and started over. The food was horrible. We had to send one of the orders back to the kitchen. The 2 tables next to us sent all their food back. Besides a really mediocre waitress, the restaurant and the bathrooms were dirty and disgusting. Do not go to this diner. We live in New Jersey and go to diners all the time . We will never go back, even after the ""renovations""!!"
__label__4	"Wow, great burger called the Morning After Burger!!! 10 oz. burger with bacon, onion rings, cheese of your choice, sunny side up egg, on a Jalapeno Cheddar bun.
Side of o-rings, definitely cured the appetite. Girlfriend got the Pork steak with an orange-cranberry glaze, delicous!!!! Sides were stuffing and asparagus, she loved it !! Another two thumbs up!!"
__label__5	Love this place. Its a little pricy, but you get a great amount of food for what you pay for. I love the teriyaki beef and lobster tail the most. We always ask for extra mushrooms because the mushrooms cooked with gorgonzola sauce are to die for. This time around we also paid extra for cheesecake to dip in our chocolate and WOW it's so worth it!
__label__5	"I love Indian food and have tried many restaurants. Rasoi is, hands down, the best I have ever sampled. Wow!  These dishes are so savory and authentic. The servers are so pleasant and courteous. The owner explained how she was taught to cook by her family as a child in India and has brought these native dishes to Tampa. I am vegetarian but my husband and friends are not and we all had plenty of various options.  My favorite is anything with their homemade ""paneer""(like an Indian cottage cheese).  This place is going to be a huge hit for people who like international cuisine."
__label__4	Cost $14 for students. Very nicely laid out museum filled with beautiful art! This is definitely one that is interesting and fun for all ages. Docking one star off for a security guard's unprofessional behavior when he approached us to get our personal info.
__label__5	"One of the best lunch specials in downtown indy- where else can you get an authentic Dominican dish for only 4.98?
The owner is friendly and attentive.
GREAT DEAL."
__label__5	The fact that I can walk one block over and get some tasty bagels and great service. The bagels are also made in house and they have a variety of flavors I'm waiting for some rainbow or colorful bagels because I will buy all of them. Give them a try if you're in the neighborhood the veggie cream cheese is also great!!!!
__label__2	The reason for two stars was because it didn't seem very sanitary. There were so many flies, and the restaurant itself didn't look very clean. Most of the dishes were bland, including the kimchi fried rice and jap chae. The waitress was great, but fir the price will not come back.
__label__5	Two things I do often are travel and eat! Pho is one of my favorite dishes, and the Pho at this place is ON TIME!
__label__5	I visited to see the divafest 2016 show Zora's Tales. Note* only cash is accepted at the bar. And $1 surcharge for admission if paying by cc. The theatre is very quaint and intimate. The show was moving and lively and the actors seemed passionate. Great opportunity to experience local theatre.
__label__2	Service was slow and the food was not worth the wait. The chicken taco was extremely bland no flavor. Everything on the menu is a la carte. Don't waste your time waiting. This place could be a cute place to hang out with friends but it needs a lot of work on the service and food. They also need to add a signature drink menu and get away from the a la carte food.
__label__3	I really like the salads here but in the 10-20 times I have been here they never get the ingredients correct (and the salad is one from their menu!!!!) How hard is it to train staff what ingredients go in salads that are on the board??? They really need to do a better job with their hiring!
__label__4	"Our second go to place for coffee when Coffee Muse was closed.

1. excellent service
2. average coffee, on the bitter side
3. patio
4. using square if you want to pay by card
5.has soy and vegan pastries"
__label__1	"So, I just listened back and feel sad that Frank was way off.
Maybe I wasn't open?
Nothing on our recording happened.
It makes me so sad because he was so sweet.

Give him a try, he might work for you!!!!"
__label__5	Went here August 2020; Great customer service. A worker named Larry and some other dude with a pony tail we're very helpful.
__label__1	Food was disappointing ordered toppings for my hash browns and they were sparse. My daughters was fine. The older waitress was very nice and great customer service. Not sure if our order got lost it took forever.
__label__5	The best. I am from Utah and have tried several coffee places in Boise. This place takes them all! Such a beautiful location, and the coffee is the same, consistent yumminess every time. Thanks guys! Congrats on your new place.  I hope it works out well for you!
__label__4	"This is my go to sandwich place. The ingredients are always fresh and the combination of flavours are on point. I have yet to try all of the sandwiches but I am slowly making my way through the menu.

I recommend the Spicy Italian with the Peach Lemonade and Cherry Iced Tea mixed. That's right, Arnold Palmer style. 

And if that's not enough food, you can add sides like a ginormous pickle, pepperoni sticks, cookies, housemade chips and ice cream sandwiches! 

Yummm!"
__label__4	Not the best but not the worst either. I think the one on Delaware Ave is way worse than this, plus this one has a gas station.
__label__5	If I could do 6 stars, I would.  Great food and Service with a Smile!   Super friendly.  This is the real deal, not a processed breakfast chain.  Food made with pride.  Great atmosphere.  Generous portions and prices.  This is the place to go!
__label__2	I got soft pretzels here 2 years ago; my recollection was that I enjoyed those. So, I returned yesterday to find that their product is mediocre (at best) or, at least, inconsistent. I know I can find better elsewhere and consequently won't return.
__label__5	Yum.  yum.  yum.  Wonderfully tasty food.  Started with a great salad.  My entree was duck with turnips, which was absolutely amazing.  Medium rare perfection and an awesome sauce.  The homemade ice cream (vanilla custard caramelized banana) was some of the best ice cream I've ever had.  And the prices are very reasonable here.  Will definitely be coming back
__label__5	Really high quality ice cream that's local, for once! Awesome flavours that are both versatile and intriguing. Lots of potential for great ice cream floats and shakes as well. Would be nice to have a root beer float offered, and possibly a build your own ice cream Sunday bar! Just an idea though ;)
__label__5	Love the white pizza spinach and ricotta, great garlic knots too! Been going here for years. Really good pizza, great family business, inside is good for  groups up to 20!
__label__4	Love T&B, great use of an old building along with a great concept/selection of BEER and wine!  Food trucks fill your food needs on Fri/Sat and we had MoFooCo and the (name slips my mind) Indian food truck so the wife and I both found selections we lilked.  The vast beer selection (tap or bottle) is reason enough to make T&B a go to spot on each Tucson visit!  I will agree on the Saturday night limited seating but we got counter space under the beverage listing boards.
__label__4	"This is a cute boutique hotel, kinda quirky vibe but not in a bad way.  They gave our little doxie a gift bag of dog treats which she loved!  Nice touch.  The hotel has a bar and lounge, and an onsite restaraunt which provides room service.  Room with king sized bed was super sized, plenty of room.  Bathroom was modest, nicely decorated but in need of minor clean up on the ceiling....again, nothing bad, just unsightly in spots.

Overall this was a pleasant experience, great deal!"
__label__2	What can I say? Its a Steak n Shake. The service is beyond slow and the food is only good at 2am when everything else is closed. I'll regret eating here in the morning.
__label__5	We bought a new home and needed to get a new electric switchboard as soon as possible so we could begin work on other projects. Tom Leonard was quick in responding to come out for a free quote, and communicated with us throughout the process. I hope I don't need an electrician again, but if I do, I know who I'm calling.
__label__1	If you have only 30 minutes for lunch, I would avoid this place like the plague. 2 separate times I've had to ask my boss for 5 minutes to devour my sub. The food is great, The Engineer is my favorite. But nothing is worth wasting an entire break for something you have no remaining time to eat. The first time this happen I thought it was just a one time thing and worth a chance to try again. The second time, there was 4 people in front of me and I'm waiting 25 minutes. Good food, just can't go on a time restraint.
__label__2	"Overpriced and over hyped. 

This place got a lot of positive hype when it opened, but I'm underwhelmed. My burger was pretty good, but considering the price, should have been much, much better.

My wife doesn't eat beef and was looking forward to eat the veggie burger. But it was so dry and so bland, she says it's the worst she's ever had eating out."
__label__2	"I have a few friends that work at this hotel but that doesn't mean I am going to sugarcoat things. The food here simply isn't anything to write home about. I've eaten breakfast here on numerous occasions for free so I am familiar with their runny eggs, bland breakfast potatoes, and greasy sausage links. Even when it was called 2150 City Grill as a Radisson property the food was the same low quality. 

I will say that Fab and Nina are super friendly, though, and take care of their customers."
__label__1	"We have eaten here 4 times since they opened, but vowed the last time will actually be our last. The food here is sub-par in relation to other Thai Food restaurants in Indianapolis (under-spiced & blah flavor). The service is HORRIBLE. 

Save your money. The Thai food from the ""International Aisle"" of Kroger is tastier & more authentic than this restaurant.

It is a shame. Plainfield needs a good Thai restaurant.  Thai Orchid isn't it."
__label__5	Amazing custom drinks and amazing dinner. Fabulous atmosphere and great service. A must do!
__label__5	Beth was unbelievably helpful. Repaired my boyfriend's cracked iphone 8 screen in less than 30 minutes all while making us laugh. Price is reasonable, especially for the great work she did. thank you beth!
__label__5	Had a few beers here on Saturday with my wife and two friends. The place is nice and very well spread out, so seating was a breeze. I had two flights and got to try a few different beers. All were great and the staff was friendly and fast. Couldn't ask for a better time.
__label__4	I think 3.75 is likely the best rating, but since that isn't an option, and they are clearly better than a 3, I gave them a 4. The food is solid, but not great. My lasagna was unlike ANY lasagna I had ever had, in fact I kept wondering if I actually got lasagna. The structure, sauce, flavor,  etc, was just not traditional. Salad was good as always.
__label__5	Great dentist and staff. The service was great, everyone makes you feel welcome from the moment you walk in, explained every part of the process and answered all my questions. I highly recommend this office to all my friends and family.  Thank You Dr. C!
__label__3	Found this location off Open Table as it had just opened.  So took a chance and went in.  Had the bison burger and it was good.  I think I have more to say about the interior than the food.  Clearly this was an old bar or something before and they spent minimal amounts on the decor.  Sad, because if the place was more inviting, the food experience would be a lot better.  Would still recommend someone going to try as others would suggest, but don't expect to be wowed by some cute gem of a restaurant.
__label__5	"Britt did my hair and wow did she suggest an awesome style..choppy haircut with blonde and purple low lights.   She was so friendly and pretty much could tell what kind of cut I wanted.  

This place is cute, hip, on the vintage side.

I was referred by one of the news anchors in the area I worked with at that time.  I was very satisfied with the outcome- as nervous as I was getting that purple into my hair, it turned out just fabulous and everyone loved it :)

When I move back to Nashville, of course I'm coming back of Trim!"
__label__5	"Gogi BBQ is a refreshing addition to this city's Korean restaurant scene. Went here shortly after their Grand Opening.

Ample parking.
Very clean. 
Service is A ++!
Friendly, fast, and knowledgeable.

Their buffet/sauce bar is well stocked and is really fresh. My boyfriend was raving about the corn and the server informed us that the owner has an organic farm and it was directly farmed from him!
Me, personally, I liked their pork belly the best. ;p

I will definitely be coming here again!!"
__label__4	I've eaten here a few times over the years.  As with the rest of Gulfport, it is very quaint.  It serves good seafood dishes in a relaxed atmosphere.  They also make a very good corn and crab chowder.  I definitely recommend if you are in the area. You
__label__5	This place never ever disappoints. We live in Ventura where it's mainly Pizza Man Dans and Toppers. Which I am sick of. But every time we go to Santa Barbara, we always get Rusty's. They have the best crust. Just wish they would bring a Rusty's back to Ventura.
__label__5	Charming Nails is a super-clean nail salon with the nicest people. They have always done a great job on my nails and have worked me in on the few occasions that I did not have an appointment. I love the comfy massage chairs and definitely recommend this nail salon to anyone that's not yet familiar with it. Plenty of parking in the back too.
__label__5	Would not take my car anywhere else! The staff is super friendly and I trust them to take care of my car for the cheapest price possible. I do not leave reviews very often, but I was super impressed with my experience here. I would recommend this team to anyone, they really treat you like family. 5 stars!!!
__label__5	This was a fantastic experience and well worth the price. It's the most fun I've had in a while with a group of hard-headed friends! The clues are tough enough to give anyone pause, but if you work together, you can get them. We did it with 3 and half minutes left. The experience is so unique and the hour flies by! (Be careful!) I would highly recommend this to anyone that loves puzzles and unique experiences. Keep it up, Escape the Room Philly!!
__label__5	What a great experience and amazing food.  On top of that we had Troy and Marcos as our servers and they were great, funny, and entertained us.  We'll definitely be back!  Couldn't have asked for better!!
__label__4	We love sports clips!! We have been taking my son to this location since he was a year old and they are amazing with him.  At 3 years old he now sits all by himself in the chair for his haircut. Ask for Sarah, she is so patient and so sweet with kids. We wouldn't take him anywhere else!!
__label__5	Amazing venue. Laid back, comfortable. Grab a coffee or linger downstairs, upstairs, outside. Admittedly, I probably lingered here too long and too often, it was a great place to write and sketch.
__label__5	This is my go to for shawarma on the north side. Their new location is spacious and the staff friendly and smiling! I can't wait to try their new menu items. Their garlic sauce is on point!
__label__1	the staff has gone downhill and do not care one bit about the customers... each visit leads to a progressively worse experience
__label__1	Had a bunny die from this location. It was a horrible experience for my daughter to go through. They refunded my money and paid vet bills but it does not erase what happened. Do not get a bunny from here. My vet told me it was possible abscess from guinea pig bites which they are housed with them in the store.
__label__4	"Easy to stroll through this with many different offerings regarding one of our greatest founding fathers. $5 for adults and no stress or pressure to ""keep moving"". Learned a few new things about the amazing fellow. 

Worth a walk through. This is an enjoyable interactive museum. We were here on a Saturday AM in March. 

Mark."
__label__1	"Pretty terrible all around

We got 2 coffees - decided to just throw them away and not risk ordering food.  I dont expect much out of an airport restaurant, but this was terrible.

Walk over to burger king and have it your way"
__label__3	This was my very first Brazilian wax, so of course I was nervous! When I walked in, they were playing relaxing spa music over the speakers. Destinee made my experience comfortable. All during the wax, she kept making sure I was okay. After the wax was complete, I received a paper that instructed me on aftercare and a small box of chocolates. The reason I gave 3 STARS was because after arriving home I discovered that wax was still left on me and even worse she did not get all of the hair. Because of that I don't think I will be returning here to get a wax.
__label__5	"I really enjoy stopping into Rockler when looking for an item I'm after.

The staff is always friendly and helpful and seems truly interested in helping you find what you need and not trying to sell you a bunch of stuff you don't.

They also have free demos every Saturday which are really fun to see as well as hosting other community activities.

As a new woodworker I was very happy to find this awesome store!"
__label__5	"When friends and family come to town who partake in consuming alcohol, we start them off here. Their wallet generally thanks us, as it is from my experience, the cheapest place downtown to drink. They have great happy hour deals, including weekends. 

The music is phenomenal. I would recommend reservations if going after 6, which can be booked online. 

The food here is great too, and customer service is top notch!"
__label__5	Picked up 9 dozen donuts. Everyone loved them. Glazed were perfectly soft. And chocolate were equally good. Will be back next time I'm in town.
__label__1	I placed a take out order at 6:10 PM. I came in at 7:30 PM, and the food was not ready. In fact, they hadn't even read the email that I placed the order with. They then said I would wait five minutes to get the food, and it has already been 10 minutes and still nothing. This is just bad service...
__label__4	"Stopped in again on Wednesday evening and sat at the bar where Katie took really good care of me.  I was only stopping for a draft beer but ended up staying for a French dip sandwich, with the gruyere.  It was very good, loaded with enough beef and dipping sauce, and some horseradish sauce as well with just enough kick in it.  

Nice crowd , so nice to see local spots in Webster area busy."
__label__5	"Thankfully I was staying right by the Philadelphia location. Even though as have Dr Martens  shoe store in Beijing they don't have the selection the Philadelphia store has .  I love my shoes . I opted for a bigger size . I had been looking for months but couldn't find a pair I liked in China . 
 Thanks again for your great service . Fantastic shows that were easy to break in"
__label__5	Always always delicious food! Love this place, great atmosphere and the best Italian food! The specials never fail either
__label__5	Was passing through and couldn't believe how good this place is.  Unbelievable pizza and meatballs!  And I've been all around and this place is the real deal.
__label__5	Love the service the food and speedy staff always positive! I've lived in SB for 6 years always a home favorite!
__label__4	absolutely love the food here..and the staff are always so nice.
__label__4	"The previous reviews are pretty much spot on.

I would say, the customer service could be a bit better.  Subtracted 1 star for that.  Not that they are bad.  But, I found them to be apathetic during my limited interactions.

Their produce section is pretty darn good.  Very reasonable prices and quality.

Mostly though, they won me over from their Amish Bakery section!!!  Haven't tried their mexican pastry section yet.  Which by the way, they have a great variety as well to chose from."
__label__5	Best chicken sandwich in Philly!!  The chicken maroosh is one of a kind. Amazing chicken, tomatoes, pickles, and the tasty garlic sauce. I recommend getting extra for your fries.
__label__4	Great local restaurant.  Good variety on the menu.  I especially enjoy the seafood dishes and the happy hour specials.  I highly recommend Catch 23 for the Monday night burger special as well.  When you go ask to have Lilly as your waitress- she is truly spectacular!
__label__4	"Good great , service sucked..., not sure if it was our waiter or the chef. 45"" waiting... But it was Friday evening @8pm... go figure"
__label__5	This toy store is amazing! I swear you can find the coolest things in here! Adult, kids, and even some baby toys! The prices are great too...like I said really cool finds in there. They have gag gifts, scary gifts, and awesome artwork type gifts. I always love to support and shop local and am so happy I have found this place. I will probably always choose this spot for stocking stuffers or Christmas gifts that you won't find anywhere else.
__label__3	Horrible customer service in admissions by Louise.  Did not know her job and slow.   Dr was in lunch combo meeting and 45 minutes late.   Checkout desk at Rheumatology slow and oblivious.  Unorganized and no answers.
__label__5	This place is so good! Their sal de mar (ahi ceviche) is amazing. The tacos are also good and my husband loves the norteno (steak) and the chicken mole tacos. This place can get very busy and orders can take up to 20-30 minutes so I often call in the order in advance. They have a special like for phone orders.
__label__5	Not only does this BAR have Actual clean bathrooms, I assume the women's was just as clean,  the kitchen is open till Midnight. Food is plentiful and fair priced.  Music. Music. They have good music. BBQ & Blues good stuff
__label__4	Kristel did my makeup and she did an amazing job. She listened to what products I wanted to use and combined that with her own experience to give me a great look. I got so many compliments that night! 1 star down because I had to wait a while to be helped.
__label__3	Within a month I've eaten food from here twice. The first time I had the Buffalo chicken fingers and they were good which is why I have given 3 stars instead of the 1 after tonight's meal. I ordered a chicken cheesesteak with mushrooms and pickles. It turned out to be hot pickle and cheese on a roll with a tiny bit of chicken and mushrooms. The onion rings are still very good but they give a smaller portion of the dipping sauce so I had to use it sparingly.
__label__4	One of my favorite lunch places. The clam chowder is great and I love their bread. My fave is the bagels, hands down. Prices are pretty high but I'm ok with splurging a little sometimes.
__label__5	My server Barbie was great we had excellent service and the food comes out so fast and it's at a amazing value
__label__5	First time trying crab claws and they were delicious! We also tried crab cakes and Jackson really liked them and loved the sauce that complimented them. The portion of the fish and chips was very large and tasty. Great staff and fun decorations.
__label__3	I guess we're in the minority but didn't think this was as amazing as everyone else. Burnt ends tasted like pot roast to me as opposed to sweet/ salty caramelized goodness. Sweet potato fries were very good.
__label__5	"It's definitely not traditional sushi, bu delicious. People who cannot eat spicy food, be careful. I ordered a commodore roll stating that ""please don't make it spicy"", but it is still a little bit spicy."
__label__5	huge crowd today at the zoo but lines to see the animals move quickly. dolphin show was awesome and the new orangutans exhibit was really cool. I highly recommend if you live in town to get the membership if you plan to go more than once.
__label__5	OMG if you haven't eaten here you are missing out on the best Italian food in SB. Small casual authentic and delicious. Do yourself a favor and gave the raviolis with Truffles. Crisp fresh salads, bread baked fresh. Gelato and many amazing grocery and deli item you can shop to take home.
__label__5	"Great experience here today. Dani was rocking the drive thru when I pulled up and was so upbeat and sweet. Her vibe continued as I got to the window and we quickly became new best friends. In the background the team was all smiles. Thanks for making my Friday guys!
** I'll let ya know how Kane Brown was next time I roll thru!"
__label__5	I have wanted to try Empamamas for the longest time and it did not disappoint! The buff chick was delicious and so was the queso. My partner had the cheeseburger and also enjoyed it a lot. Armature Works is a very cool venue and we enjoyed the atmosphere a lot. Go give this place a try if you like empanadas
__label__5	Great to do business with! I purchased my Honda Accord from these guys and wax blown away with how nice on non- pushy salesman they were! My car was in impeccable condition and the transaction was as smooth as it could be. I've always found that they have an excellent selection as well. Ask for Mark or Joe!
__label__5	Went there today with my wife for her birthday and could not have been more pleased with the experience.  We spent about 2.5 hours total the gun range.  The first 30 min was a safety lesson which was very informative and necessary because with are both novice shooters.  Once we got to our lane there was another older gentlemen who went above and beyond to help my wife get comfortable which gave us the confidence we both needed.  Price was very reasonable and will return in the very near future.
__label__4	Hands down a must try Mexican place.  From flautas, to burritos, and enchiladas, this place does it all.  Very vegetarian friendly.  They have an amazing assortment of hot sauces that add a little kick to your meal.  I usually get black bean flautas and am never disappointed.
__label__4	Excellent authentic cuisine, the tripe tacos are awesome taste great next I'll try the cow tongue tacos
__label__2	"Service lacking during Sunday lunch. Hostess not welcoming. Took over 40 minutes to seat our party of 4 when only 3 parties ahead of us and we could see so many empty tables inside! A party of 2 behind me asked if they could sit at the bar and the hostess gave the couple attitude, said ""if it was available, I'd offer it to you"" and walked away. It was available and didn't take long for separate individuals to just walk in & seat themselves."
__label__2	Overrated is about all I can say.  Vince Gill played 2 songs, Little Big Town played 2 songs.  You sit through 2 1/2 hours of old timers and hosts trying to be funny, not to mention all the advertisements.  Once we left at the end of the show we spent more time leaving the parking lot than the top 2 headliner acts combined.  Really, 2 songs from the headliners?  Drinks are $9 dollars each.....really?
__label__5	This place is great.  Always stop in when I'm in town.  Definitely the best in the area and some if the best I've had period.
__label__1	Lots of staff working however they were not all attending to the cleanliness or the experience of dining.  Most of the tables were dirty and full of dishes that needed to be cleaned.  Our table was never cleaned off as promised and they continued to clean other tables around us.  I was not sure if there was a MOD working or not as the staff kind of just did their own thing it seemed with no direction.  It was very over priced and I would have spent my money at another location in the airport.
__label__5	Stopped in because of reviews we read. The fries are nothing short of amazing. Our fish was so fresh it was great. Couple of cold beers sitting at the open air window bar overlooking the pass. That is a nice afternoon.
__label__1	"The only reason I came here is because it is close to University of Arizona campus. 

The quality of sushi is the worst that I've had in a long time. I had cheaper sushi for much higher quality.

Only come here if you need to fill your stomach and you can only eat sushi. There are far far far better options near by."
__label__4	"Such great ice cream!!! I've never had rolled ice cream before and I love this! Only misleading factor was that each topping is ""unlimited"" but you get like one Oreo ad a topping. I am used to Oreo crumbs for example for s topping. Other than that! Excellent!"
__label__4	Great coffee shop in Center City.  It has a good coffee and tea variety.  The space is open and clean.  The staff was friendly and patient.  There's also 2 areas (one center table) and one set of tables along a wall that have very long power strips tucked away which make it great for working.  Definitely recommend their rooibos tea.
__label__5	Great service and GREAT Food! The wait on our order took at 10 to 12 minutes and that was during a busy lunch hour during the week. I will visit again when in New Orleans.
__label__4	My wife and I had a really good experience here. The service was nice and the pizza was a good change from traditional pizza chains. The toppings were the best part of the pizza. The sauce was just ok but the Brussels sprout appetizer was spot on.
__label__4	Home Cookin' - Southern Soul Style... you can tell this food is cooked with love. The juiciest crispiest chicken, with flavor to the bone. And the beans were great, firm with a good flavored sauce. The employees all had a smile on and treated us like family. A definite stop for lunch!
__label__5	This place is not to be believed. It is like 100 (more?) small restaurants got together in one building offering food from all over the world. Beyond the awesome choices of what to eat there or take with you, there is this great energy. Many of the stands have their own places for you to sit and eat but there is also a central area with lots of tables. We could always find a seat. It's literally right across from the convention center and is definitely worth the 100' walk to check it out, even if you aren't hungry.
__label__5	Probably the only place in Hudson worthy of 5 stars. They have real ice cream and not some soft serve crap from a machine. They have sugar and fat free ice cream flavors for those on special diet who want a frozen treat. They serve heaping scoops so you get plenty for the price you pay.
__label__4	"My BF and I enjoyed our wine tasting. The gentleman that helped us, young, was well informed and knowledgeable on the wines he was serving us. He was very friendly, the service was great.

As for the wine ... we purchased 4 bottles. We enjoyed the wines. 

They have 3 different kinds of Riesling Wine Dry, Semi & Sweet! 

Nice selections! This is located in a outside shopping mall, I think the prices were maybe a little higher as part of the location."
__label__1	This place was terrible , they were being so rude to us, constantly asking us to leave because the waitress left soon. That spoke about us not knowing we spoke Spanish . We walked out before we ordered , terrible experience .
__label__5	Always leave with the best cut and color! Completely refreshed my hair! Thank you Eddy, Nicole and team :) ‍‍
__label__5	I love this place! Great atmosphere, delicious beer, and awesome food! I recommend the DIPA  They also have awesome cheese and meat boards, and great tasting flights!
__label__2	Service is terrible.   im giving up on this place.   They run around like crazy but they're not attentive to you at all. Food is pretty decent and it's a shame they can't be more consistent on better service
__label__4	Food is great. Love the turkey sandwich on a baguette. Only thing I don't like is the pricing. Like $1-$2 too expensive for everything except the bagels which are cheap and delicious.
__label__5	Very cute. Got the waffle sampler and a panini. Both very very good. Staff was very friendly and place was very clean, including the bathrooms. You order upfront, but they bring everything to your table.
__label__5	Great new place for dinner! The steaks we ordered were perfectly cooked and portions were exactly what we expected. Reservations are a must!
__label__5	Good food right here, freshly made burger with a wonderful bun, and awsome smash fries!
__label__4	"The flamenco dancers was what I enjoyed the most! Great entertainment with good food!
Great tourist attraction but very traditional."
__label__1	Been there many times, they give a good massage, but it's the same routine.Half of the massage is given through a blanket that they cover you with. They only seem to know one type of massage routine. They need to mix it up a bit, with different techniques. The place is very hot, not comfortable at all, and there are always distractions with the phone, the bells from the door opening and closing, people talking to each other etc.  All in all, the massages are boring.I will not be returning
__label__3	Great location, but the margaritas are average, and you can find better tacos elsewhere.
__label__4	"We were seated out in the Patio on Christmas Eve. With the heaters switched on, the place was comfy and warm.
We ordered the sfoglie de melanzane which was delicious (although I do love eggplant)
The pasta we ordered had the best garlic sauce. It wasn't too heavy. It was just perfect.
The pizza was kinda meh...
But do come here for their pasta."
__label__4	Cake is very moist and really good. We tried the peppermint chocolate sample and bought Red Velvet and Chocolate Chocolate Chip. We were going to grab a quick snack and continue shopping but they don't have a place to sit and eat. If they got rid of some of the tchotchkes they could put in a couple tables and chairs and use nicer plastic ware so there is nothing to wash or cleanup. Would have been 5 stars had they had this.
__label__5	Hands down one of my favorite restaurants! The staff is incredibly attentive. The food is amazing! We go at least 4 times a month! They always have some of the most talented musicians in the city. I recommend this to anyone who is looking for great food with an even better atmosphere.
__label__5	This is an excellent restaurant the food is outstanding.The owner is very pleasant and accommodating . And service is also very good. Highly recommended
__label__4	"Just with any other Ross, it's the luck of the draw! I do find that this store's soccer jerseys don't get cleaned out as fast as the other Ross's; I found the super rare USA centennial jersey here a few weeks back.

Oh yeah, there's a super cute girl here named Ania (Anya?). she checked me out when I bought that jersey."
__label__5	"Amazing library especially since it is very spacious. I recently rented the Nook from there and thought that was a neat idea to rent e-readers. 
I always looking forward to going there to pick a book or a new movie. The personal recommendations is nifty and I picked 'Murdoch mysteries' based on that, which I thoroughly enjoyed. If you live in this area, do stop by and find this awesome paradise of knowledge."
__label__3	"The ice-cream was ok. The lady wasn't all that friendly. 
We asked if she would divide the portion size into more than one flavor since there are so many & she wouldn't -- why not, you're already getting our money. ?? 
So if you're interested in sharing or trying more flavors go somewhere else."
__label__2	Used to love this place but the food has gone seriously downhill lately (last 2 months). New menu is not good and what were once great fries are now dried out instead. Still 2* review because location and actual restaurant still make it a good place to hang out.
__label__1	Don't understand why this place is rated so high. Last time I was there they severed the meat cold when it should have been heated up. Maybe all the drunks have impaired judgment for this place.
__label__2	Aside from the obvious fact that this restaurant needs a good cleaning, our server started off so anxious to wait on us and pleasant. It quickly became obvious that she was annoyed by any requests for service we may have made (more tea, more napkins, etc). She seemed quite bothered and it will definitely impact our decision to return or not.
__label__5	Hit these links just before Thanksgiving and epic. Lush greens and crisp air revived the soul. A  9 hole made it short and sweet. The price makes it so you can go twice a week!
__label__1	Couldn't care less about you. Inconsiderate and rude everytime I'm there. You walk in and have to fight for the dudes attention to check in for appointments. Terrible experience everytime I've gone to this apple store.
__label__4	This place is decent, in the classical American 'faux Irish' kind of way. The food is great and the selection of beer is good. I went here a few times to watch the football and really enjoyed it. It's nice, if a tiny bit 'trying too hard' if you know what I mean? I expect I'll go again, many times.
__label__5	Dang. Soooo good. Burger & fries were top notch! I had the first burger on the menu (can't remember the name) With the pretzel bun. It was amazing!
__label__3	Food is ok and delivery was fast, but I ordered a rare steak and they sent me well done
__label__5	Service was fast and easy. Miles was very helpful. I would recommend this place for quality service! I am new to St Peterburg and have been trying to find car service shop that I feel comfortable bringing my car and this is it
__label__4	Have to say, loved it!  Prefer it to the Hardware Grill, nicer vibe.  Food was excellent, waitress was outstanding.  Tried the KFC as everybody raves...good, but not going to change my life for it.
__label__5	This place is great. Small but comfy and the pie is to die for. Staff is helpful and pleasant. I would recommend for any meal but the all day breakfast is stellar.
__label__5	The food tastes like what I can only imagine is a home cooked meal, it was really fresh!
__label__4	We have never dinned at this restaurant, but we've done takeout 3-4 times - love it!  Very clean, not greasy!  This place tastes amazing, especially for being 5 minutes away from our house.
__label__2	At this point it's my fault. Going to the same location, expecting it to be better. Mistakes 8 out of 10 orders. Been going here since it opened. Don't, unless you walk in or check every bag at the window.
__label__3	Solid breakfast and brunch, especially if you're staying at the motel next door. Food won't blow you away, and neither will the service, but both are solid, and show effort. The menu is standard fare, and lands well. Nothing creative or innovative here, but they do a nice job with the basics.
__label__1	This place was lively but a complete disappointment. Host mismanages the wait list. We waited an hour. The service was very slow and the food was not good at all. I would have rather gone to Pasta Pomadoro. I think this caters to families with kids and college students - those looking for cheap eats and sacrifice food taste and quality. It's cheaper than other places on State St but you definitely get what you pay for. Bathroom was disgusting too. Felt like I walked into one of those bathroom pits at the state park.
__label__1	I booked an appointment with them and was there on schedule. When i told the lady i have an appointment and she said okay have a seat. I stayed there for 15 minutes and no one came to me. I went again to the lady to ask what about my appointment and she didn't seem to care about that. They don't value anyone's time. I had to start work after that so i just left. But they weren't  sorry about this. I have never seen someone so unprofessional and rude in my life. Awful service. They don't even deserve one star.
__label__5	"GMC Pick-up had Transmission issue ( and some other ailments) were addressed! Although the transmission was ""tricky"" I had to bring back a couple times at NO FAULT of AAMCO! Their technicians 
Got it right ( at no additional cost) Being without a car is very stressful but Both John and Scott made me a priority , very professional and mannerly! I recommend: as I will return as needed!  Thanks John , Scott ( and Team) for Hometown neighborhood feeling!!"
__label__4	I saw the Shondes at Tritone tonight.   It was a good venue for the event, intimate and held the crowd comfortably. The crowd was delightfully queer, a healthy turnout with lots of ladies and a visible trans presence. Good times, good times!
__label__5	I love Yelp!  another gem. My son got out of car and said whoa.. no way. I said trust me 5 stars I needed a cheesesteak in my life. This place is money. Service outstanding woman was so friendly. Then it came OMG  the bread was so fresh and soft and the amount of steak they give you is exactly like you would give yourself at home. If you read this review and drive up please get out of the car like I said to my son trust me.
__label__1	Saturday night at the peak of evening, and getting a parking place directly in front of the door was no issue at all. There's a good reason for that. All 5 people at our table ordered different items from the menu, and each item tasted identical to the items on the plates to each side. Apparently, they also received a great deal on blackened bacon because it was on every burger. Service is friendly but mediocre.  I've not had any alcohol to give an honest review, but perhaps I should have. It might have given the food more flavor.
__label__5	I see some negative reviews but I've always had a great experience here. Super friendly and quality work. One time I left a credit card in my shirt pocket and they called me as soon as they noticed it. I never shopped their prices but they seem reasonable. Convenient location and always on time.
__label__5	"These guys are awesome.  We used them for our move from our two bedroom apartment to our new home in Malvern.  Super quick to respond to emails, and also had the best hourly rate of all the movers I called.  They were very efficient, I don't think they took one break during the whole process.  Very respectful of our belongings as well as our newly finished floors.  

I would highly recommend these guys."
__label__4	Fantastic sausage and cheese sicilian pizza and quick friendly service!
__label__1	I was checking my bank account and they charged me more then they said it was. Also they sent me fries that were not cooked at all they were raw and cold they also sent me grape gingerale when I asked for mountain dew so I called for replacement fries and drink that never came so I called back after 2 hours of waiting and I got attitude from the lady who answered the phone and she said she'd send the driver for a refund of the fries and a new mountain dew..... shocker he never came. The food that was edible was nasty so I say go somewhere else.
__label__5	"This place rocks!   We used to pickup take and bake from Papa Murphy s back in Minnesota and for years have wished they open up down here.  I happened to stumble on this new location and we are loving it.  This is the best pizza hands down.  The staff is spectacular and the pizza is incredible.  

You simple come up the counter and tell them what you want - they make it on the spot and you take it home and have happiness at 425 degrees in about 15 minutes.

Did I mention that this pizza is incredible?"
__label__4	I discovered this place while my mom was having surgery across the street at Touro. I had seen it in passing and decided to eat there that morning. I have since been back a couple of times. The food is simple but good and the prices are very good. The chopped salad is wonderful.
__label__3	I have always loved friendlys whether it be the ice cream or the food. I went to this friendlys with some new friends from school and the service was very slow. The food was delicious but the food came out slow and by the time it got to us it was cold. However our waitress was very nice along with the other staff.
__label__1	I don't like this beauty Salon she didn't good job to my hair I want she charge me 45$ for hair cut and 95$ for my hair color she didn't do good job I show the picture but she did different color on my hair
__label__5	Great place!!!  Found incredible purse finds ... Not the cheap variety either... Coach, fossil, hobo internat'l , etc!!!  Beautiful, vintage corner shelf, new DVDs never opened,  vintage fine china .. and on and on.   Clean and well organized!!
__label__3	We arrived during a rush on Saturday morning, so our food took 20 minutes to arrive, which is a longer than I expected for a small coffeeshop. We received our coffee (above average, but nothing exceptional) within 5 minutes. The fully loaded breakfast omelette is quite good, just a touch salty. The panini is smaller than what you'd expect, given the price. Overall, a safe bet if you need to grab a bite. Wi-Fi code is on your receipt.
__label__5	Melissa in the tasting room is very friendly the original vodka was my fav. Very cute tasting room!
__label__4	"Finallyyyyyy after 3 months is St. louis i found a sushi place the meeting my standards! 
I had a bunch of sushi (nigiri), the fish was amazing, very soft literally melted in my mouth! 
(One sushi was too spicy for me)
Also had had the fried shrimp cake, didn't like it so much, it was a bit soggy. 
Sat on the bar and the service was great!"
__label__5	This is a beautiful park that is well kept and enjoyable to visit.  They have a dog park, playground, paved walking trails, and a scout trail through the woods.  The paved trails make a few small loops throughout the park and the outer one is a little over a mile and has a few small hills which adds a little spice compared to the flat trails in other parks.  The park gets crowded on nice days, but if you come early it is a great place to go for a run or take a peaceful walk in nature.
__label__2	"An OK hotel that lacks certain typical amenities. Not a vending machine in the building. No ""sundries"" shop. Very slow elevators. Once waited about 10 minutes for one. Two luggage carts for the whole hotel makes getting one tough! Rooms are modern and clean."
__label__3	Ok ok pool oooopopoopoo of them p9oop pool opopopopo0 up a bit I o ok o ok to ok ok pool room number when you're on
__label__4	It is an okay seven eleven. It is new and clean so nice to stop in. The parking lot is small and not a very convenient corner but if you need the ATM or mini-mart items it serves the purpose.
__label__1	"Nice selection of guns and accessories.  

Location is a pain to get to. Story Scranton hard to move around and if the place is busy.

Gun range service desk staff were major a-holes.   There was a big bald dude who ignored me and played with his phone and so I went to asked next guy how long was wait to get in range which he flippantly replied I don't know maybe an hour and turned and walked away.  

Won't waste my time coming back."
__label__4	First time here, met up with some friends that live nearby. Very cool vibe, good music but not too loud that I couldn't hear the conversation. Bartenders were friendly and accommodating of my love for gin! Made fairly strong drinks for a pretty decent price. Mac and cheese is must! Definitely will be returning for the meat and cheese plate and/or brunch!
__label__5	This place is amazing.  I am never disappointed.  I try to come in during happy hour for the great deals.
__label__5	Little spot a block away from Rittenhouse Square.  Mongolian beef is a must try.  Honey walnut shrimp is a surprising delight.  An inviting place on a quiet night.
__label__5	Awesome healthy lunch option! I stopped in today and ordered the grilled chicken, sautéed vegetables and the jalapeño corn casserole. The chicken had great flavor and was very juicy. The sautéed veggies were zucchini and red peppers with a sweet sauce. The jalapeño corn casserole stole the shoe for me though. LOVED that dish. Great quick, healthy and well priced lunch option.
__label__5	This place is amazing! Chris has done amazing job from the service to the flavor of the food! I will definitely recommend this place!
__label__3	Stick to the charbroiled oysters! They are AMAZING! This place was recommended by almost everyone in town. However, I think it's a bit overrated! I had the lobster Mac, which had very little lobster coupled with cheese whiz! The food wasn't hot at all! The best thing about dinner was the oysters!
__label__5	"One of the best little secrets in Boise.
The best Antipasto salad I have ever had. 
Amazing Maui Wowi pizza! Mozzarella/chèvre/pineapple Chutney/jalapeño prosciutto/arugula and Alfredo sauce!!!! 
Best food in Boise!"
__label__3	The Philadelphia locations are so much better. That's where I first ate honeygrow and was so excited for them to come to Cherry Hill. Have been there in person numerous times and ordered from door dash and the app. I feel like I'm always slightly disappointed at this location
__label__3	Come here for the giant floats. The food is just okay - pricey, too. Atmosphere is a little chaotic. Floats are totally worth it, though. It's always busy here but if you can get in at a good time, I recommend a table near the bottling area - you can watch the soda bottling process which is really neat.
__label__3	"The service is friendly and the place is clean. I dislike having a television in a dining room, but apparently I am in the world's minority on that one. 

I give the food 3 stars - except for the wonderful soup! If I only ate soup they would get 5 stars, honestly. The tom ka gai is better than anywhere else I've had in the Tampa Bay area. I admit, I haven't been EVERYWHERE... but I order it anytime it appears on a menu. The next time I have a craving, I will go the King and order a whole pot for myself!"
__label__5	"We had a great family breakfast here with 9 people. Good service. Great food and a very diverse menu with both traditional and some fun items too. 

This will become a regular breakfast stop for our family now."
__label__1	"Ordered a footlong turkey sandwich. It had only four slices of turkey on the sandwich, and four small triangles of cheese. Total rip off. 

I also said just a little ranch, and it's soaked in ranch with dressing pouring out of the end. Never going back."
__label__5	There are dozens of combinations of hot dogs you can get here. Spicy, Mediterranean, mexican, texan, I can't even remember the types. I just remember having a full stomach and delicious experience--for less than $10!
__label__1	Just terrible. I would never, ever order from here again. The cheesesteak was tasteless and the burger just fell to pieces after a couple of bites.
__label__5	Consistently Great Pizza and Pasta Dishes! Salads are Fresh!
__label__5	Carla is amazing. When asked what her favorite thing on the menu was she was honest. I eat Taco Bell a lot and I've never had the customer experience Carla provided.
__label__5	"Had the gorgonzola salad with grilled chicken, and it was excellent!!
Highly recommended!!"
__label__1	I eat OCharley's all the time at different locations when I'm in town working. I will rate this one the worst I have been too. Service is very slow (all three times I have been here) food is still ok but not worth a 45 minute wait. Don't think I will be back to this location any time soon.
__label__2	The food is just okay, service is pretty weak. Only two wait staff for the entire place. Oh and the smallest eggs I have ever seen in my life. I actually started laughing because they were so small.
__label__5	"Came to convention and saw yelp reviews.
ended up there 3 times. happy hour 2 for 1 drinks. lunch 11.50 jncl beverage. great food and killer cheesecake. in evening ask for randy and have her randy ise it for you. great personality. thanks randy."
__label__4	Good food, VERY NOISY, wait staff started well with menu/entree descriptions but limited return visits.  Only filled water once.  4 stars on food, 2 stars on noise, 3 stars on wait staff.
__label__5	My taste buds were having a party !! LOVE THIS PLACE !! Don't let the location fool you . It's a real gem!!! I ordered the lamb tikka masala which was packed full of flavor with naan which I absolutely DELICIOUS!! Hubby has his go to butter chicken with garlic naan which was also great but he kept on reaching over for some of mine. Been here several times and tried different dishes and all have been flavorful and have not disappointed. Will be back again !!!!!
__label__5	Cannot beat the price or service they provide! There are places with more amenities, but when you look at overall value you cannot beat SWA. I have used them to fly to Detroit, Denver, Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, and Vegas and they have always got me there in a comfortable fashion!
__label__5	Clean, friendly staff.  Layer back atmosphere.  The barber I had was good he inquired about what I wanted for a haircut and delivered exactly what I asked for.  Good attention to detail and took his time to give me a great haircut.   Will definitely go hack.
__label__5	This place is 2 legit to quit. Awesome menu, awesome staff, awesome patio. Definitely the place to go if you want to stay away from douchebags
__label__1	very ghetto hate this place, cashier was very rude and the tacos weren't great. We got corn cocktail and it was the worse thing of my life. Never coming back, I would give no star if I could
__label__4	"Salad bar was well stocked, as was the pizza bar.  Pizza was hot, fresh from the oven! Not the greatest pizza you'll ever eat but on a scale of 1 to 10 I would give it a 7.5.  

Tremendous value for your money you won't be disappointed or go hungry !"
__label__4	"Great Frankensause wings.   True story:   I was sitting at the bar watching the TV eating some Frankensauce wings and a huge 2.5 inch ( I measured him) cockroach crawled along the bar right by my plate near the beer taps.  Now most people would have freaked the hell out,  but that's how freaken good these wings are.  I just kept eating making sure that bastard didn't get any of my wings!    

I can't speak to more than the wings, beer and my friend the cockroach.   But all three seem to be pretty good there."
__label__4	"Brought my jeep in to fix a nasty case of death wobble.

Staff was helpful and clearly familiar with the car and this particular problem.

Prices were very competitive and I would definitely go back.

I took off one star because it took two service visits to fix the issue."
__label__4	A British style pub with good food. The pub offers an indoor and outdoor setting. We went on Sunday and with the brunch option the wait for food took an hour. The Shepherd's Pie was pleasant and packed with flavor in every bite. Overall experience was good.
__label__5	"I took my Jeep to another car wash who refused to wash it because it was ""too muddy"". There was road spray on it from some county roads, but to call it muddy is a bit of an exaggeration.

Anyways, I went to Crew who let me through with no problem, and even took the time to pressure wash the wheel wells as I went through.

The attached picture is the ""muddy"" Jeep as I was waiting in line."
__label__5	Fresh and good!  Hubby had drunken noodles and I had the red curry with chicken. Wait staff is super friendly. Will be back.
__label__3	We went for the trivia night and expected something different. I thought we would find a younger crowd but instead it was a bunch of middle aged men hawking at my friends and I. The atmosphere is pretty dive bar-esque and didn't match the vibe of the website.
__label__3	Pros: huge (if u like that), totally talented bands, rooftop. The drinks are fairly pricey for what you get & while the bartenders upstairs didn't make my friend's drink very well, I appreciate that she looked up online how to make what I requested & improvised with what she had (& cared enough to see if I liked it). The vibe here is fun & the bathrooms are clean. It's a good stop on Broadway, particularly if you're relatively easy patron to whom to serve drinks :)
__label__4	I moved from BC in September and have been putting off getting my haircut because I've gone to the same stylist for years. Really enjoyed the service, price point and how fast I was served. I got a haircut I loved and even got waxing done and I called the same day for an appointment. I saw Cathy and going back for sure!
__label__5	Do not hesitate ordering the Whole Duck Fat Fried Smoked Chicken! Best fried chicken I have ever had, hands down! It was the perfect crispy consistency, multiple layers of flavors and tender & juicy... It's a party in your mouth!!! We also shared the Bear Creek Farms 3 Day Tri-Tip, also very delicious! We did the Whole Cauliflower also which was really delicious! But the Chicken by far steals the show!!! ;-) Great atmosphere and service also!
__label__1	I told them about a major safety concern in the building, whereby people are locked in the parking garage and cannot leave, but no one responded. They clearly do not take safety very seriously at this place...
__label__5	Took a Tour with Drew. He was a amazing!! So theatrical. This is my second tour with this company. Would do again!
__label__1	"This Popeyes sucks, little cashier girl had an attitude over some honey and ketchup packets.  Like really?  Does it come out of your paycheck, do they train you to be stingy, or are you too lazy to turn around and grab a few packets while they pay you to work there?

Garbage service = garbage food = loss of customers = closing down.  I dont expect this place to last much longer.  I hope it doesn't, customers deserve more for their money."
__label__1	"My husband and I went here for dinner a few weeks ago.  We love Mexican and had been looking forward to trying the Crazy Cactus since it was so close to our house. 
We went here on a Saturday night.  I ordered the tilapia tacos.  They were disgusting.  The refried beans were dry and the rice had no flavor.
The best part of the dinner was margharitas. Go for the drinks!"
__label__5	Finding a trusted barber in the city is harder than you might think, but the search is over. Ken & co. run a great shop with an awesome atmosphere. Enjoy a good beer, great convo, and best of all a great cut. 10/10!
__label__5	Excellent food every time. We always have leftovers for at least one other meal. The veggies are not to be missed! I always get the pork and he always gets the lamb. The wines are interesting and new, and the desserts are to die for!
__label__5	"A great little spot. The servers were very friendly, the fish was fresh, and the atmosphere was quiet.

I'd put Fuji up against any of the glitzy places in NOLA. It may be a small space in a strip mall, but the food has class!"
__label__5	Try the fish chowder! It is awesome! Love the braised short ribs as well. Never had a bad meal here. The only downside is that it is PACKED and hard to get in when it is season....still worth it, though! I love sitting outside on the beach and seeing the sunset and smelling the salt in the air!
__label__4	"If you're here and it's past midnight, you know why. Need I say more. Served its purpose well and I can't complain. Fine service and very clean inside. 

Pizza options are plentiful. They do charge for ranch FYI..."
__label__5	"Ask for a Handicap room and the small bathroom issue is resolved 
Very nice and clean with lots of space and a great staff"
__label__4	Larder was delicious, and I plan on going back. Our group ordered: the salad trio (we got curry chicken salad, cold sesame noodles, and corn salad), the shrimp gyro, and the shrimp salad. All were very good. The ingredients seemed fresh and the portions were generous. The service was friendly. The only issue is the tiny parking lot!
__label__1	Placer Appliance showed up (Chris G) and was here about a total of 15 minutes and 10 minutes of it was in our bath room and then told us that he thought it might be something and the small drain in the rubber seal could be clogged but made no effort to check to see if it was and then said call LG to see if the might cover the part and then said that will be $75, wow thanks Placer Appliance...Chris G.
__label__2	Very disappointed based on the reviews.  I ordered a single on wheat; the bread was dry and tasted like it's been on the shelf a while.  The meat was decent but rather small.  Not worth a second visit for me. Tip: order a double on regular bread, hopefully you'll have a better experience.
__label__5	Delicious food, great drinks, and really really amazing serving. Miguel was the best server! We ordered the fajitas texanos and fajita quesadilla. It came very quickly and so did our drinks. Will definitely be back for more.
__label__4	I ordered the Eggplant Parm and I got it as takeout. It was very  very good. And I think the price was really good for the portion size as well!! I'll definitely be back!
__label__3	Come for the Pho... stay away from the sushi. The sushi order took forever to come out and they made a substitution without asking!!! Mediocre at best. Expensive. Did I mention SLOW? My friends were almost done eating their soup before I started eating!! They said the Pho was very good. The service was indifferent.
__label__5	Come for the kebabs, stay for the awesome garlic dip and jumbo inflated pita. Falafel is made fresh. Every kebab is great.  Shrimp skewers not over cooked and a generous portion. Various flatbreads that we will have to try.  Pizza for fussy non adventurous types- but you are missing out on great Middle Eastern food!  Servers very friendly and always willing to bring more fresh out of the oven pita.   Soon expanding to other locations in Edmonton.  Worth the trip to North Edmonton.
__label__3	The pastry rates 4-stars. The lattes 3-stars. They are not bad -  but to foamy and warm as opposed to hot. They had great looking King Cakes - but you had to order a King Cake the size of my head... I couldn't have out it away - although I considered trying.
__label__5	These massage store was amazing place!i would like give them 5stars always!And I will go there again when I got free.
__label__4	Literally ate till I could not eat anymore.  The Sunday Gravy had me sleep for hours!!!  Slow but worth it
__label__5	"Always fast service, fresh food, great selection and the owner Ming is as awesome as it gets.  He recently, in his own handwriting, marked every dish on the menu whether it was steamed or fried.  Thats just awesome.  It is all VEGAN, but I take carnivores who also can't get enough.

LOVE IT.

Make sure you get to the sunday dinner buffet for the best all you can eat asian selection in the city."
__label__5	Dropped of my car for some routine service and to talk to a mechanic about a potential issue with my vehicle. After a few quick words they decided to take care of the issue with zero cost. Fantastic service, too! Everything was explained well and they took pride in being professional.
__label__4	I have not used this establishment's services but when I called for a bid from Geeks 2 You, I got an immediate response and an offer to come to my house that day.   My communication with them was great and they were very responsive to questions.  Worth stars for professional business practices because it's something I've found you can't always count on in this field.
__label__2	Just too darn noisy on a Saturday night. It doesn't know what it wants to be. Restaurant? Rowdy bar? Dance venue? Food was okay. Servers were hustling. Can't imagine why I'd go back except the groupon we had was a good value.
__label__1	Short & sweet, I will never do business with Bob's (Greenwood IN) again & would never recommend them. All about the sale, customer service non-existent, zero accountability, just plain junk. They sell what they don't have & months later they still don't have it. Never again, one & done. Won't surprise me in the least when furniture starts breaking & I won't even attempt to use rip-off goof proof. Stay far far away from this place.
__label__5	"In a search for the best pizza in New Orleans, I found myself at Mo's to test its long-standing reputation of making an excellent pie.  It didn't disappoint.  The ingredients were fresh, and the dough had an excellent flavor and texture.

It certainly does compete with some of the best pies in New Orleans."
__label__5	Our waiter Rich was EXCELLENT.  We had the Bison Filet and a Delmonico - both cooked perfectly and very tasty. Waiter gave excellent recommendations and was good to us.  We can't wait to come back!!! Recommend the spicy coffee rub and bison nachos.
__label__1	We are here for an important soccer showcase; student athletes are competing for college scholarships.  Little did we know there would be music blasting until one in the morning.  For our lack of sleep we are being offered a breakfast voucher.  If you prefer not to have music blaring outside of your room until 1 am, then I suggest you stay somewhere else.  This is a disaster.
__label__4	"Ok so we were really excited to try this place.
I ordered tom yum with tofu. It wasn't the best Thai place I have tried. The food had too much oil. And something was off about the dish. 

Next time I would want to try the pad Thai, because my friend liked it. 
Other than that it's a cute place, inside of the Santa Barbara public market. 
Thai iced tea was perfect !!!"
__label__5	We dine her quite often and have never been disappointed. By the way did we mention they have the best clam chowder we've ever had.
__label__5	"This place is so fun! The drinks are great (albeit a little spendy) but worth the novelty for sure. The Hand Grenade is a must and my husband ended up getting some sort of gator drink.

When you order the shark drink, they blow whistles, ring the bell and scream ""shark in the water!"" which is hilarious. Live music is great and the bartenders were super friendly. Definitely worth a stop if you're on Bourbon street."
__label__5	"I went to Quality Windows after an unsatisfactory experience with another glass place in town.. Quality Windows staff (especially Espy) is amazing. She is knowledgable, friendly and willing to work within customer's parameters. I appreciated Espy's following thru exactly by the time she said she would.  Quality windows also happen to have  the best selection of glass products in Santa Barbara (as far as I know).
I am looking forward to doing more business with this company."
__label__5	We always take our clothes there for alterations and have never had a problem, including husbands suits, dresses, blouses, pants.
__label__1	Very bad experience with Maple Small Animal Clinic. They told me I needed to euthanize my dog -- got a second opinion, got appropriate treatment, and now she's happy and healthy. STAY AWAY!!!
__label__5	Can't go wrong coming here. You will definitely not be disappointed!! We've come here alot and love everything we've had. Staff is always super friendly and they have the food out in no time. There is limited seating available so you can dine there. Located right in the same plaza as Panera and Cookie Munchers.
__label__5	Most amazing deserts ever. Really good lunch items as well. Sandwiches and quiches! Small little place but very busy cuz of how good everything is.
__label__5	This place... Words cannot describe how much I love California Tacos. Their burritos are perfection; the tacos are incredible. I've never had anything I didn't like - seriously. I have brought many people here (because this place is addicting), and they've always been impressed with their food. I could go on for a lonnnng time telling you how great it is, but it's honestly best to try it yourself. You won't regret it.
__label__5	Who reviews an airport breakfast nook? I do, after exceptional service from the two guys there. Very funny and nice. Great La Colombe coffee and suprisingly good everything bagel.
__label__5	Great find in the New Orleans area for when you're looking for something new to try. Everyone working there was also friendly and helpful when we ordered and didn't quite know what everything on the menu was.
__label__1	NOT late night food, kitchen closes at 11 pm.  Appreciate the referral to Oreillys Pub.
__label__1	I was second in line. After explaining  what i needed Made me wait in the hot sun for 1 hour whithout telling me if the job can be done or not.  After asking many times he nonchalantly tells me just go somewhere else and started working or another car. Never again.
__label__3	I used to love Zea's and would go there for their Asian almond shrimp and Thai ribs (with a side of corn grits of course). But I've noticed that lately their ribs are more fat than meat so I've been eating their twice-cooked duck, rotisserie chicken or their fish dishes. Their duck is awesome but is the most expensive thing on their menu. Don't bother getting any of their rice dishes since it's crunchy rice. Their desserts and homemade brew are good-especially the Clearview Ale.
__label__3	"THE GOOD: pancakes, hashbrowns
THE BAD: The waiters just don't care at all, they are going at 100mph and there is no moment to even complete your sentence before they are leaving your table. 
The coffee and the hot chocolate were so bland.
THE MEH: The dishes - they are just okay really. Just okay - I can make the same at home."
__label__5	I love this restaurant, the food is always fresh and excellent! The staff and Ryan treat every customer like family! My favorites are the Tempeh tacos, chicken wings, the duck is very scrumptious along with the salad that it sits on. I highly recommend  you to give this restaurant  a try out on your next outing.
__label__5	Such a wide variety in both cold and hot teas, and the staff even helps out with recommendations... probably my favorite tea place! And now they have tea flavored ice cream!! Amazing!!!
__label__4	A great place to get your car fixed. There are quality mechanics such as Brian and the owner Kaleel. They ensure that your car is fixed with good parts and provide good advice for the proper maintenance of your car. Their prices are 95% of the time cheaper than their counterparts. Check them out if you want your car fixed right.
__label__3	The location is great.  A block from the ocean.  This place is relatively cheap compared to others in the area.  The room we were in felt like a cave with minimal windows and light.   We had a baby and needed some assistance.   The staff was indifferent.   Their breakfast has no hot items.  Its an ok place to stay to get close to the ocean and main street.
__label__4	"My girlfriend and I had lunch there yesterday.  She had the crabcakes and I had the taste of New Orleans. 
Her crab cakes were terrific the best we have probably ever had. My food was good as well the red beans and  rice and shrimp creole were terrific however the étouffée was not to my liking. 
Great service. We had had several drinks that were awesome however they were very pricey. 
3 drinks each and lunch cost $146. 
I still highly recommend this place!"
__label__5	"The team put on a fun event that featured some great bbq from around the Midwest and beyond! Great on-stage entertainment. Lots of availability seating, much of it in the shade. Great desserts from local shops and some fun activities.

We took the pup and he had fun too!"
__label__5	"Outstanding. 

I've thought about moving to Florida so I could hang out here more...no really, I have."
__label__5	Not a bad place to have to kill some time of you're delayed. Katie was awesome! Made my frustrations of be bf delayed 3hrs much more bearable!
__label__5	The seafood burrito was awesome. Filled with tons of fish and shrimp and mango salsa. Delicious! The view is gorgeous and the servers were quick and efficient. Defiantly will be going here again.
__label__3	Hmm I didn't try that many things here, but I didn't think what I tried was that special. They do have lots of options and lots of things look good, but I'm not sure if they taste as good as it looks. Perhaps I need to try more things here for a better review.
__label__2	Th first time we went to this place was amazing. So we decided to go again for the second and the food  wasn't consistent . Lacked flavor and customer service was bad too . My husband and I are not coming back to this place .. sadly
__label__2	Mediocre at best. Take out house Low Mein was tasteless. Pad Thai was noodles with a little chili spicy sauce with a few shrimp, no tamarind taste, no bean sprouts, no fish sauce taste, no peanuts, no tofu. Expensive for what you get, Shrimp egg roll was just OK.
__label__1	I could go on forever about how this place deserves 0 starts instead of 1. Save yourself the trouble, literally live anywhere else. Didn't know apartments could even be this bad!!!
__label__5	I eat breakfast at Spencers every Wednesday, Friday and Sunday morning. I have made so many new friends since I have been going there. The waitresses are awesome and the cooks are great. The friendliest place I have ever been. Breakfast is now my favorite meal.
__label__4	I love their steak and shrimp combo.. The prices are very reasonable .if you want something compared to kobes..this is the place.. Same type of cuisine.  I loved it. I will visit again
__label__4	"Pretty good. Food is dece. Nothing to write home about. Just good hit-the-spot breakfast-lunch fare. Big portions of every kind of super-sized breakfast/lunch daily. Huge caloric
Feast. You'll sleep like a baby after grazing at this Feed Bag. Servers are on the slow side, however they're very pleasant and friendly.  Hey, did i tell you about the serving sizes!  Uge! Bigg ! Really XXXL! Maybe the largest cofefe... ever."
__label__5	Tom yum and lemongrass beef were fantastic! One of the best thai restaurants in the country. Ask them and they'll bring the heat!
__label__3	Unfortunately, we were disappointed.  we ordered the gyro plate, and while the portion of salad was large, the meat was not real gyro meat.  In other words, it was not the beef, lamb shaved from a rotisserie you should expect from a Greek restaurant. The gyro meat served to us was the processed, pressed slices you would buy at the grocery store. The actual Gyro sandwich had the same flat slices.
__label__5	"There's no reason why this place should have the three star rating because it's brand new and everything here is amazing. The music and food has way more variety and the owner really cares for the customers health and well being! 
Read Dr.Suess- Green eggs and ham"
__label__3	Fun atmosphere.  Great service.  Food was okay.
__label__1	$27.50 for two watered down mojitos. Should have stuck to beer!  Staff was friendly but the specialty drinks suffer.
__label__2	Food is good , however service is the worst in down town Nashville. We got the wrong order, and it took 20 minutes to get a server.
__label__1	Food isn't bad but the customer service is horrible. The Asian lady with long hair at the counter not only had a lot of attitude, but walked away from us when we were in the middle of asking a question. The lady had so much attitude that it ruined our lunch here
__label__1	"First experience I had an ok pedicure and terrible gel manicure. I picked off the gel polish easily in just 2 hours (a new record). 

Since this location is conveniently located I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt and went in for another pedicure. Since the pedicure price is so cheap, you get what you pay for! The paint was more on my skin than my toenails. I could have done a better job myself."
__label__2	We ordered a pizza tonight and when it showed up as we were eating it we noticed it was two topping that we paid for. What a shame!
__label__4	Stopped in on a Sunday night when the line at that other place across the street was ridiculous.  So glad I came in to Felix's.  Raw oysters on the half shell were fresh, large and expertly shucked.  Also got half doz or the oyster du jour which was a fried oyster and it too was outstanding.  Grabbed a hurricane and pimms cup and had an amazing time.  Highly recommended this place is.
__label__4	I've only been here a few times but my gf and I went Friday night to celebrate my new job.  We got there and it was our waitress's first day on the job.  She did extremely well.  She kept our drinks full, the food was extremely good, and the restaurant was clean.  The only think that was a little bit of a disappointment was the price.  I think 30 bucks a person is extremely steep but that's just me.
__label__5	Best little spot in Santa Barbara to get your Turkish coffee fix and smash your face into the most delicious Turkish delight everrrr. Takes be back to my Israel and Istanbul travels. Thank you for the reminder of my vacation days ...
__label__5	I would not go to anyone else but Lindsey...she is a magician that can do wonders with your hair! I would highly recommend her for your all extensions needs!  I have shoulder length hair and she's been doing my extensions for over 5 years! I'm so hooked ..go see Lindsey! 5 stars
__label__5	My wife and I had our 9th anniversary at The Cheesecake Factory. The hibachi steak is one of my favorite dishes there. Unfortunately my dish has a piece of plastic in it. We let our waitress know and they handled it in a professional manner. They didn't charge us for the dish but we still insisted on paying for it. Things like this happen, but I would not give a bad rating, due to how quickly they handle the situation.
__label__5	I had no idea I even liked monkfish until I ate here. Service was excellent and the food was all interesting and delicious. My whole family enjoyed it, from my younger brother to my grandmother. Something for everyone in a cool/hip atmosphere. Superb drink menu as well! Enjoy!
__label__4	One of my favorite breakfast spots in the city. Yolk offers a bevy of options for whatever you're craving, from basic to unique. My personal favorite is the Cinnamon Roll French Toast. It's served with a cinnamon roll on the side with cream cheese icing. Delicious. The service can be a little hit or miss, depending on the crowd. However, the food and atmosphere make up for it. You're likely to spend  $11-15 on breakfast, but I always leave satisfied that I did.
__label__1	I just ordered Shanghai fried rice cake to take out for my lunch. The moment I opened it, I found a piece of metal (probably from the metal ball cleansr) in the food.  Lost my appetite right away.  I threw the whole order away because I didn't have time to bring it back to the restaurant. I had to work. Totally disappointed.
__label__5	I've had 12th Street Catering several times and have worked events they are catering and every time I am impressed by the food. It's always delicious and beautifully displayed. The staff are also great and easy to work with! I love this place!
__label__1	PODS recommended this service provider and should discontinue their association with this company. PLS was absolutely the worst moving services I have ever used.  The packers they sent had no concept of packing a POD, wasted space, didn't seem to care about our belongings and brought nothing to protect the home. Search the internet and find a local mover with good reviews to get the best service. DO NOT USE PACK & LOAD SERVICES, INC.
__label__5	The salon itself is is super cute and has a great atmosphere. My 1st visit was for a mani/pedi and Mary had me so relaxed I almost fell asleep. My second visit was just as fantastic and I absolutely love my fun little flowers! I have found my new go to nail artist/studio!
__label__5	This place is amazing. Food and service was great. Customer service is on point. They replaced our grill since it wasn't working and they kept our drinks cold for us. I would definitely come here again especially since they have birthday specials !
__label__5	Go here anytime. Intimate sanctuary from the chaos of Bourbon. Great food, yummy beignets (Without the wait or crowd of Cafe Du Monde), and lots of drinks. The music here is top notch!!
__label__5	My family used Truckee Meadows Cremation when my father passed away 1 year ago. All of the employees were very kind and considerate. They took a lot of time explaining what would be needed and the process of cremation. When the time came and they picked my father's body up from his house, they were so very kind and respectful. They carried out our wishes perfectly. They called us when they started the cremation process so that we were able to think of our dad as he was cremated.
__label__1	I take issue with an employee and manager giving my wife grape alcohol when she asked for grape drink. This is a violation which makes me very angry.
__label__1	the service is really slow and the place is just dirty. The food was also not good.
__label__4	This salon is a great value! I had a great experience with my student: I came in with an idea of what I wanted, and she made sure to ask questions along the way to confirm the style I had in mind, as well as provide advice and suggestions. I took about 3-4 inches off to get a shoulder length bob with some light layering, and my stylist did an excellent job meeting my requests and being professional. It was only $16 for a shampoo, cut, and style. I'll definitely return in the future!
__label__5	Bought a great pair of red wings with my boyfriend. Megan explained each product really thoroughly and helped him find the perfect fit, sole, and style he needs for work. She's also hilarious. Will definitely be back
__label__4	"The most comfortable movie seats ever! I love that there is a leg rest. 
The lines were a tad bit long to purchase tickets. I suggest purchasing your tickets ahead of time through Fandango and using the automated ticket machine to disperse them. The theater was clean and the temperature was comfortable."
__label__5	Since writing this review I have gone back twice, once to the new one on West End, and once again to my convenient drive through on the way home. Happy to report they got both of those orders correct. You cannot Hugh Baby's!! My Hugh Baby's fix is back. And I mean once you go, you'll definately go back!!!
__label__5	Went here for the first time this past weekend and so glad I did! The food was yum and you get so much! I see why my friends kept talking about it! The owner Edmin? Was really nice too and checked up on us and made sure we were happy with our meal. Great customer service and food !
__label__3	"Mixed bag here. Had lunch with a group of eight. Half the group enjoy their meal, the other half found their food over cooked.

I had the chicken fried chicken and it was very good. My body had the pork chop and it was overcooked and tough. Heard a lot of good about this place, and was hoping to have more positive comments."
__label__5	First time here! Why have I waited so long? I work in downtown St. Pete.  Sat at the bar for lunch.  Enjoyed a blackened salmon salad. Two pieces of salmon and the price was $11.99. I have lunch for tomorrow, too! Very impressed. And Jami H was a wonderful server!  I'll definitely be back soon!
__label__5	Love it here! The wait in the line is totally worth it!! LOVE LOVE their pretzels!! Tranzilli's has been apart of my life since I was a kid! Always been good!!!
__label__5	I am late posting this, right before christmas, I stopped here by accident! I was very impressed with the food and service. Small but nice and perfect. I went to Chickie and Petes but they had this wait due to Covid so decided to just try this place. I am so glad I did, I am a fan! Will definitely be returning. I had a  the handcut cheesesteak sandwich and OMG the chips were homemade, you will Love them! Try this place!  You will not be disappointed!
__label__4	This place has a great selection, though some more rotation would be appreciated.  The staff is wonderful though and I highly recommend stopping by for some decent bottles.  I would like to point out the irony of the reviewer who complained about their prices and subsequently suggested consumers look to the horrifically overpriced beer distributor on Montgomery ave.  Come on man.
__label__5	We came here 3 times during our stay, breakfast/ dinner/ drinks. Each time we came, the service and food was top knotch! The food is fresh and quality. The drinks are strong and unique. We were hoping to meet Mr. Hogan himself, but the merchandise and old WWE videos playing inside were great!
__label__5	"Chris was a great cook and entertainer. Best show in Reno. ""Security!"" & ""Butter-fly"" were famous phrases. His spice was right and we enjoyed the experience. Wi"
__label__5	This place has great breakfast and unlimited toast?!? Say less! Highly recommend checking it out, never been disappointed yet.
__label__5	"My favorite Greek restaurant in Tampa! You can sit inside, order take out (they have online ordering), and you can also order delivery through Uber Eats or Amazon Restaurants if you're feeling particularly lazy. 

I highly recommend the Classic Gyro, Chopped Greek Salad, Trio of Spreads, and the Greek Fries. All are equally delicious! I love that you're able to customize your gyro with add-ons, such as the Roasted Garlic Feta, which you can't do at the other Greek restaurants in town. Definitely check this place out!"
__label__5	I have lived in the Wynnewood/Main Line area for 25 years! This is without a doubt the best! Fish is as fresh as it gets! Sushi is awesome! Prepared food has been a g-send on those nights...! Love the produce as well. The owners are lovey and accomodating-steam lobster, beautiful seafood platters, ask  & they will try to make your wishes come true!
__label__5	I've been going to F45 for about 2 months now and it's by far the best gym I've been apart of! The atmosphere is so upbeat and positive and the trainers push you in an encouraging way! The workouts will kick your butt but somehow seem to fly by and I'm already seeing results! I would recommend anyone looking for an incredible workout to try f45 New Tampa, you'll be hooked!
__label__5	Their work is so incredible. It is truly art what they do. I see the owner everytime and I have never seen anyone as thorough yet time efficient. My nails don't look chunky of super fake. They are as close to flawless as you can get. Also, they color selection is insanely huge... in a good way!
__label__5	Spur-of-the-moment Thursday night dinner out in town; Chris and crew NAILED IT!!  Fabulous from the suggested apps to the unreal desserts.  Thanks for another great experience.
__label__3	Slow service is the norm.  Worse when all flights are on ground hold for weather.
__label__5	"Nice location to hang out for a couple of hours and just enjoy nature. 

Birds, squirrels, ducks and geese, all surround the lovely little lake. Fishing is allowed here. Wonderful and large covered area for picnics under the gazebo with tables and chairs. 

Not sure about restroom situation, haven't used so can't say. 

Very relaxing place to go. 

Lots of little gnats and bugs sometimes so be aware of that. 

Overall, a very relaxing place to chill out."
__label__1	Cigars are wayyyyyy overpriced. $20 for a $8 cigar in my local shop. Rude workers and very insulting.
__label__2	Don't understand the good reviews. Falafel was very dry and flavorless. Hummus was bland, had a weird texture. Yogurt sauce tasted like watered down sour cream. Staff is very friendly and welcoming.
__label__5	Learned so much about Mardi Gras on this little tour-it was so fun! We got to try King Cake too-yum! Definitely worth the money. The tour guide we had was very knowledgeable and loved his job, which made it a great experience. I've always said I will never go to New Orleans for Mardi Gras, but I'm convinced I have to do it at least once
__label__3	"They make a competent sandwich! I was actually pleasantly surprised at the speed of the drive through and quality of the sandwich. Are they going to be the best ever? No. Will it be pretty tasty at a good price? Yup. 
We will definitely come back when we dont feel like driving to Capriottis for a cheesesteak this will be our go to."
__label__1	Never got any food! Waited 1/2 hour just to have people come in after us be seated before us. The host said that they had reservations and to that I said GoodBye!
__label__5	The food was amazing here. We had a great time. They gave us $25 off for my fathers birthday which made him very happy. They were very careful since we ended up with three people sitting at our table with different food allergies (Only one person from our group but it was kinda crazy we all ended up at the same table). Overall we had a great time and I look forward to going back.
__label__2	"Mediocre food.  Noisy, cramped.  Waitress was tapping her foot for me to leave my booth after dinner, so other people could be rushed into my seat.  Very rude when I can both see and hear her.  
Basically, a place for cheapskates.  Not my kind of place."
__label__5	great little inn super close to the water. Lots to do around there- close to restaurants, the funk zone, etc. Our room was great and really quite large- there was a fireplace, a small kitchen, the comfiest bed, and more. The man at the front desk was very lovely and let us know about the complimentary wine and cheese in the lobby area which we very much enjoyed. Overall a wonderful place to stay.
__label__4	Great fresh wasabi! Get it. It's actually the real deal. But they close at 10 am on Sunday despite their Yelp info, just FYI
__label__2	it was our first time in santa barbara, so we went to opal for dinner based on yelp user reviews.  however, we were disappointed with the service.  as we were getting ready to leave,  the waiter adjacent to our table noticed our frustration and offered to take our order.  the food was good, but this restaurant lacked a personality with an unimpressive italian decor.
__label__5	"Walter was extremely helpful in finding the wire ( and finding the reason) our HVAC system kept shorting out.
Honest, Reasonable, Exact and extremely efficient.
If I would have listened to previous companies, they'd have made me buy a whole new wireless system... AND I'd have not uncovered the REAL problem.
This company, and the ones who represent them go above and beyond.
Thanks to u all ."
__label__5	The owner is always super helpful and kind to my 9-year old Pokémon card collecting son. My son tells me they have all the rare and special cards he's always looking for.
__label__5	I have been coming Kathy, decided to give this place another shot since it's so convenient for me.  I LOVE HER!!!!! She knows exactly what I like and she always takes her time.  Her massages are the best after a long day on my feet! Highly recommend. Cash tips only!
__label__5	Shawn and Rebekah provide excellent service. They know what they're doing and care about their customers. This is just exactly the kind of auto repair shop anybody would feel great about having service their vehicle in the right way.
__label__5	I took my wife on the historical tour for her birthday and it was fun and informative. Although we live in St Pete we weren't aware of as much of the history as we learned. It's the best way to cover 8 miles and see a lot of the downtown area. We'll definitely do it again and maybe even take a kayak or paddle board tour of the coffee pot bayou.
__label__2	I am truly not a fan of Green Eggs. I find their food to be extremely average (with exception of the Red Velvet pancakes). To me, there is nothing special about this breakfast/lunch joint. I had a BALT that was well done, but nothing extraordinary. Their breakfast dishes are too over the top and gluttonous for me (can't believe I am saying that). Additionally, their portions are huge and my sandwich did not keep well for leftovers. There are just so many better breakfast places in Philly that I can't justify another Green Eggs visit.
__label__1	Very horrible service I was hung up on 4 times trying to check my order. I was called a 5 year old by an employee named Brandon and the manager is unfit for duty.
__label__1	I am taking legal action against HCC.  If you've had claims from HCC MIS denied, please follow me on Twitter or on Facebook.
__label__5	Everyone is so nice and friendly. I have been coming here for years and won't go anywhere else.  There's no where else like it!!
__label__5	"Dont let the strip mall deter you.  Amazing sushi and hibachi.  CLEAN!  Great staff.  Food is phenomenal.  Beautiful interior.  

Go there.  Now."
__label__5	One of my favorite places for beef ribs in Santa Barbara! With the combo options, I can add either tri-tip or marinated charbroiled chicken to a plate with rice, beans, and either corn or flour tortillas! It also comes with pico de gallo but I like it without(personal preference). The salsas are amazing as well! The tomatillo is my favorite. I like to cut up the tri-tip and makes tacos out of them.  I've been here many times and will continue to comeback!
__label__4	I have GE so almost always get precheck.  Lots of people in the regular line and now shunted into the precheck line that are clueless and that slows things down.  Also precheck is only open for a few hours in morning.  The rest of the time you get regular check with shoes.  Good news is that is never takes more than 10 minutes to get through and usually less.  I fly out of TUS about 20 times a year.
__label__5	Mother's Day lunch wad spectacular. The service was outstanding. Everyone was polite, and the servings were HUGE. We had to finish everything at home because our baby was tired. Otherwise, we would have finished everything at the restaurant. Excellent service, serving sizes and very clean. I loved it.
__label__4	We have stayed here multiple times and again the suite that we had was very nice. The location is the best. Check in was a little slow and the room was not ready. You  would think that when we arrived he would have called to get it ready. The front desk staff was not that helpful or friendly. The bellmen were always friendly and ready to assist.
__label__5	I don't know where to start.  My friend suggested that while in NOLA Commander's Palace is a must.  I prefer more casual spots but decided to go along.  Best decision ever!  The place takes you back to another era.  The food was amazing, but the best part for me was the impeccable service.  Our servers Josh and Phillip were wonderful! Make sure to go upstairs to the garden room as it is bright and airy with beautiful views of the oak trees.  A must do while in NOLA!!!
__label__5	We shared a few items between 3 people as suggested by the waitress. Everything was very good but we ordered another salad Togo because we weren't quite full. Overall the food and view are worth a second trip.
__label__5	"Googled best french dips in stl and Snarf's came up. I'm fairly picky about french dips the bread has to be right (a little crusty) melty cheese and tender shaved beef. ..not to mention the gravy (one time i was served french onion soup as au ju...not cool). This place killed it all by far one of the best I've ever had. 

Ps do not get the cole slaw it was narsty!!"
__label__4	Best breakfast in Reno, hands down! This place is so unique and everything truly is made with love, just make sure you aren't in a rush because it usually takes about 2 hours in total.
__label__5	Clam chowder is awesome.  The food was great  the service was excellent. Everyone was very friendly.
__label__1	This was my first time here, the customer service is terrible especially from the male that calls himself a manager with the worst attitude and very disrespectful   I didn't catch his name and i doubt he is even a manager. Will not be returning the smell is awful!
__label__4	"Wonderful food and service, they go out of their way to make you happy. The view is nice too. 
But I hated how they add the tip of 19% to the invoice with the option of raising or lowering. Tip is a tip it is not supposed to be part of the food experience. Very unprofessional."
__label__4	Returned to Mahalia to see the musical, Sweeny Todd, and everything went quite smoothly. No long line or waits at all. I like that you can hang outside next to the pond after you scanning your tickets. I also really appreciated that this production had subtitles. Really helped me understand the story.
__label__5	This was recommended by a friend who lives nearby. We went in around 10:30am for brunch on a Saturday. Party of 5 total and took about 10 minutes for a table. Everyone really enjoyed their breakfast items but I was different and ordered a lunch item. Now I've had plenty of decent burgers in my life but this patty melt was off the chain great! Maybe this was the best one I've ever had! The prices were good and the service was on point. If I'm ever back in town I will order another one.
__label__5	Excellent service. Incredible atmosphere. There are some pricier items but we ate relatively cheap and had a great meal.  Tuscan chicken pizza was delicious and the bread they serve before the meal melts in your mouth.
__label__5	Love this place! Cameron was the awesomest server! Cant wait to come back! He recommended the calamari and cheese and ale dip and they were the bomb diggity. Also his knowledge of beer was amazing and he helped me find a beer when I didn't know what I wanted.
__label__2	"Sadly this baskin SUCKS!!! If you're okay with the standard/traditional flavors and NO NEW FLAVORS, then this is the place for you. Even though, they ran out of gold medal ribbon too. I know that flavors very by store, but this store only has two freezers and even THEN they arent full. Someone needs to be better about ordering product.
On a positive note, the staff Is always friendly and helpful."
__label__1	I give this restaurant a zilch but had to give is something to move on.  The staff doesn't give a hoot except how much work they have to do.  They aren't the cleanest bunch and neither is the restaurant.  At 5:00 the salad bar was trashed and completely empty of most items and disgusting, the ones they did have were mixed with a bit of every other item.  They only care about orders to go and cranking them out.  This location has been this way all the years its been here.
__label__5	My wife and I decided to try Poke King, found out the food is all raw and left.  Walked across the lot to Hawaiian Time, first time there.  We both ordered the Huli Huli Chicken.  The wife opted for the small plate and I had the regular.  The cashier was fantastic and friendly and the food was great.  The marinated chicken was wonderful and the macaroni salad was great.  We will definitely be back.
__label__5	So many different choices of proteins, mix-ins, and sauces. We got a bowl and tacos. All of it was so good.
__label__4	Great concept. Buy wine and cheese in the store, then small plates in the garden. The food is quite good, but unfortunately many dishes, patatas bravas, trout, pasta, are overly salty.
__label__5	Decided to stop in here before going to Mercury Tattoo (an amazing tattoo studio around the corner) and tried their 1/2 dozen empanada box. My daughter and I got a variety to try, but I must say the Korean empanada was AMAZING. It was so good we decided to order the full dozen box to go for when we were done getting her tattoo finished to take home!
__label__4	Tried for the first time.  Ordered the orange chicken, crab Rangoon, and house fried rice.  All were delicious and what I expect from ordering Chinese take out.  Called in and picked up the order in 15 minutes!
__label__1	I saw a good-value car on the CarValue website, called, was assured the car was available and made an appointment to see it.  When I got there, after driving over an hour, I was told the care was having work done to it and not available. Seems to me a bit of bait-and-switch.  Either was, a waste of time.
__label__5	Freddys is a new favorite of mine.  With the 255 construction closure, I pass the Collinsville location going to and from work daily.  Sometimes my car just goes on autopilot and somehow I end up in the drive thru!  How does that happen?? I love their food; my order has never been inaccurate.  By the time I get home, I've eaten almost all the fries. Sorry hubby!
__label__5	After having a horrible experience at star steak and lobster, I decided to come here and all I can say is wow! We were immediately greeted, seated immediately and the food came out quick! My waitress is a sweetheart I believe her name is Jonna. The food is great! Definitely come here the place is nice and the staff is great.. The food speaks for itsself.. YUMMY!
__label__5	I love this place. Best Mexican food ever .so fresh so gooood. Specially guacamole is very very good. Thank you. Definitely come back
__label__5	"My previous fav pizza changed owners & went down hill (no names). Finally found a new fav!  (it seems that should not have been so difficult, but involved quite a bit of trial and error). 

Very happy with the food, cleanliness, cheerfulness, location and service."
__label__4	I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered special off the menu, the chef had no problem accommodating. It was delicious hot and fresh. See my photo. Best airport food I've had in memory. Service was very good and fast!
__label__2	Descent food but TERRIBLE SERVICE!!!!!!!!! 7:30 reservation and it is now 10pm and we still haven't received our check....
__label__5	Awsome sandwiches. I had a Drs appt across the street. Saw this interesting deli on the corner. Ordered 2 of the best sandwiches for my son and I. We will be  going back.
__label__5	Best empanadas I've ever had, hands down. They are delicious, handmade, everyone there is really friendly, warm and inviting. I dream about these empanadas.
__label__5	I've been coming to this restaurant for many years and whenever I visit Reno even though it's only about a three and a half hour drive from my house I just must visit this restaurant. The food is truly outstanding and the waiters are very friendly and very funny. The service is very fantastic and is very polite.I have no recommendations specifically because I'm sure that whatever you order will taste outstanding!!!
__label__3	"So glad Mt. Juliet has another coffee shop now. I had a latte both visits. To me the flavor is on par with Starbucks. Of course people have their own ideas about what a good coffee shop should be. I would classify this as more of a chain, but so far they have delivered, at least what I like. 
Cons. Service seemed a little slow,.
Also, I paid with a card in the drive thru, and she handed me a clipboard to sign my receipt. They could stand to update that system in my opinion."
__label__5	You'll find us here almost every Saturday morning! DELICIOUS latte! Marie steams the milk to perfection, it almost tastes like liquid toasted marshmallows! Dawn makes the best fresh fruit salad ever (because it is not full of yucky cantaloupe and honeydew melon)!
__label__5	Nathaniel was AWESOME! We're from out of town and he recommended the best spots for us to visit! Also, we loved the environment!
__label__2	"Where to start.. My Caesar doesn't even come close to tasting like a Caesar and the chicken looks like it's been sitting for days. The guy behind the counter taking my order has a ""F this place"" attitude. He literally tossed my order onto the counter and didn't speak to me at all, and he got my order wrong."
__label__3	For a steakhouse - I would not recommend at all! The food is decent, but I  would recommend if you want a good atmosphere and friendly staff... I suggest sitting in the bar area  having oysters (delicious) Caesar salad and a few drinks to enjoy the ambiance.
__label__1	System was down, not much options, wanted Danish, said there was none.  Employes by target employees and manager that is very clumsy and doesn't care about anything.  Customers had to take up and order what was left, not in mood to confront anyone there.  Very lousy example to other Starbucks with no reputation.
__label__5	"The best sandwiches in ... the country. Or at least a strong contender. Their breads are fantastic, and the ingredients are very high quality. Also, their flat-bread pizzas and desserts are almost uniformly excellent. Great cookies. Easily my favorite inexpensive dining location in Tampa.

4/8/07: Best cookies I have ever had. Flourless chocolate cake was also incredible. I wish there were a place this good in Boston."
__label__3	"Good to go with friends and taste different kind of beers.
The food is not bad but it wasn't my favorite. They serve free popcorn and pretzels."
__label__5	I've ordered Mirko's Pasta from UberEATS twice and am official OBSESSED. Tasted 5 Star. Arrived piping hot both times. I have tried two different types of ravioli (the butternut squash with rich cream sauce was truly divine.) Both incredible. I can't rave enough. This place is very reasonable for the quality. Yum
__label__3	Not bad - good value & clean. We've stayed here a few times and it's always very comfortable. New microwaves & frig in every room. Lots better than other budget spots in the area.
__label__5	This place is amazing!  All the staff were very friendly.  The place itself is new and the decor is very nice and modern.  I felt very comfortable there.  They have all the latest nail techniques and are good at doing it all.  I will continue to come here even though it's further from my home.  It's well worth it and the prices are competitive.  Tracy did my nails and she is the best!!
__label__5	Carlos did a phenomenal job refinishing our hardwood floor in the master bedroom. They were extremely professional and reliable and the finished product looked like a totally new floor. I highly recommend them.
__label__5	So delicious! We ordered the seafood linguini, fettuccine with shrimp, grilled chicken salad and tiramisu.  Everything was so flavorful and the portions were generous. We will definitely be back next time we are in Carp!
__label__3	I ordered the Shrimp and Grits Napoleon. It had way too much sauce and not nearly enough grits. The sauce tasted good but because there was too much of it, the dish really took on a soupy consistency. The little bit of grits in the dish were delicious and creamy, but the dish really only had a tiny amount of grits (I'm talking like 3-4 tablespoons). If there were more grits and less sauce I think this dish would have been a home run, but as it stands it was a bit disappointing. On a positive note, the service good.
__label__4	Great pizza and service!  Try the roasted duck pizza, you wont regret it!  They also have a wide variety of beers.  I wish they had guiness and a personal size pizza option.
__label__5	We went to the location on Royal street. Cutest little hole in the wall!  Perfect hot and sugary beignets and lots of other things on the menu!  Going back before we leave!
__label__5	Best Donuts Ever!!!! This corner donut shop isn't kidding when they say Best Donut Ever. The donuts literally melt in your mouth! If you are anywhere near downtown St. Louis, you must, must, must grab one of these treats!!!! The staff is super friendly as well!!!!
__label__4	Great food, great price. The tamales are amazing & I usually go specifically for them, though I have had their tacos & quesadillas, which are also very good.
__label__5	The cupcakes were amazing! and the service very nice and professional. Family own business, home made from scratch= freshness . Highly recommend it
__label__3	I ordered the chicken sandwich which came with 2 good sized pieces of chicken. The chicken a little on the tough side. My friend ordered the bbq pulled pork which he seemed to be happy with. Staff was friendly. I would order the pulled pork next time.
__label__2	This gym has a very odd layout. I signed on for a year at the gym given a decent discount they give to my employer. The gym has multiple levels and some rather outdated workout equipment. The Wi-Fi connection in the cardio areas is terrible, and if it is busy, and you will likely not have a Wi-Fi signal while working out. Also, they get about five channels on the cardio TVs, so if you do not like CNN or ESPN, you're out of luck.
__label__1	This was absolutely the worst Chinese food I have ever ate in my life the sweet and sour chicken taste soggy the so called fried Rice was Rotton no pork are vegetables in it all it was horrible I couldn't even eat it I spent 25$and she wouldn't give me a penny back she has a sign I never noticed till I wanted my money back that says no refunds that's because she knows how horrible the food is they steal people money and can't eat there garbage food very bad experience I would had gave it 0 stars if I could had
__label__2	so, im not sure why, but every single time i call to place an order for pickup, they person on the phone always lets out a big sigh and and yells to ask someone else whether or not they are taking pickup orders....
__label__3	The staff is friendly but not very knowledgable on products. I visited for specific items and while shopping needed assistance. I spoke with several employees and unfortunately questions were not answered. I searched the internet search for support and got the answers needed on the products. Now I do thorough research prior to store visits to be sure to have the ultimate confidence while shopping.
__label__3	When they first opened we were very pleased with their delicious pizza. It was just perfect crispy crust, perfect amount of sauce, and cheese. Unfortunately these last few times of ordering from there the dough seems under cooked or maybe it's to much sauce but it is soggy and flops over if you try to hold it. Lately it's been a big soggy mess. Kind of dissapointed. Hopefully they will go back to their old recipe and then I can increase the rating.
__label__5	This place is awesome, we had lunch at La Ruas and they told us they owned this place too. The food is great and the owner  is really cool. I wish we had them in San Diego!
__label__5	"Nice?  Twice as nice!!

What a delight to find dozens of different flavors available on a warm summer night!  Very impressive selection of amazing flavors that everyone in our group had two different flavors!

Service was great and very kind!

LOVE this place and will go out of my way in the future to visit!  Superior quality and extraordinary flavor!"
__label__3	"The four star average surprises me.  I like this place...it's a Dogtown staple for sure.  I definitely see it as more of a ""hang out on the patio and drink some beer"" sort of place, rather than a place I go to be all excited about the food.  The burgers, which seem to get rave reviews, are pretty meh.  The buffalo chicken sandwich is almost too huge.  I don't hate it, just don't love it."
__label__5	Fantastic! I have been dealing with printers for years. Devilfish Ink goes beyond the call of duty. Great turnaround. Extremely creative, custom artwork. We keep coming back. Thanks for ALL you do!
__label__5	The food is great but Azalia and Riley really made the experience incredible! They were so friendly and made us smile and laugh the whole time. Good staff, good drinks, nice atmosphere. We will be back :)
__label__5	"OUT OF BUSINESS.....Riverview store, also.

This location did not surprise me......TERRIBLE location to get out of most the day, parking almost non-existent & set back out of sight of traffic.

Will, truly, miss them."
__label__5	I absolutely love this place and they treat you like family. When I'm sick, they'll prepare the best ginger soups and tea and I always feel better it's become my new remedy during cold season. I also am a huge fan of their Thai coffee and Thai tea! The coffee is absolutely delicious and it's rare for their menu but it's the perfect caffeinated beverage! The Panama curries are absolutely delicious and if you want good Bangkok chicken  look no further. There's honestly nothing on the menu I wouldn't eat and you've gotta try this for yourself!
__label__2	The food is just okay and the inside is smaller than average pizza places.
__label__5	Our special place to eat when in Overland ,they have the friendliest staff and food it delicious every time we are there. Normally I have my favorite the Grande Chimi but tonight I had the Parillada Mexicana and boy oh boy was it a treat. Shrimp, chorizo,chicken, beef fajitas cooked with peppers onions and mushrooms served with rice and beans. Such huge portions I had leftovers for lunch the next day. Hubby had the fajita taco salad and really liked it.They have a full bar area and are also family friendly.
__label__1	Lady named Julianete Leauxe completely ignored me and asked me she won't serve me till I have played and I have spent $40. That is more than enough for a drink Jesus. Learn to pay attention people saw her completely ignore get me so if she just gave me my drink no problem then I would not have made a comment but to question if I have spent money here is absurd.
__label__5	There is no better bookstore in St. Louis - no, Missouri, perhaps the country.  Period, end of sentence.  Well, except I have to say, what makes an independent bookstore relevant, is the people that work there, and the owner of this store has employed people who are IN LOVE with the written word.  So they know what the hell they are talking about.   Go to Pudd'nhead.  Spend your money there - you will be a better person for it!
__label__1	Disappointing. We are a family of three. We purchased all of our timed tickets online in advance as the website said and when we arrived at the attractions on time we still had to wait 30-45 mins past the time on our ticket to participate. The hayride was nice but uncomfortable. You sit directly in hay on the bottom of the cart. The train ride was the longest wait. We waited 45 min past the time on our ticket to ride the train and it absolutely was not worth it. There is a very nice selection of pumpkins and pies. Apple blasters was the most fun.
__label__1	"Very disappointed! Terrible place! DONT GO THERE! The website looks nice but the place is terrible! 
1) they don't use disposable nail files! This is terrible and dangerous!!! 
2) i have never had  ingrown toenail but now i do!!! Thank you very much! The guy didn't know how to cut it! It is all inflamed.
I hope i will be fine soon because if i need to go see a doctor they will have to pay for it."
__label__3	I tried the fish tacos a few months back and LOVED them, simply prepared and tasty... However, I went in recently and asked what kind of fish they use and they said it's 'basa vina' also known as Swai, a cheap, Asian imported fish- Why on earth (other than to save a little $) would you serve this unhealthy, imported fish when you are located in the Harbor where the wild caught, local fish is plentiful??  Please, at least consider using a cod or something similar?
__label__5	The chicken sandwich here is amazing. Spice level is spicy but manageable, fries beyond good and fair prices. Recommend hands down. (Located at Fat Bottom brewery)
__label__5	Nice & quiet even though it's just an exit away from the airport! I'm pretty sure this was the cleanest room I've ever stayed in, too. I noticed how fresh the sheets smelled and even the towels seemed very new. I had such a pleasant stay, I knew I had to post a 5-star review to thank their amazing staff. I'll be back.
__label__5	This is my favorite breakfast place. My kids and I love all of the food. It's clean and the staff is friendly. I've been many times and have always had a great experience.
__label__2	It's not that the service was bad or anything, the food is just not good. The hype for this chain is something I do not understand.
__label__2	HOW IS BUCA OUT OF LASAGNA???   We went there yesterday for a Business Holiday lunch looking forward to some Lasagna and they told us they were out!!!!   They had just opened.....how are you out??  Plus it was freezing in the area we were in, and they never offered to move us to another area that was warmer.  We ate with our coats on and never had Lasagna.  Good thing the dessert made up for it!!
__label__4	A new restaurant at Clay Terrace in Carmel, Prodigy burger has a good location and great patio. Their menu has a lot of burger options. Their Wagyu burgers and GOAT options are both good. Quality French fries and other sides. There are a lot of milkshake options which gives the unique difference from other burgers places. Service is good, never have issues with it. It can double as a sports bar with lots of TVs, great for seeing a sporting event.
__label__4	Excellent lunch spot (have never tried breakfast), atmosphere is super friendly, and the food is made with care from scratch.  I've been to Dish several times with several different people, never once heard a complaint from any of them.  The sandwiches are simple but tasty, the daily specials can't lose, and there is a good selection of mainstream and obscure natural sodas and beverages.  Try the soup or the quiche of the day!  Downside: Parking is difficult, as it shares a building/site with several medical offices.  Also, it can get very busy at lunchtime.
__label__4	The sandwiches are a delicious mess.  The prices are just a little high for a straight take out restaurant.
__label__5	Can't go wrong with the unlimited appetizers, sushi, and hibachi for $19.99!! Had 5 different specialty rolls that were all delicious!! Will be back again next time I have a sushi craving for sure!!
__label__5	Joyce is a delight!  She's informative, smart, warm, funny, prompt, and efficient, just what you need for a tour or airport pick-up in New Orleans.   She doesn't just drive you around.  You get an in-depth tour of the area with Joyce's commentary and lunch at a restaurant only patronized by locals.  What else could you ask for?
__label__1	Great location. Class and teacher is good. However, the studio is very unprofessional. They give you promising when they try to sell the package. After that the small extra charge come along the way. 15$ / 10$ add up here and there without notification. I never write any places bad review before. Sadly this place is the first one.
__label__5	This is my main hangout spot. Why you ask? Hermanaki wings and beer selection. By far the best wings in the city and a beer list that's always updated and new. All you need in life.
__label__1	"I found this place by using YELP ADS, and they are not what they promised to be. I am disappointed in Becky's Bakery as well as YELP ADS for sending me to this awful place.

As far as BAKING GOES let me tell you something: YOU NEED TO USE MORE FLOWERS."
__label__5	Great Jersey diner. Clean, affordable and you'll never leave hungry. The staff is always great. Fuck Phil Murphy! Go here, get something good, and be happy knowing that South Jersey ain't North Jersey.
__label__2	"Not really my kind of food.  I thought the hot dog would be more sensational, but it's really just a  skinny little not very good hot dog smothered with a lot of stuff including a bready roll and a  lot of beans and i don't like beans.  

The flan, however, was delicious - but kind of steep @ $3.50 for a little piece."
__label__3	"You can't bash or hate-on Ashley if you're looking for affordable furniture without the seedy experience a lot of affordable furniture places offer.  It's in a great shopping center close to everything with tons of parking.

Inside there's a generous selection, especially of sofas.  If you like synthetic leather and microfiber duos, this is your place."
__label__5	The food is always great. Whether you eat in or order to go the sushi is always fresh and tasty.  They have lots of choices and their hibachi is great too. It is nice that it's a byob too.  The staff is very friendly.
__label__5	"Very professional. Great staff will to help. Thanks guys
Wait time was easy. Very pleasant staff. Overall for DOT physicals ,and DOT drug test I would recommend this place"
__label__5	This is most definitely the best breakfast place around! We come from Boston to Dunedin every year and this is our spot! If the food doesn't get you hooked the staff will, Eva is amazing and so friendly! They make you feel right at home.
__label__2	These guys aren't too friendly, but at least they don't care enough to try and sell you on extras. They are normally stone faced until you slip out of your car and try to check out their lil' underground lair, that's when they get real emotional.
__label__5	The best vets I've ever been to! Reasonable, in fact almost cheap! Very very knowledgeable. Lots of stories and and a very great team! Use them!
__label__5	"A much needed addition to the NOLA bar scene.  Obviously they have whiskey, whisky, and more rye whiskey but what's a bonus is the great atmosphere and attentive bartenders.  Were out of one of the bourbons I asked for, but shocker, there were tons of great alternatives.  

They need food, but the food truck outside does the trick for the time being.  

For those of us that like to add cubes ourselves, they also need ice tongs...but still it's fabulous compared to what we had!

Definitely coming back!"
__label__4	Tried the new pool menu yesterday. It's served out of their Airstream trailer, poolside. Great tacos, homemade salsas and the ceviche is to die for. It's a fun urban oasis. Really affordable, too. Check it out!
__label__5	"A few weeks ago I had to put my dog Abby down, it was a bad day from getting a speeding ticket, a flat tire, and coming home and finding my dog unable to move.
I immediately called the Strickland's.  They took such care and feeling for what I was going through that day, it made the difficult day bearable.  They took a paw print from Abby and wrote me the kindest card.  This is exactly why as well as many other reasons they are a great vet."
__label__5	BBQ is amazing. Ample portions of meat and sides. We both had burnt ends. They were larger cuts than you normally see. Mac and cheese is awesome and my husband said the jalapeño Mac and cheese was too. The loaded potato salad was my favorite side. Couldn't finish it all and wished I could. Nice people. Outdoor seating. Highly recommend!
__label__4	"Fabulous breakfast burritos ordered and picked up this morning. Great service and their salsas were fabulous. 

Imagine the burrito and it can be made! Favorite was the carne asada."
__label__5	Food was excellent. Hog fish sandwich with pineapple coleslaw what is outstanding. Might want to make a reservation on the weekend.
__label__5	I've used A&S twice now after a co-worker highly recommended them. They are a super honest family owned business that does high quality work for reasonable prices. I can't recommend them enough!
__label__3	Very friendly and attentive staff, and good location and atmosphere.  Only 3 stars because of the value.  The omelet was almost 9 bucks and tiny (and overcooked) with bagged home fries.  Classic Diner charges roughly the same and is twice the size (and it's delicious) with homemade home fries. My wife's omelet was coldish inside and even the cheese was unmelted.  Will give it another chance though.
__label__5	I love this place.  You feel like you've been planted in a Jane Austen story. Everytime I go there I wish I could live there. It holds all sorts of enchanting things. . . a beautiful greenhouse that you can get lost in like a labyrinth, giant water lilies, sculpture gardens, a rose garden, a cactus & succulant garden, beautiful fountains, and paths through the woods where you can sit on a bench under the shade of a tree and look out into the peaceful forest.
__label__5	We have loved coming here since Kathy purchased the restaurant.  The food is great, daily specials are good too.  The atmosphere is fun and neighborly.
__label__3	Just Average... Were here for Easter. Service Very good. Menu, nice variety. T-bone steak, very bland. Needs more seasoning and a nice sear on it. Salads, boring... Chicken Carbonara, not much flavor. Banana Foster, very good. Coffee, Excellent. Prices are fair. Has full bar. Food needs more seasoning. Just not much flavor...
__label__4	Really cute coffee shop in the Society Hill area of Philly. Outdoor seating, tons of different types of teas, and strong coffee.  Lots of veggie options and soy milk is readily available.  Glad to be able to support a local business that is treating their customers right.
__label__4	"Always a good pick.
Huge menu, really too big, but always something for any time of day and any person.
The appts and cheese cake are always my two favs.
I usually can even skip a main encores and just get them.
My top picks for apps
Cuban rolls
Corn Cakes
mac & cheese balls
buffalo blast
Cheesecake
Red velvet
Pumpkin
Key Lime"
__label__5	Holy Moley!!!!!  These mini Bundt cakes are amazing!!!    They are so moist!!!  My fave is Red Velvet.  But why not get a dozen of assortment?  That's what we first did.  You can order online or over the phone.  They are also offering curbside pick up.  Extremely easy!  We've been twice in one week
__label__5	"One of my favorite places, it's close to campus yet it's still a very calm place. The interior is very cute and clean. The workers are very friendly and they have a ""stars program"" which is basically a rewards program: you receive a star for every time you go and after you collect 10 stars you receive a free item. They really only have drinks, no snacks unless you count boba as a snack but their menu basically only consists of tea in various forms."
__label__4	"This place was amazing. Solid beer selection, solid wine selection. I didn't try the food, but it all looked fantastic & made with great care. The bar staff was all very nice. So much seating, indoor & outdoor. They also had board games for customers to play while they enjoy a beer or wine. 

Anytime I'm in town, I will do my best to visit this place. Fantastic."
__label__1	Idk what the hype is about this place. Food tasted like a little kid made it in a hurry and the service was rude and slow.
__label__5	Everything we have had is amazing. Pizza is thin and you can taste all the roping. The salads are gigantic and it says for two but that's two people eating only salad. Huge portion. Garlic knots are awesome
__label__5	Me, my family and boyfriend are regulars. I love their food specially their sushi! It's so good! Never had any complaints or concerns. I'll recommend this place to anyone.
__label__2	After eating Hattie B's I was expecting great things from this place. It was awful. I got the plain. My husband got hot. We both thought it was flavorless! No wonder the place was dead on a Saturday during lunchtime. The people were very friendly and the bathrooms were clean but it just wasn't worth it.
__label__3	Avg at Best ~ I wanted this so bad . . . We need good BBQ in Tucson.   This is not the answer.   Greasy, fat chunks still in meat, lacking authentic smoke flavor.   I'm so sad.  Look it's avg dine out food in the OV.   Good Bar ~ Lots of Options.   Potato Salad was sloppy wet with Mustard.  Nice view from outside seating.  Clean.  Quick.  I want so bad to like it.  Sorry.
__label__1	A true disgrace to all CJDR dealerships. Sales staff treats returning customers like absolute garbage and your service department stinks. Embarrassed to say we once bought a car here.
__label__5	One of the best happy hours in midcity Philly, they have the best appetizers and drinks a large selection of draft beers local and micro brews and the fried rice app is excellent with an egg on top of the Kobe hotdogs are a hit as well. Stop by they extend some of the happy hours as well so you can't miss it , they also have another bar in the back if you don't feel like sitting indoors.
__label__4	definite YES!!! Kyoto never seems to disappoint. I love the decor at this location, the private rooms are awesome!!! The food is great with a lot of variety. I love the bento boxes and the chicken/beef bowl. Very flexible with what you can choose with the your combos. Ill go there anytime! Good service as well and fair pricing. Definite fan.
__label__5	Very friendly and for the price the food is exceptional. The tamale is better here then the Mexican restaurants in town. I'll be back
__label__5	I was very happy. The repair was faster than expected. Even when I had a little glitch it was quickly resolved in my favor. Love the place. It saved my IPad
__label__5	This place is the best.  They don't have an oven on site, but bagels are made fresh every morning.  They deliver to all the cafes on the avenue, so if you're eating bagels on the avenue they come from their flagship location on south.  BAGELS are always fresh! So happy that this hidden gem is here.  Much needed quick grab and go.  For all the reviewers that say bagels are stale, really have no clue what they're talking about.
__label__5	The team at Maintenance Magic was fantastic! They confirmed the appointment the day before. Arrived on time, and promptly completed the requested task. I will be hiring them again for my handyperson tasks. They do everything from plumbing, painting, remodeling, and everything in between.
__label__4	This was a fun afternoon out with the family.  I hadn't been to a go kart track in years, and now I am wondering why not.  The establishment was clean, and very well run.  I didn't find the time too taxing, and the system in which the process racers through is very efficient.  The staff was all super helpful, and polite.  The best part is they have go karts that my 8 year old can drive, and that made this a very memorable experience for him.
__label__2	Finally tried this place after walking by many times. Wish I hadn't. It is very inexpensive and you definitely get what you pay for. The food wasn't horrible, but it was bland and just tasted cheap. The best way I can describe it is that it tasted like someone described to them what a burrito was and they winged it without ever trying a real one. The only way I would recommend this place is if you were very hard up on money and just looking to put inexpensive food in your belly. I will not be coming here again.
__label__5	Delicious! They took extra precautions during COVID times. We started with the Feta cheese appetizer. OMG good. I had the Gyros Melt with lemon potatoes. Ate every bite. Took home some Spanikopita! Staff was very friendly and amazing. Will absolutely return! Highly recommend.
__label__4	Stepped into a wonderful design showplace that would beat some retail stores. The whole store would be a dream closest. I am not really into contemporary fashions which are too pink and girlie for my taste but there were different styles and colors I was willing to try. I found a cute summer dress. Definitely will keep an eye out  for this fashion vehicle around town.
__label__2	My kid loves the macaroni and cheese and fried chicken but my food came late and the food was not so great. So definitely a kids favorite but not mine
__label__1	"It has been 4+ years since the digital TV conversion and Channel 13 WTHR is the ONLY over the air  station we consistently cannot pick up without the hassle of reprogramming my electronic digital antennae.  

The result.  We seldom ever watch it. 

 All.... And I mean all other Indianapolis TV stations are received fine using the same Digital Antennae setting

It begs the question.... If I can receive all other digital TV signals but WTHR..... Why don't they tweek  transmitter or put a repeater near Greenwood so me and my neighbors can watch it? 

Unbelievable"
__label__1	"Audubon says it's renovated, but the laundry center is still not working -- something they don't even update the residents on. The ""renovations"" are mostly cosmetic stuff, such as roof replacements, which might be necessary but are definitely not as pressing as a laundry center that hasn't worked for over half a year. Again, this place sucks. Stay away."
__label__5	I highly recommend this shop. My husband had been going here for 13 years,  and our son since he turned 1 year old. They always see Joe and always get an awesome cut. It's a very affordable, hometown barber and they won't go anywhere else.  Saturday mornings are packed because so many people go there. Love this place!
__label__5	Probably one of the best burgers you will find in the greater Philadelphia area! I always order the signature Cowboy Burger, and I'd recommend it to any burger lover. Be sure to also try their milkshakes, as they're both rich and very thick!
__label__4	Very nice addition to the area. The prices seem a bit high for the atmosphere and service, but I felt the prices were reflective in the amazing taste of the food. If you go for no other reason, go for the food. Everything is delicious! Don't worry about the odd parking situation. The restaurant is much bigger on the inside than it seems, so even if there's crowded parking the wait is still probably minimal. This place is good for just appetizers and drinks, large parites, or a casual dinner date.
__label__2	I agree the food was good, but $26.00 for three scallops? That seems a bit much. The dessert was a poached pear, stuffed with marscarpone, that was $9.00 and you only got half a pear.  When you leave an establishment and spent eighty buck before the tip and you are still hungry, doesn't make me want to return. Main complaint is portion size.
__label__3	"Very clean dining area. Friendly staff. Photos of food are very appetizing and are bigger than true items. Food tastes good but over priced. Understand ""fresh made"" but that doesn't need to mean overpriced. At time I went they had way too many staffers for the number of customers in the restaurant. Maybe cut back on staff could lower cost. Wish you would lower prices, coupons or stamp cards or someway to have rewards for some lower pricing"
__label__4	It's a beautiful wine and cheese bar. The portions are a bit small but delicious. You have to try the cheddar cheese, the one Anthony Bourdain recommends, it's really good! I tried Brie from France, it was tasty too,but don't expect a big slice... We ate Italian meats, 2 different cheese and bruschetta + drank 5 glasses of wine in total.It was $50/person.
__label__3	"Great breakfast food but not the best wait staff. Took about 8-10 minutes (after being seated) for me to even be acknowledged by the waitress. Then when she walked over, there was no nice greeting. Just a harsh ""What do ya want?"" This is my 3rd time eating here and each experience has been about the same. The hostess, however, greeted me with a big smile and asked me how my morning was, which I greatly appreciated. Also a ton of great menu items, just a not so great wait staff."
__label__4	"I've had two positive experiences at Dick's. Last year, I noticed the weight set I found in store was on sale, but website only. I was promptly offered the online price, which was a sizeable discount.

Yesterday, I picked up a large online order. I was promptly met, and my item was ready to take home in minutes. They even brought it out to my car.

Took one star off because while they frequently have sales, much of their clothing still feels vastly overpriced. Selection for most activities is appropriate. Was a little disappointed in the selection of football receiver gloves."
__label__1	Not good. Bad service , bad food. It's too bad because there aren't too many restaurants on the island.  We won't return.
__label__1	Oh dear! I dislike giving poor reviews but this rental company is unethical. My daughter and her friends cleaned up well but the company decided to charge exorbitant rates for small damage - much of which was not there at all. See the image.  The apartment was actually really nice but the whole process was a mess. Very disorganized.
__label__1	Every time we drive by this place there's a line out front, so we finally decided to give it a try for breakfast. It must be the low prices that are attracting the crowds, because the food isn't much of a draw. The eggs and potatoes were cold, and the toast was so dark it shouldn't have been served. Worse yet, when we asked for some that wasn't burnt, the waitress told us we should have requested it lightly toasted in the first place! Crowded, noisy, lousy service, and bad food - why are people lining up for this dive?
__label__5	"This was our last stop of our entire trip and we are so glad we popped in as we ended up joining the wine club we loved our tasting so much! Jamie & Kim were both so friendly & knowledgable. The tasting space itself is also very cute- they have a couple different sections & tables, and offer cheese plates, etc.

Definitely recommend as a stop during your SB downtown tasting!"
__label__5	"Delicious food! Lovely wine! Had a lovely cheese board with charcuterie, grilled corn, bacon wrapped dates, and dark chocolate bark. 
The atmosphere was perfect! Even with covid restrictions in place. Staff was knowledgeable and attentive. Great place to celebrate a special occasion without being stuffy. 
The grilled corn was tasty, as were the dates. 
We were able to eat a variety of foods without feeling miserable. 
Will definitely be going back."
__label__1	HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT AND MAJOR SAFETY CONCERNS. There are no safety precautions being taken at Columbus Flea market. There is virtually no space between the vendors so everyone is extremely close to each other. The website claims that masks are required however many customers and vendors have their masks around their neck or not wearing masks at all. I used to be a regular customer at Columbus but will never return based on making zero attempt to keep people safe. Please be aware of these safety concerns. I wish I knew all of this before making the trip.
__label__2	"I ordered a Philly steak. Pretty good, love the  Amoroso bread. Not a fan of the loud country music, unkempt looking employees and foul smell coming from the drink station, which caused me not to order a drink.

 I think the food is deserving of a cleaner, more appealing restaurant. This place just looks cluttered with all the jerseys and business cards everywhere. I probably wouldn't come back just because their were too many sanitation red flags waving for me to feel good about eating here. Sucks, because this is right in my neighborhood."
__label__4	I have wavy hair that looks fairly curly if I scrunch it. I was hoping a good curly haircut would bring out the curls even more, particularly in the back where it always lays a little bit flat. Sharon was great to consult with me about what I was looking for and gave me a fantastic cut that made my curls spring right up and lay beautifully! I'm really pleased, especially for the price! The salon is not fancy, but it's warm, and they have a new loyal customer here.
__label__5	The service is great. I've come here often with coworkers and the food comes out pretty fast. Gives us to make it back to work on time. Love the quality of the food. Addictive Pita Gyro
__label__5	I made reservations here for my birthday. This was a great choice. My lobster Mac and cheese was delectable. The salmon was soft and flaky. The Parmesan risotto was so good. The highlight though was the steak. It was like BUTTER. I'm from Michigan and am here visiting for my birthday and let me tell you... I'm very pleased with my experience here.
__label__5	We have  a very happy experience here to buy our new car.Even though we had to stay in Tampa overnight because of the system crush.They reimbursed us.Thanks to Keith and Jeff !!They are very very nice!
__label__2	So disappointed with breakfast this morning why would u give this to a customer like that was supposed to be a breakfast casadea I get that stuff happens but why not remake it to begin with instead of giving it to the customer like this then when I bring it to the managers attention it's almost like he dosnt care
__label__5	Came at end of lunch. Place was very clean. The staff was friendly and helpful. Salad Bar was fresh. Pizza was good. Kids had a blast.
__label__5	"Although meat prices in general are higher than Publix, I've switched due to the tastiness and tenderness of the beef.  They are very high prime!   
I started going weekly for the $2.99 anti-biotic free chicken breasts and ground chuck every Tuesday, but soon found great fish and beef.  
The produce dept. has both organic and conventionally grown items.   Prices are better than Whole Foods, too, which is nearby.  

The atmosphere with nice music, free coffee samples, and often other items to sample, like wine, make for an overall pleasant experience.  Customer service is also high."
__label__5	Reasonably-priced and vegan-friendly. Tempeh&tofu is my favorite dish, along with the collards, eggplant, and jackfruit. Not fancy, just good food.
__label__3	good but over priced. do you original Columbia restaurant in Ybor city is 10 times better... Go and watch the flamenco dancers.  I feel like the food quality at the other location is better also.  is the beautiful Are you here, though, especially if you can sit on the patio. Food is good, but it is pretty pricey... Not a very good bang for the buck here
__label__5	"Yum! Had the recommended pork noodles, it was actually REALLY, really good! The pork is unbelievable. You have to try it, you'll get hooked! 

New favourite take out place!"
__label__3	Compared to other holiday inn express the hotel is showing its age. But the front desk staff was very friendly and helpful.  I will stay here again during my next business trip just because of the staff.
__label__5	My technician Kelly Watts was amazing. My brows have never looked better. She is professional, talented, precise and very kind. I'm very happy !!
__label__5	Tried as a last minute choice, and we are very happy we did. Excellent service, and the food is nothing short of amazing!  We are locals and highly recommend this hidden gem!
__label__1	If you want to be profiled and with high pressure sales tactics thrown in then this is your place.  Horrible experience there and I was a good customer!  Over the last few years I have easily spent thousands of dollars.  I will never be back.  Folks if you are tired of all the typical brick and mortar bullcrap then send a message with your dollars and spend your money at Amazon and Neweegg who don't care who you are or how you may be dressed.  In addition they won't try to blast you with high pressure sales crap.  Bye bye Micro Center you blew it big time!
__label__1	Absolutely disgusting! We literally waited an hour for the food, and it was awful. The waitress never came back to ask us how the food was or if we wanted anything or to refill the waters. The burger was cold and tasteless, and the po boy tasted like a 4 year old made it.  There's plenty of great restaurants in NOLA, but this isn't one of them. Please, do yourself a favor, and go somewhere else ... anywhere.
__label__5	Such a happy, yummy place.  The bakery is simply massive with cakes, cookies, pastries, cheesecakes, and more--it would take months to try it all.   The deli food is very high quality.  The Cubans, burgers, ad handmade meat pies are delicious.  Something is always on special and the staff is wonderfully friendly and helpful.
__label__2	Cool looking place but didn't live up to its appearance. Ordering was confusing (you order at the counter) then they give you a number for your table. Coffee was lukewarm and not very good. It's a biscuit place so I got the biscuit French toast with mascarpone cream and blueberry sauce. I expected a little more than a dollop of mascarpone as it was a big part of the description. My husbands hash & eggs was way to greasy and really not edible. Our breakfast was $26 + tip. We won't be doing that again.
__label__5	Amazing! I came back again the next day ! The croissant French toast is soooo good! So are the cheese and grits! Staff was super friendly- just a great experience overall. They need to make another location in south fla
__label__2	I ordered curb side pickup several time. In the past 5 times I ordered they skimp on every sauce for everything I have ever ordered and my tiramisu is ALWAYS FROZEN SOLID. WHY!? STOP GIVING ME FROZEN DESSERT.
__label__3	hate writing reviews for such run of the mill places like walmart but i suppose it could be useful to someone. anyway, its walmart. theres not really a whole lot to say about it. i was there early in the morning. it wasnt crowded at all. this is definitely the smallest walmart ive ever been to. didnt really matter though; they had everything i needed. didnt have much interaction with employees. got what i needed and bounced. id definitely go back to this store if i was in the area.
__label__5	"Where else can you go buy the new Shout Out Louds CD in the Tampa Bay area? 

Oh yeah, NOWHERE ELSE. 

And yeah, I'd like to buy the CD and not download it free on the Internet where sound quality sucks.

This place is a Tampa gem. Record stores are going extinct and we are extremely lucky to still have something like Sound Exchange. Awesome vinyl selection, vintage stereos, etc."
__label__2	"Took my family here for a birthday celebration. 645PM and they were out of at least 3 entrees. The food was so so. I've seen some pretty steep mark ups for wine, but Charlie wins, hands down. 
I would not recommend this place."
__label__1	Way WAY overrated and overpriced!  Our food was ok, flavor balance was a bit off for my taste.
__label__5	Great Pizza.  I have been eating here for more then 15 years.  Food has always been good. Service has always been friendly.
__label__1	Not at all impressed with the food. Fried chicken is way over hyped. Meatloaf was bland. Service was decent.
__label__5	"I made an appointment here to make my mom happy while she was in town. I wasn't planning on buying anything or even considering something ""bridal"" for my wedding. But I appreciated the fact they had such a sustainable business model and that the dresses were extremely unique. Kelsey was so kind, asked if we preferred masks and was so kind to wear one the whole time. She pulled all different kinds of dresses, and of course I found the most fantastic off beat gown that I got to take home that day! They recommended a reasonable alteration place and overall, I had a fantastic experience and would highly recommend!"
__label__4	This is always a good option. We had sushi, dumplings, spring rolls and chicken yakisoba. The food is always tasty and dependable. Good selection of sake too.  They even offer sake flights. Has a nice feel and ambiance considering its in a strip mall.
__label__4	This place is a classic new orleans restaurant and a must go. The waiters are extremely well trained and polite. The food is amazing. It's truly an experience. It is pricy but is also a fine dining restaurant. Great place.
__label__5	I've been coming here since it first opened. I've never had a bad meal or experience! They give you a lot of food for the price.
__label__1	"Cut my hair way too short, then suggested, ""...I could wear my hair short and spiky for a while"".  No, I can't do that because I'm not 14 years old."
__label__3	"Late night food, inexpensive, good enough to be worth the low price followed up with absolutely shitty drinks and careless service.

This part of the coast of Florida can't make drinks for crap, and most of their food is garbage... but this place knew how to own the food aspect by just pricing it at a reasonable price for how basic it all is. $5.77 for a hamburger and tots after midnight is a damn fair price."
__label__4	Tacos are awesome bartender was great love it here! Everything was tasty. Go for the margarita and the fried Brussels sprout tacos they are fantastic.
__label__5	Fantastic! What a great dining experience. Operated by folks who truly love what they do. From the outstanding, friendly service to the fresh salad with carved parmesan and truly homemade pizza fired in a coal oven.  It is hard to find, it's on the backside of the mall in the corner near Dick's Sporting Goods. Not in the mall. Enjoy!
__label__2	"So I saw a lot of posts on Facebook about this place. I've lived in the area for over 38 years and never heard of Jay's and my curiosity got the better of me.  I ordered a steak sandwich with onions and was very disappointed with the amount of gristle that I was chewing on.  

Needless to say, I'm not returning."
__label__3	It's a nice bar except they only serve one kind of wine and it wasn't that good ( Beringer merlot, yuck)I'm not a beer drinker . Food was good, I had shrimp ( appetizer), hubby had tacos, delicious. The music was a bit loud. Not a place to watch sports . They have TV but their music was loud , we were watching NLCS baseball. Guess next time I'll watch at a sports bar.
__label__5	"Food here are excellent!!  Due to covid we don't dine in anymore but we come to place carry out orders a lot and food remains excellent. Owner, Peter, is nice and cheerful. They got the best fried rice in town I tell you!   Have the ""wok hey"" literally means have the nice heat and taste cooked by a wok. Last time I remember having such great fried rice was in my hometown, Hong Kong high heat kitchens. Everything on their menu are excellent!! Highly recommended!!"
__label__3	The hotel was Beautiful   the Spinner restaurant  is very Beautiful  , , Had the crab cakes not good , small , flat  and there was very little crab
__label__3	"Food is good. Nice family owned brunch place. My only comaint...if you are going to mostly serve brunch and breakfast, spend some money and get decent coffee. 
The coffee is so nasty
 I hate to go because of it! 
I saw Walmart brand coffee on the shelf."
__label__3	Had the grouper sandwich, 16.95. Wife had the mahi mahi shrimp parmesan.  Both were just average. If your looking to be blown away, I would go elsewhere. The boardwalk dining is fun.
__label__5	do a very good job with gel manicures and eyebrow threading. wouldn't want to go anywhere else
__label__5	After noticing the signs of an upcoming new Greek establishment within Trolley Square, I became intrigued. Walking into the new restaurant, I instantly noticed the family run business was providing fresh made Pita breads along with quality meats. Needless to say, within the first week of opening, I have eaten there 4 times...If you're looking for a quick flavorable option, stop by Opa Opa.

__label__5	The noodles and spring roll is the way to go! The service is not very friendly but it does not really matter because once you try those noodles, you will get over it.
__label__2	Been here twice and can't say I enjoyed it. Both times the food was extremely oily. I think the portions are a bit skimpy for the price you pay on the regular menu. The lunch specials are decently valued though. Service is slow and not too friendly.
__label__5	Note: banana split's portion size is too big for 1 person, I tried...but everything is so good and yummy here. I usually come here to relieve my stress after a week of school. One of the best ice cream spots in St. Louis
__label__2	Five stars seriously?  Had a rack of ribs. They were flavorless and not very tender. This is take out out and cash only. Seems like half of the ribs had no meat and they were hidden under the meaty ones. There are definitely better options for ribs nearby
__label__5	Brandon and his team are A+ piano movers. They successfully delivered a piano to our home without one scratch. Brandon is a great communicator and a lovely human overall. He spent time chatting with us after the job was complete and shared some knowledge to help me tackle another unrelated issue I am dealing with. Will definitely be using him and his team again. Thanks, Brandon!!
__label__4	The food was pretty good, but it didn't blow me away. Great location for groups. I'll go back if friends want to go there, but it wouldn't be my first choice.
__label__4	Sandwich was awesome.  Mac salad was just ok..  Will defiantly go here again if im the area...  They actually put meat on the sandwich instead of two slices like some cookie cutter places
__label__4	"I never had Donatos until recently, but wow! This thin crust pizza is amazing. This location was a bit crowded before the Colts game.

I had a pizza and the hot wings. Everything was hot when I picked it up. They probably have the best wings from any QSR that I've tried. The pepperoni pizza is better than comparable restaurants -- the number of pepperoni on the pizza makes it much better."
__label__5	Good menu- good mixed drinks. Fried mozz delish- excellent service. Meatballs could have been pan seared, but overall excellent on a Friday night. Good prices too, beers for $4
__label__3	"Overrated and overpriced in the wrong location.
Bagel and lox $9
Bibimbap bowl $11
20oz coke $3
Key lime pie $20/$5 slice
$1 per apple
$4 for small basket of strawberries
Avocado toast $9
The food is good and parking is plentiful but price is high. Imagine building a Harrods smack dab in the middle of 9th ward."
__label__1	"First, I looked at the website for the hours.  So, while starving, I walked all the way here only to find this place closed.

Perhaps it is out of business? I don't know, but I'm not going to risk going back on an empty tummy."
__label__5	Amazing food and great people! We moved to Lutz last July and really enjoy going to Circles. The owners - Michael and Judy are also great people!
__label__5	Absolutely delicious. The soy sauce noodles and tom yum soup is delicious. I was so happy when i finally tried this place. So worth it.
__label__5	"Excellent food. Pizza is great, steaks are great, well, hoagies are good and they are not chintzy with meat.

In about 20 years of being a customer, I have never EVER gotten bad food there, or bad service. It is a true family business: a family who works very hard, loves their work and makes great food.

I am out of the area now, but often down that part of DelCo, and I always stop in for food and to say hi!"
__label__5	I have driven by so many times and not once have I thought about trying it. Excellent food for the price and portions where on point. I'll come back again!
__label__4	Nice people, reasonable prices, delicious treats. Plus they have sporks, so that's cool. Get the Drunken Pig or the Beer & Pretzel cupcake.
__label__5	"The platonic ideal of a coffee shop--perhaps even the leading contender for my favorite coffee shop in Nashville. Great to socialize, get work done, sit outside, eat a fancy baked good, and, oh yes, drink coffee. Have I mentioned the coffee? They know what they're doing. And yes, I sound like a snob for saying this, but that sets them apart from a significant number of other coffee shops in Nashville.

Only sore point is the parking. It's limited. I bike."
__label__1	Got food poisoning here! I ordered their chicken wings.  I was violently ill for 48 straight.  Emailed them and didn't even get a reply. Clearly they are careless and don't care.  Wouldn't send my worst enemy to this place. Can I give less than 1 star?
__label__5	Having a girls day out with my mom and daughter and we're looking for a place to have lunch and support local business. We decided to try this place and were so happy that we did ! Fish was amazing !!  The service was great we had Sabrina as are server but everyone came and checked to make sure we had everything we needed !! I will be bringing my husband and the rest of my family and friends here.
__label__3	"I can't with the name. I'm sorry, I resort to infantile projection of all things stupid and childish when I see the name. I had to unsubscribe from the emails because seeing the name pop into my mailbox nearly daily made me shudder.

Nonetheless, if you need sporting good, I guess come here. I found the staff to be somewhat helpful, though I had questions about some snorkeling gear that I couldn't get much info on.  

If there's a big sale, I kinda hate the messy aisles, because people can be animals."
__label__5	We eat here every week.  The place is beautiful and classy.  The staff - Jackie, Strawberry and others are so friendly and proactive.  The service is top notch and so is the food.  While the Hibachi steak and chicken is my favorite, I have tried a few other things like the Satay chicken and is was excellent as well.  Getting ready to go now!
__label__2	They are terrible I waited 10 minutes and still no one acknowledged my presence. Originally we called ahead to see if we could get a reservation for 7 people and they said they only took reservations for 10 or more. After I was finally acknowledged they said the person I spoke to earlier was mistaken and that they do take reservations. So before even being seated already really bad experience. Doesn't matter how good the food is if they can't get their staff organized and on the same page.
__label__5	Best place in Reno to get tires, brake work and smog tests done. While Neil seems gruff, he's a sweetheart, see if you can get him to smile. I always look to Neil for good advise and the best prices in town.
__label__5	Red Robins has always had tasty burgers, and now my gluten-sensitive ass can actually enjoy them on the gluten-free bun. I want to personally give props to the manager I spoke to from this location, Michael, who went above and beyond by reaching out to me and making sure I felt taken care of when an Uber Eats order had an ~incident~ with the driver. Trust me when I say that dealing with Uber Eats customer service is a massive pain, but this guy dealt with them just to be sure that the situation was fully relayed to me. Thanks for everything!
__label__2	Super cute boutique lots of unique pieces..but the customer service sucks!! 2 employees working there neither acknowledged me the 20 plus minutes I was in there. They both made eye contact and neither of them spoke. I wanted to try clothes on didn't know if I could just walk in the fitting room. There were sales going on no one told me about them I just had to figure out what the deals were. Would rather go somewhere else
__label__5	"Quincy did an awesome job!! She was patient with me cause I didn't really know what I wanted. I would go to her again and would also recommend others to go to her. 
For me, my overall experience as well as the outcome of my hair was a 10/10!!!"
__label__5	Moved to the area and was worried about being able to get great Asian fusion and Thai food and I fell in love with this place.  The lunch menu is amazing and a great price.
__label__3	The food is awesome,  however the woman who serves the diners is very rude.   Order through doordash or something.   Avoid eating here with that rude woman who may be the owner
__label__4	My husband and I were guests at a recent wedding here.  Appetizers were good.  For dinner we both got the chicken with mashed potatoes and asparagus which was very good and I would definitely recommend.  The venue was also very beautiful and perfect for a rustic wedding.
__label__4	Visited due to the Yelp reviews. The food was good the chicken and waffles were delicious. Great customer service. Nice family owned establishment.
__label__1	Today's lunch was a hoagie, chips and soda....cost was $9. I wouldn't mind paying that if I received anything other than a mostly bread sandwich. The lack of meat and cheese should embarrass them. I can't even speak to how it tasted because it was so Spartan. I hope this was an anomaly, but not sure I'll give them a second chance in order to find out.
__label__5	"I live in North Carolina and my grandmother lives in Tucson. Her refrigerator went out and I was worried living so far away that I wouldn't be able to find someone I could trust. 

I googled repair companies and talked to a few and decided to go with Dependable Refrigeration because of their rates. But, I ended up being very satisfied with everything: their timeliness, friendliness and honesty. My grandmother felt very comfortable while they were in their home. 

If my grandmother needs to have another appliance fixed, I'm calling them first!"
__label__5	Delicious flavor profiles; both food and drink. Cool upscale atmosphere minus the pretense. Do yourself a favor and try it at least once. Tip: if you like raw oysters, order a couple...cocktail sauce not needed!
__label__4	"Great little place for lunch. Roast beef PoBoys are as good as any in town, go ahead and get the big one! I had the all-you-can-eat catfish special, but since it came with about six pieces, I didn't feel the need to go back for seconds. 

There aren't many tables, so consider takeout. We come here whenever we're in town and definitely will be back!"
__label__3	I'm ashamed I eat here all the time. The food would be pathetic if it was in the city but out here in never never land it's the best of a bad bunch. Japanese/ Chinese. A giant Meh!
__label__1	I was honestly shocked on how rude the girl taking our order was. She had a horrible attitude towards my boyfriend and I as we were going to pay in cash and didn't know they weren't accepting cash payments. definitely wont be coming back.
__label__5	Yum!! The wings were incredible! Fries were fresh and crispy. Fries mozzarella was unique and amazing! Will definitely be coming back!
__label__1	They really need to evaluate their online order system and have a cutoff for order times. I waited 40 minutes for my 8:00 pickup order, in a restaurant jam packed with people waiting for their orders for an hour. I feel so bad for the employees I know it's not their fault, but under the pressure they're aggressively yelling at customers when orders are ready. Really disappointing.
__label__5	"This is fast becoming our favorite restaurant.
Every thing I have eaten has been delicious.
Very reasonable price."
__label__1	The worst service and food ever!!! 20% gratuity on two people.. crazy. Worst part is the rat that ran through the dining room and the manager just laughed when we brought it up. This place use to be good back in the day!! Bad management bad food = not coming back ever!! You've been warned people.. STAY AWAY
__label__1	Corina was the want-a-be waitress. Very Slow Service. Food was cold.. No butter was served with the cornbread and corn.. Even after asking for it in advance. Not to mention.. After asking for it three times after the plates were brought to the table..
__label__2	I went there recently, after the lunch crowd and found the place to feel sterile, unfilled, and dingy. The food was decent, but nothing to write home about. I'm not sure I'll be returning anytime soon.
__label__4	Nice atmosphere, good food, reasonable beer prices. Good joint to go to for a chill evening burger and brew.
__label__5	"We had our first dinner at Frank Papa and WOW! 
We ordered the mussels.... excellent!
We ordered the house salad....great! 
We ordered the special (some wide noodle with wild boar sausage).... incredible!!!
We also ordered the tiramisu...ok. 
The best part was our server ""D"", she was so professional and sweet. It made our Friday night really special.
We sat in the wine cellar. We will be coming back! What a great spot!"
__label__4	Fun atmosphere and great service. The lamb sandwich is the thing to get. The chickpea soup was also outstanding. If you are over 30 you will feel old. So drink up!
__label__5	Great food at a great price. Fast delivery if you call your order in. The BBQ chicken pizza is one of my family's favorites (lots of chicken, cilantro, red onion, BBQ sauce)!
__label__5	Showed up on time. Very professional and friendly. Got all the dog urine out of the matress. Looks just like new :)
__label__4	Good quality. Busy shop with lots of technicians. Very capable techs.
__label__1	Sorry to report that the store at PHL airport is not serving authentic Philly Cheesesteaks. Nice people though.
__label__5	Loved this place! Yummy Szechuan food in a beautiful, historic setting. The ambience was great--comfy and casual. Bartenders Josh and Sean were enthusiastic and knowledgeable. Food was delicious. Enjoyed fried rice, dumplings, and fried mushroom special.
__label__5	This place is awesome! Divey, dark, and good drinks. Recommended by our tour guide on Haunted History, Matt Brown. The ambiance is chill and feels like the place you could go to on any night of the week.
__label__1	"First world problem: Well I wouldn't order from this place (location) in my life ever again even if I was starving to death. 
1. Delivery literally took 2 hours and that was after calling to check what was going on. The Pizza was ready and just sitting there. When the pizza arrived it was cold. 
2. They forgot to put Cheese on the Pizza. 

This owner doesn't care about his location and Papa Johns should revoke his franchise."
__label__4	Was introduced to this place by some of my service industry friends meaning that it is cheap and good.
__label__5	Antonio is wonderful and comforting.  I've taken my car to him several times, he has looked at it right away, and fixed the issues with a fair price. :)
__label__5	Tried the Ribs and Que for my first Tennessean BBQ and i wasn't disappointed. Very delicious and a super friendly staff. Highly recommend it.
__label__4	"Great neighborhood pub! Nice outside seating and freshly cooked food. 

I sat outside and ordered the fish and chips. The fish was crispy on outside and juicy on the inside. The chips are actually round potatoes slices and are awesome! 
The meal was so big I had to take the rest home. 

The service was really good. I was helped by whoever was working and they all made sure I was good. 

The other night I passed by here, they had an event outside for pumpkin carving and it was really nice to see their involvemet in the neighborhood."
__label__5	I always get a little nervous when it comes to buying flowers from a florist because I have relatively zero knowledge of flowers and arrangements; all I knew was I wanted purple. Regardless of only having 10 bucks to spend for a bouquet for my wife I walked anyway and was greeted by such a friendly staff that didn't make me feel like an idiot. I told them my budget and my color and they put together the perfect arrangement. I'll definitely be coming back for other occasions.
__label__4	We were very happy with all of the dishes that we ordered. Portions were huge and flavors were authentic. I would especially recommend the Sizzling Short Rib (the hor fun noodles it came with was excellent!) and the Miso Glazed Cod. The Edamame Dumplings were amazing.
__label__4	"I'm pleased to see how well they are managing to stay open during this pandemic. Their huge marquee sign says ""masks are mandatory."" All staff are wearing masks, and although the rules were a bit unclear, they did a great job not having a long checkout line by the store entrance. I really appreciated the help I received without my asking. They also had plenty of annuals, perennials and vegetables."
__label__5	"Hidden Gem!

Waterworks park sits at the North end of Tampa's riverwalk. The park is host to a bandshell, open green, river path, splash fountain play area, dog park, Ulele spring and is anchored on the North end by Ulele restaurant.  There are many festivals, events and concerts regularly hosted at the venue bringing more and more Tampa residents to the riverfront.

It's a beautiful park with something for everyone!"
__label__5	This is the best school you could ever choose to send your child to. I graduated 1996. And very proud!
__label__5	This was such an amazing experience! I had a chip tooth and Dr. Grace Harriman was so professional and knowledgeable. Not to mention did exceptional craftsmanship to replicate my tooth to look like its original appearance. Everyone was extremely knowledgeable and helpful! The facility is brand new and very clean. I did extensive research and they definitely had the best price and for the work (amazing!)Their wasn't a wait, but Most importantly which I can't Stress enough is how comfortable they made me feel and the Craftsmanship of their Work. I highly recommend them.
__label__4	Love their red velvet cupcakes...kids love to go to a real bakery!!
__label__4	Like I even have to review this place? Everyone knows it's the bomb. The Arista, Daddy Wad, Paesano, and the Gustaio are my faves. The sammiches are consistently good and the staff is very friendly. I live around the corner & this is my go-to sammich joint! Tip: plan on taking a shower after eating the Paesano - it's that messy! Not complaining!
__label__5	Captain Mitch was a great and knowledgeable guide and funny. We had a great swamp tour with plenty of alligators seen.
__label__5	This is the place to go in town for a great hot pot dinner. There's a great variety of meats, veggies, noodles, etc. to choose from and the restaurant is clean. There's something for everybody's taste and you'd have to go a lot of times just to sample everything. I haven't had the korean bbq yet so I can only speak about the hot pot. For $27, the AYCE hot pot is one of the best deals around.
__label__5	What a great place to stay. It's a pretty new, very clean building and when you  walk around the property you just feel comfortable. The staff was helpful and friendly as we checked in.. And it's a good sign that our stay was so uneventful that we did not need to interact with them much at all. The kids loved the heated indoor pool & we all enjoyed the breakfast.
__label__5	"My first order from Ricks and I am so happy to have found them. Thank you Yelp and yelpers. 
I was a little concerned because some of the pictures show pizzas with about two inches of crust before there are any toppings. I would not have been happy but no worries. Really good distribution of toppings, really good crust. Really good all around. Uncle's Boy pizza, chicken bacon salad and cheesy garlic sticks. A perfect feast for lunch and dinner on Oscar Sunday."
__label__1	I used to say I'd never had a bad meal in New Orleans, until I found this place. Our drinks took 45 minutes to appear. My gumbo was bland and lukewarm - I even had to remind my server that I needed a spoon. Spend your time and money at one of the far better restaurants in the area.
__label__5	"I've grown up in this town for whole  life and in that time I have eaten many wonderful meals. But this hot dog stand is by far the best meal I have had in years. Eat at this place not because you love hot dogs or food trucks, but because you know that every time you eat here you will have an absolutely exceptional meal.
These dogs were made from love. Cheers"
__label__3	Really lowkey vibe! Liked the TVs and tables big enough to accommodate large groups. The hot chicken sandwich however, was not really worth it. It was essentially 2 pieces of uncooked white bread with a Kraft single 1/2 melted on one piece and some semi-old chicken nuggets on it. Not really what you expect for a southern chicken meal.
__label__3	"The downstairs menu was out of my price range with no food specials.  However, the employees told me about the upstairs / bar menu.  I ordered the filet slider for $4.95.  It was a little burnt but tasted OK.  

The upstairs bathroom was around the corner up the incline - felt a bit far."
__label__4	My truck looked great after running through the main street wash. Free bug scrub that you can do before you pull in and free vacuums are nice. The price is a little high which is the reason for the 4*rating. This would be a 5 if they could offer this premium wash at a slightly more affordable rate.
__label__5	I love coming here because it's so secluded and great to relax with my daughter and my dog. The beach is overall really clean and easy to get to from the parking lot. It's less than a 5 min walk. The bathrooms are right over the hill before you get to the beach too. The best time to come here is during low tide because you can walk and run through the whole beach. To the right will be bacara and if you keep walking down the left, it will eventually lead you to ellwood. this is definitely one of my favorite beaches in Goleta!
__label__2	"We came here for lunch the other day and were given menus immediately. It took 15 minutes before someone would come back to get our drink order. After drinks were set down we didn't see anyone until at least another 15 min (seriously the place was empty) and when he came by to take our Order after we ordered he told us the cook called in sick so they could only make one thing. Ugh really?!  Why couldn't we have been notified way before? 

Also the coffee was terribly burnt too. So our experience was not great. We left shortly after with no plans on coming back."
__label__3	Sandwiches look great! First time in here and they tried to charge me for pickles??? She voided the charge, but be aware they are charging for produce. It would have been fine if they told me but she snuck it in there.
__label__5	Great place to get a wonderful Mediterranean meal. First time here, very friendly wait staff, fast service, excellent food. We will return for more! Nice, quiet, friendly, great food.
__label__5	As a Michigan transplant to the Sierras, I desperately miss my Midwestern brews. Not only do these guys have an incredible, ever-changing selection, but they're always quick to offer suggestions, reviews, etc. they have even gone above and beyond, offering to let me know if they get any new MI beers in. You just can't get great customer service like that anywhere else in Reno.
__label__2	"On the window, it says, ""Vegetarian Paradise"", yet on the menu it is lacking choices in all categories.  I suppose dry Falafel is something, but not for us."
__label__5	"We can to this breakfast place because of the reviews on Yelp. We were not disappointed.

I ordered the lemon stuffed French toast.
It came with two eggs and house sausage.
This dish was crazy good. I love lemon curd.

My friend ordered the chocolate waffle which also came with two eggs and house sausage or bacon. She loved it and said she will come back because it is the best chocolate waffle she has ever had. 

We were completely satisfied with our food."
__label__3	Good, cheap, Thai food. Pretty good (but not amazing) and very convenient with large portions.
__label__5	"Stephanie and her team are fabulous. Whether preparing for a fun event or party or just for a regularly scheduled hair update. They're all great. 
Stephanie has assembled a team of experts to make you look amazing any day of the week. She offers great packages for events so you can look great without breaking the bank. A definite must for any upcoming party"
__label__5	Absolutely love this place! Food is always so fresh and delicious. I love the antipasto salad, it's the best I've ever had. My boy friend picked us up eggplant parm and cannolis for Valentine's Day dinner and it was so delicious. Can't wait to come back!
__label__4	"I was walking by and actually noticed a Yelp sticker on the door, so I just had to stop in! If you can't find what you are looking for at Fire Finch across the street, then walk on over to Pangea and check out what they have to offer. 

Pangea had tons of trinket gifts, as well as clothing, mostly womens.  But I was happy to see some really interesting books for sale here as well.  

I recommend giving this place a try."
__label__5	Ate here years ago and had one of the best french cuisine meals I've had since ACTUALLY being in France.  Desserts were ridiculously good.
__label__5	Best falafel in town! Oh and the rose water lemonade is addictive.  Plus great market wall with imported products at very reasonable prices.
__label__5	Best Chinese food in the Reno and Sparks area hands down!!! I highly recommend, food is absolutely great! Only 1 problem for us was the roasted duck seemed to be reheated. It didn't taste fresh like others ive tried but still this place deserve 5 star as no Chinese restaurant in Reno or sparks come close to this restaurant. Truly authentic to my opinion. We're from California, where asian food is hella good but struggle in NV to find good food. You won't be disappointed.
__label__5	The best pad veggie Thai ever tbh. They asked if it was alright if the dish had eggs and it was but it's comforting to know that they acknowledge people out there with dietary restrictions/preferences. Also the Thai tea was just great, not to strong like some other Thai places. Though the spring rolls weren't the best, it's a Thai restaurant. i wouldn't expect that to be their specialty.
__label__3	Quaint little coffeehouse in Manayunk. Parking is terrible on Main Street, so if you can find parking on side roads, that's a plus. The selections are the best and they charge for everything. bagel+cream cheese + lox came out to be around $12 and if you want capers or tomatoes, it's extra fee.
__label__1	If you feel like waiting an hour and a half for warm pizza at best with a terrible chicken cheesesteak that uses processed chicken meat then order from here. This place is on my permanent boycott list.
__label__2	First time using mission Bell and I'm pretty disappointed! I got the most expensive wash that included armor all on the inside. Take a look at my pictures. They did HORRIBLE. You can tell they weren't looking for spots that needed to be cleaned, they just wiped over everything, they needed to add some elbow grease. Now I get to go home and redo it. What a waste!
__label__2	Everything name brand is considered as vintage and marked up higher. Children's clothes went up. I'm not cheap but sorry there's a reason I go to thrift shops. It's called being on limited income and raising a child. They shouldn't be able to pick and choose outrageous prices on good condition clothing and items and only make damaged goods affordable. They do run more sales than some other places that's why I gave two stars.
__label__5	A fabulous team of highly motivated, stylish individuals. I loved fashion week 2015 and cannot wait for the upcoming show! I'm so happy to see fashion related events in New Orleans, as they're not too common. Keep up the great work!
__label__5	"Unbelievably great food. Authentic Italian cuisine. Riverview is fortunate to have this restaurant in its backyard.  We moved away but still drive back at least twice a month.

The atmosphere is unique and cozy. The service is attentive and matches the excellence of the food!  I love that the Chef/owner is accessible and greets the guests in the dining room."
__label__1	Service was awful! Took forever to get a server to our table, even though it wasn't busy. The food made my husband and I sick.
__label__5	O-M-G!!! This is the home of the best food I had while visiting New Orleans with friends. Our waitress recommended the charbroiled oysters, which were a Friday night special during our visit, and they were DELICIOUS! We wanted more before our trip was over, but we were sure that there was no way we'd make it in to eat without another reservation. The Crawfish Cheesecake, cornbread, and stuffed Porkchop were to die for. Be sure to put Jacques-Imo's on your list of places to visit and eat!
__label__5	I love this place! I have been there twice. Once with a big group and the other with my husband.   The food and drinks were excellent! Great atmosphere! Servers were very attentive. It is as bit pricey, but for a special night out it is totally worth it!
__label__4	"Very athuntic. We got about 8 of the dishes and shared them. I would recommend doing that. tell the waitress what you like and she'll fill the bill. 
The floor was sticky for some reason."
__label__4	"We have been sampling the area's hot spots and and this is a killer bar/restaurant. We will go back for more. We gave this 4/5 stars because it isn't the greatest location with respect to the beach. It's a little off the beaten path and you kind of sit next to a parking lot. That said, the food and drinks were awesome and service was stellar. 
We had the peel and eat shrimp (best we've had so far...and we have high standards) and grouper bites. We would love to try more."
__label__3	I went there a year ago the view wasn't great at all but it was fun riding the boat.One thing that I hate about it is that they talk and talk and that really annoyed me. But other than that it is fun riding the boat.
__label__5	Easy, decent prices, and the vacuums are incredibly strong. They will actually rip the shirt off your back, which depending on who you are may or may nit be a good way to show off that beach bod.
__label__5	Delicious! Fun atmosphere, great food, and friendly staff. Also, the first slice of pizza I've had since my trip to Italy that did not depress me.
__label__5	My car was completely soaked from all the windows and the sun roof accidentally opening in the rain and Squeaky's saved the day! Jeff and Steven were so helpful and professional, and got the smell and water out of my car within an hour. They truly put me at ease through what would have been a nightmare. I can't recommend them enough!
__label__3	"The place is clean and not too crowded. The service is excellent. The staff is nice and pleasant. 

But the food...I ordered the Frontega Chicken Panini, which is something I order all the time at panera. The meat in the sandwich was cold. The cheese was not completely melted, so part of my sandwich did not have cheese. It just seemed that the chef rushed in making the sandwich, so the quality was not up to the normal panera standard. 

Hopefully this is just an one time experience. I would give this location another try to see how well they prepare their food."
__label__4	Well hurricane Harvey did his damage last week and now Irma is hitting Florida and the gulf coast so I don't think gas is going to get any cheaper with so many refineries  closed back east. So I stopped in to fill up my tank before the price goes up any further than it I already has. $3.10 Per gallon and I'm wondering how much higher is it going to go?
__label__2	We spent almost$50 on food that was cold. Ordered sauteed mushrooms that came with bread for $9. Asked for butter. When the bill came there was a $1 charge for the butter.  I'm surprised they didn't charge us for ketchup for the fries.  Never had a butter charge anywhere I've eaten. Ridiculous!
__label__2	Nice ambiance and very nice people. That's about it. Calamari is the worst I've ever had (and I've had a ton). Saganaki was pretty good but better when we asked for some pita to spread it on. Food took forever to come out (over 35minutes). Yes we checked the time by checking when we texted  Rest of food was good (gyro, Dolmades, Span)
__label__2	Underwhelming tourist attraction.. maybe it was better many years ago? It always looks busy since service is slow, food was edible but nothing special. So many better options on Milpas to eat a quick delicious mexican meal, Los agaves, el bahio, milpas taqueria, etc.
__label__4	Came here for my birthday over the weekend! Food & drinks were AMAZINGGGG.. And I got ice cream on the house!
__label__3	Glad we found this little sushi place while driving through St. Louis.  They have a nice selection of lunch combos which really give you the ability to get what you want for a great price.  Very much enjoyed the tuna salmon roll, but unfortunately the vegetarian noodle dish had a flavor that I really didn't enjoy.  Glad the staff was very attentive, but I felt rushed as every plate and glass was removed as soon as the last bite and sip was taken.
__label__5	The barista from Michigan was very helpful in teaching me how to do a pour over. I had the Naranja and my father had the Salvador Ruby. It was very tasty! Next time I come back to Nashville I'll be stopping in!
__label__5	Great food! Wonderful atmosphere! We had the steak salad and the hamburger- both fantastic!
__label__2	NO! :( so sad to say that this is not the flippers that I have come to love. I'm from Kissimmee and I fell in love with the flippers there. I've ordered from here 4 times, I always ask for basil on my pizza and never ever receive it, the bottom get burnt and just no... I have tryed multiple times hoping to get the flippers I love and I don't. Not a fan anymore.
__label__5	Nice to see more sporting goods in come to our South area of Reno.  This is a new, nicely organized store with some cute women's clothing and shoes.  They have my favorite brand of flip flops here ate a reasonable price.  The staff are very friendly.  Hope this store gets the foot traffic and business that it needs and that the store succeeds.  We need the diversity in South Reno!
__label__1	Horrible experience. Car was not well cleaned. When I asked to see a manager he told me that I asked for the wrong type of car wash.  When I said to him that I asked the gentleman up front what kind of wash I needed and did what he said- he shrugged and said he couldn't help me.  I have disputed the payment with my bank.  Awful. Stay far away.
__label__4	Just stopped in for the 2nd time to try the brisket. I am not disappointed. The pork steak just came off the grill and is big, tender and delicious. I highly recommend the brisket and pork steak. You won't be sorry.
__label__5	Wow! We chose Haveli based on Yelp reviews. The facade wasn't too impressive;  so glad we didn't let that deter us! Terrific service, very friendly, and the food was second to none.  Hope we get a chance to come back on our next visit.
__label__5	"Love love love, love love love this place.

Shrimp and grits - heaven. 

Fried okra - (not at all what I expected) but delightful.

Local and micro brews - delicious."
__label__1	Worst Indian food I've ever had; really not worth going. The food tasted like something you'd get on an airplane.
__label__5	"BRUNCH IS A MUST

On Saturdays and Sundays they serve brunch.  They have outdoor seating with umbrellas and large tables and if you sit outside you can bring your dog on nice days. Very affordable meals and the food is amazing. We highly recommend the huevos rancheros which are often on the specials menu. The stuffed avocado with grilled shrimp roumalade   And everything lox bagel are also fantastic. The staff is very friendly and attentive. They were more than happy to serve large groups as well. Overall a hidden gem."
__label__5	What an amazing dinner we had tonight. My husband ordered a favorite off-menu item which they were able to accommodate. I got a chicken dish with the most flavor I have ever experienced in mere chicken. The staff is friendly and attentive. The cost is a little on the high side, but for the fresh-cooked meal you receive it is worth it.
__label__5	Great staff and clean facility! Just started, but so far my wife and I have enjoyed the experience! We're in our mid-50's and this is the workout we have been looking for. Low impact, total cardiovascular workout in a fun atmosphere.
__label__1	Completely unimpressed.  We came for dessert and ordered the European fondue for two with the dark and the white chocolate.  Not only was the white chocolate all clumped up, but the dark chocolate was pretty much a cold sauce you can find in any supermarket.  To top it off, the waiter used my drinking water to extinguish the flame for roasting the marshmallows.  Don't waste your money... Not worth the $23 they charge for it.  Save your money and make it at home; I can assure you it will be better.
__label__5	I was supposed to foster a puppy from here in May 2017- one hour into fostering and I was signing the adoption papers. They work very hard to see these animals go to a loving home and I can speak from the foster side AND the adoption side. My dog came from West Virginia and probsbly wouldn't have made it without the help of this rescue driving down to gather rescues to find loving homes up north.
__label__5	New favourite place!!!!!! It tastes like when my husband and i went on honeymoon in Japan. The rice was perfect and not compact and the sushi was perfect. Everything tasted fantastic and the slices of sashimi were perfectly sized. The fish tasted very fresh too! We will be making the 20 minute drive from Fort Saskatchewan for this place!
__label__1	I I ordered two sandwiches for lunch today for pick up I haven't been here for awhile and thought I'll try them today.  I should of known since my last visit I had very dry old wheat roll, again !  Why ?  Do I constantly give them another chance hoping it was just a fluke but no it's not the sandwich was ruined.  The bread roll was inedible!!! so disappointing again. No more there's too many other good delis in the area.
__label__2	Service is so lacking.   We gave it another chance.   We really used to love coming here.  I'm assuming the Management has changed. Took SO long to get boneless wings and mozzarella sticks.  You'd think it was being made from scratch.   There are plenty of better places around here to go.
__label__5	Crowded! One of the oldest and most popular bars in the area of course it's gonna be crowded. 3 levels 3 different types of music all live bands. The rooftop is in a really good location of the city. Good to drop in for a drink hard to stay with the crowds
__label__5	Visiting Indy and found this spot. Loved it. The place is really nicely decorated and comfy. The food is great. We had the meatballs over polenta and the mac and queso.
__label__5	The Chilean Sea Bass was wonderful. Overall great experience. Enjoy!
__label__4	My wife took me here for my bday had the hot pot and Korean BBQ , it was good and ate  too much.
__label__4	I love going there for lunch .... the hibachi is pretty quick and good portions too . A pretty kid friendly environment ! That's a plus
__label__1	"Don't eat here if you appreciate good food. I dined at this establishment with my family during the lunchtime buffet. Over all; the food was cold, service was odd as there was a worker (not our waitress) that kept staring at our table (she was no-kidding sitting on the table next to us just staring), and the selection was surprisingly limited for a ""buffet"". Dessert was weird as it included canned peaches, flan, jello, and watermelon (not quite the Chinese-food experience). I'll never eat at this establishment again."
__label__4	Super cool but relaxed ambience, limited food menu, BUT the nachos were delicious.  Easy parking, too.
__label__5	The service and the food was great! They were extremely kind and welcoming. Wonderful experience
__label__4	Huge space and huge selections.  Now lobster included in weekend dinner.  The furniture is a bit old but comfortable. It offers good values
__label__5	I went to the PMA Reno for a second opinion for sarcoidosis that I was diagnosed with in San Diego. I was in town on vacation and worked it into my schedule. Glad I did, could not be happier with the attention, explanation, and opinion of my current diagnosis, what Dr. Richeson would have done himself, and what my options would be moving forward. Could not have been happier with my experience. Hope this helps.
__label__5	The best praline ice cream I've ever had! If I had the time I would've went back for seconds. The ice cream was so creamy and the pralines were absolute perfection! Next time I visit NOLA I will be coming here again.
__label__3	Was just here for a banquet style dinner. We had a full 10 course meal and I was actually pleasantly surprised. The dishes that stood out was the deep fried shrimp with jelly fish, the crispy chicken and the steamed fish. Not sure if you can get these items on a regular menu... it's one of the better Chinese restaurants in Edmonton, but overall, 3/5 for quality of the food.
__label__1	"Mailing from this company from an address in TX.  
3436 Alemeda St , Suite 234, Fort Worth, TX. 76126 regarding a 2017 Maintenane Fee Bill for a timeshare.  I have never owned a timeshare in the past, let alone now.  The letter states that I qualify to permanently eliminate all future Timeshare a maintenance Fees.     This company is not reputable"
__label__5	Just got to New Orleans, and this was our first stop after checking in our hotel. I got raw oysters, which were fabulous and huge, and the seafood etoufee with sautéed crawfish tails. Wow. I am so happy right now
__label__3	"The ""Arroz Con Pollo"" was good except it didn't come out as one big chicken breast like everywhere else I have ever eaten. It came out cut into pieces. Was it one chicken breast or not even a whole breast? Not sure. However , it was very overpriced for what I received. 
It tasted great but not sure it was worth the money"
__label__4	This was my first visit to Etheopian restaurant. I ordered platter of 8 items. I liked each one of those. The bread was really good, too. If  visit Tampa, I would definitely go here.
__label__4	Worth the wait!  Chicken is so flavorful and is so juicy!  I chose mac & cheese as my side, I prefer creamy but this was a pretty good baked mac.  The red velvet cheese is worth saving room for, I wish I could get my hands on a slice of it now!  Also, when you are done eating, you gotta get your things and go!  But I get it, seats are in demand.
__label__5	Such an amazing experience!!! On our way to San Francisco, we stopped by to eat. What we found was a gem. We had Alfredo pasta with breaded chicken roasted in oven homemade style very tasty. Also, we trued the Mediterranean salad which was super fresh and juicy. Silvano was serving us, such a great man. Everything that he recommended to us was perfect. I strongly recommend this place.
__label__4	Best place (my fave anyway) in TPA E Gates to wait for a flight, and I think it's one of the best in the whole airport. Friendly service. Good pub food, especially for an airport. Breakfast and lunch have both been consistently solid quality, and I love the Irish Pub vibe they pull off with the decor and music. Well done.
__label__3	We came in for a quick bite to eat, but weren't greeted at our table for probably 15 minutes. The waitress was friendly, but the place was understaffed. When we finally got our order in, it took over 30 minutes for a salad, a sandwich, and a cup of soup. Will not be coming here again.
__label__5	Best Hotel in STL! The rooms are larger than your avg hotel rooms and the housekeeping dept keeps them very clean. The front desk is very nice and they always provide the best recommendations on where to have dinner to confirm what I read on yelp.. Stay here if coming to St. Louis. It is the place to stay for sure.
__label__4	It's Papa John's  what do you want me to say???  I had a lot of people to feed and this did the trick.  May be better ingredients do make a better pizza?
__label__5	A must visit when coming to Nashville and for anyone who appreciates American music and its history. They have an amazing collection of memorabilia. The stories associated with Cash's personal items were very interesting. A++
__label__5	These guys are professional, and they do a fantastic job! We recently hired them to clean windows at my place of employment, and the windows are spotless inside and out. Great rates, and great service!
__label__2	"the airport is small and you cant get lost great.
the seats are dirty even at 9am in the morning. Grime and crumbs from whats seemed like 2 weeks of not cleaning the chairs.
like 4 places to eat ""for such a tiny airport"", they have a gap beween terminals that loks like a ghost town, does not seem to be in use and its even international airport (Canada flights)."
__label__4	Strangelove's is a great place to grab a beer after wrok. Good local draft selection, and many of the beers are $3 during happy hour. The vegan nachos are among the city's best, and can be had for a mere $5 during happy hour. Recommended.
__label__2	They get a 2 and not a 1 because the server and the employees in general have a good attitude.  The food, not so much.  The Ceaser Salad had so much dressing it was more like a ceaser soup.  The salmon was well done/crispy on the ends and way too 'fishy' tasting in the middle...probably not the thing to order at an Applebee's. The macaroni and cheese was decent but not great.  Perhaps if I'd ordered more traditional bar food it would have been a better experience.
__label__1	Unprofessional experience overall. Called for quote and pricing, then canceled reservation before signing contract. They tried to charge my credit card without my signing any contract. Do NOT Recommend!
__label__4	I have had the chance to visit Stingers on a number of occasions, and I've always been happy.  Great neighborhood restaurant and bar. The food is good, portions are huge and the prices are very reasonable. The manager, Andrew, is great to work with, and he goes above and beyond to be sure you're happy. I've ordered trays for parties and they've catered a large off site party for me.  Everything has always been great.
__label__3	This t bell seemed to be lesser quality than most. My burrito was almost all sour cream and no meat and it took a whole lot longer to receive than most taco bells. Also they had no space for fire sauce out front so you have to ask for it which makes no sense. And finally the soda machine was spitting out CO2 out of every slot.
__label__4	I have been a Drexel hill local for most of my life.  Pizza odyssey has been our families go to take out spot for most of my life as well. Some of my favorites include the chef salad, cheese steak, Italian hoagie, cheese fries and the quesadilla and wraps. Pizza is good too just not my preferred style (boardwalk style is my go to w/ a sandy bottom)
__label__4	Celebrated a friends birthday here this past weekend. There was a mix up with our reservations and even though they didn't have our party of 6 on the books the hostess and manager were VERY accommodating and apologetic. Managed to get us a table after a short wait. Food was great, drinks were even better. Will definitely be coming back.
__label__4	This place is especially great for drinks and appetizers!  They have some serious small plate offerings that were so good that we just had to keep ordering more.  Super friendly, knowledgable staff in a great area.  This is one of a few Tria restaurants in the city.  I have no doubt why they've expanded.  The demand must be there.
__label__3	Cheap, good when you don't want to cook. A lot of food, lasts for two days. Novio and I order dinner for two, it says $20 but it's actually $25; still a good deal. Not the best, not the worst, safe easily accessible location. Great for takeout.
__label__5	I loved this place! I was so impressed by how flavorful each item was, especially something so simple like potatoes and carrots. The lamb chicken curry was also incredibly tasty. The owner was also very friendly and she mentioned that they had won Best Ethiopian restaurant for the last 15 years!
__label__5	"Look, its old, its spooky, it most certainly hasn't been updated in quite some time....and that's OK.  Sometimes the ""cookie cutter"" hotel over and over and over again just won't cut it.

If you are up for something unique, stay a night or two here.  The staff was friendly and helpful and breakfast is pretty good downstairs.

Its worth the stories you'll tell afterwards."
__label__4	Consistently very good food. Their staff is attentive and quick to seat you and wait staff quick to acknowledge you.  The menu has plenty of choices and the food came fast. The food was just as promised and very tasty. Prices are reasonable. The only complaint I have is that they keep their restaurant too cool, I had to get an extra coat from the car.
__label__5	"Mrs. Ken is the best I've been too. Actually I went to her for my first Wax ever on my legs. It wasn't as painful as I thought. I barely felt any pain/  She's very professional and made me feel so comfortable. I only went to the European Wax Center because Mrs. Ken was away. They did good job however I felt very uncomfortable there, but I tried my best to be polite. I won't be returning to the European Wax center. 

With that being said, I will be returning to Mrs. Ken."
__label__5	This is an absolutely beautiful spot. I just moved to the area from upstate New York and he had many great reviews. The staff was very friendly and professional. I had my lips done and they are absolutely perfect! Just enough and natural! Will definitely go back :)
__label__5	The Chick Fil A Spicy Chicken Sandwich was really delicious. Chick fil A is the Great Service in the State of Pennsylvania and the City of Philadelphia.
__label__5	Amazing service and food!  We were referred by a friend and wow. From the manager to our server and hostess. We had a perfect experience. Shout out to Tanya and Tamara. Thanks. And the food was the best we have eaten in Nola and that is saying a lot. We are gonna try to eat again before we leave. We love it. Thanks you.
__label__5	Once again, Petite Chou does not disappoint. The Croissant French Toast was made to perfection and served with fresh strawberries - my absolute favorite. The brew of the day was Chocolate Ganache. Absolutely delicious!
__label__4	A friend recommended Taco Fish. Their shrimp tacos are fresh and stuffed with crispy, hot shrimp! The salsa bar has plenty of mild to spicy selections to top your tacos. Today's plate also came with a complimentary cup of bichi.
__label__5	Wow I did not expect this place to be as good as it is. Definitely my new favorite take out restaurant. The Pad See Euw with Tom Yum Soup, maybe the best 2 things I've ever eaten. I highly suggest trying them. Everyone who works there seems really nice too.
__label__1	"Bad customer service. This store is selling expired foods, disgusting foods with no dates mentioned. Bad smelling foods. When asked about the date and the expired foods the shop owner told he won't return the money instead call police and talk to him. 
when we had a issue and tried to talk about the product than the shopkeeper said he is busy watching video ignored the customer.
Rude behavior."
__label__4	We ordered takeout from here, and loved it. The curry was really good and we also really liked the pineapple fried rice. It wasn't the best chicken pad Thai I'd ever had but still good. Also a good price.
__label__4	"Stopped in for an early breakfast. The service was quick, the coffee was fresh and the place is clean and friendly. I tried something new for me which was the Sweet potato pancakes with blueberries. A unique combo. I ordered a side of sausage (3 links) and coffee. My brother ordered the 2/2/2 combination which included eggs/sausage/blueberry pancakes. 
  The texture of the pancakes was perfect. Everything was good. The total for both was about $21. I would definitely come back for breakfast and even try lunch too."
__label__5	Unbelievable experience.  Fantastic staff, beautiful office and excellent results!  Karee was great.  She met with me and determined what my skin needs, then Ashley went to work.  My skin has made dramatic improvements.  I highly recommend.
__label__4	If you love great local coffee, gluten free donuts, a nice relaxing patio, and wifi... then may I suggest Dawson's Downtown. I know my coffee like I know my jeans, and I can say, this is the best coffee in town! I ordered my usual iced, soy, latte with an extra shot.. perfection! Yet another reason to love Boise.
__label__5	Mark does great work, love to support a local small business. He reshafted my 6 iron after the head had snapped off. He was able to put the proper shaft on and take off my old grip and reuse it. Great work would recommend.
__label__1	Would give 0 stars if I could. There is a sign posted on our building's garage saying they'll tow unauthorized cars. But yet when I actually need them to tow a car they don't have a tow truck capable of working with our parking structure. Why have the signs if you don't have the ability to actually follow through?
__label__5	I can't recommend this place enough! Perfect spot for a great family time. The service and atmosphere was so amazing, food is soooo yummy, honestly couldn't ask for more. Thank you so much for the great dining experience, we will most definitely be back!!!!
__label__5	Not sure why this place only has 2.5 stars but I definitely think the bad reviews are in the past. This place is clean, the servers were very nice/attentive, and the food was yummy!!
__label__3	"Food is good- chicken crispy, Mac and cheese is pretty good, black eye peas were cooked well but too much salt. The worst part about the place are the ignorant young women working there- they are unprofessional, walking around with attitudes on their faces and ear pods in their ears. May go back but not sure I'm in for another wait (took 20+ min- after they had to re- ask me
What I ordered) for people so slow and unorganized."
__label__5	An exemplar of friendly, skillful service with a complex and satisfying menu. We had great menu advice from our server, and the manager made sure we were happy despite a slight delay.
__label__5	"Got some desserts and the olive bread for some holiday meals. Jessie is da wo'man! Olive bread was the hit of the Christmas meal, tasty, salty, rich, mmmm. 

Also had the macarons (the French ones, not the coconut ones), wow! Meyer Lemon tarte, Passyunk Bomb, my personal favorite: Chestnut Dacquoise, Buche de Noel, salted caramel cheesecake. All outstanding!"
__label__3	quait little place with a good jukebox, decent menue, good service and good beers.  I would recomend it to anyone who is near it, but its not somewhere i would go far out of my way to visit.
__label__2	Not happy with this place today, went in for full set of nails and i stated not to long not to short which means in the middle, well my nails look like crap. Then i got my eye brows done and she ripped my skin off and my eyes burn. She said your eyes are sensitive and i always get my eyes done and it never happened. I will not be going back and didnt even offer a refund for my eyes.
__label__5	"Yes vegans, the hype is true!!! This vegan sushi is LEGIT!

40 options with lots of variety! Really cool. Ask for the vegetarian menu and you're all set.

We only had time fit a quick bite but we thoroughly enjoyed our two rolls: veggie woman and veggie Godzilla 

The veggie Godzilla is essentially a tempura fried Avocado roll and is awesome.

Highly recommend this place when you visit Reno"
__label__2	"I thought Aneska (?) did a great job with a brazilian and brown, until I got home and realized my eyebrows are TOTALLY UNEVEN and my face got burnt!!!!!!!!!!!!!

ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

Thats the kind of service I expect at a little crappy asian salon, not a place charging 20 plus just for a brow wax.

Will not be back."
__label__5	The jerk chicken was wonderful! The seasoning was on point! Best I've had in quite a while. I will def be back!
__label__5	My whole family has been going to Tangerine dental since the day it opened.  We have always had a wonderful experience every time we have been there.  From crowns to cleaning we have been well cared for with a tremendous attitude from everyone!  Throughout our years there Wendy has been the one constant. Her sense of humor and genuine concern makes us feel like family.
__label__4	This place is so cheap and tasty, there's really no way to complain. I liked the pork but thought the asada was better! The salsa bar is great too.
__label__1	No distancing, no masks, I walked out when I saw someone pick their nose then pick up a package on the shelf. Sad that some businesses don't care about the health of our community.
__label__5	Hands down best dealership. They were extremely accommodating and easy to deal with. Zack was an awesome sales dealer. He made the process super easy. Would highly recommend him and the entire team at rv one.
__label__4	"My favorite central west end Thai house. Quick hot full of spice & flavor. Reminds me of college neighborhood, maybe it is. Spice it up w the condiments jars yet be careful if the heat. 
Love it as it's an easy walk from my hotel. 
Love the family style staff. You know it's good as I'm eating ton of take home traffic. 
Lots of menu choices try the curry or my favorite Pad Thai chicken.  
Since you are in this neighborhood don't miss the world class Art Gallery in next door Forest Park."
__label__1	"The goal of the partnership with Amazon is to facilitate fast, quick and easy returns. At this location, you have to walk throughout the store lugging your returns. It should be right at the entrance, in and out. 

Not good."
__label__5	Fantastic place to eat the food was very good and service even better. The owner Geno was pleasant and warm. It was my wife's birthday and our server did something special for her and our severs name was Chelsea. She is as crushing it ! Great place for food, service, and overall a great time !
__label__4	"Been here a few times. The service is friendly and informed.

Brunch here had some good options and the food was good, though some of the dishes seemed to be priced high for the quality/quantity of food.

Dishes show glimmers of creativity, though the chef should feel free to take greater risks."
__label__4	The atmosphere just makes you feel at home on top of the great dishes they have. A plus for attentiveness and friendliness. Amazing food. For living in the northeast, it's definitely well worth the drive! I would have given a 5 star rating but it's so hard to find parking. Other than that my lady and I love coming here. Thank you Honey's!!
__label__5	"In Dallas we have a ton of these stores, was surprised to find one and same great service.

Called an order ahead of time, paid for it over the phone and picked it up the next day with no issues at all."
__label__1	Had dinner there tonight with a large party. Worst veal parmigiana I've ever been served. Both my wife's and mine were burned black. The cook has a lot of nerve, just putting sauce on it and sending it out. This place passes itself off as an Italian restaurant, and they can't even make veal parm that is edible. The frozen crap that Stouffer's sells is far better, at least it isn't burned and inedible. Amerigo Vespucci is spinning in his grave that these idiots are ruining his name!
__label__5	"Heather did a great job! I will go back again soon! 
Plus the Groupon and even she is Tier 1 skill, she knows what I want my hair to cut."
__label__5	Fantastic service, our waitress was super nice and we got our food quickly. Very affordable pricing which was even more of a bonus once we tasted the food, which was delicious. They were also flexible with the orders, allowing us to swap meats or ask for extra sauce without any fuss.
__label__1	We had a party of 14 for a friend's birthday. We got here at 3:00. It took until 4:30 to be seated and another hour and a half to get our food. It took speaking with a manager to get our orders correct. The food, when it finally arrived, was delicious and with generous portions. I, however, will not be coming back.
__label__4	"Spicy phô are pretty good, and I had been coming here since I moved to Tucson. I think I had tried a few things here but nothing else was as stand out the spicy phô. It just has much more flavors than any other dishes.

Even the price has been increased from sub $8 to almost $10 over course the years. But when I am in the area during the dinner time. I always stop by get the something (and the owner remember me)  it makes me happy when I took the first sip of the broth...even in the summer!"
__label__5	What a hidden gem!!! I loved this place .. I had the 8oz filet with shrimp which I highly suggest for $2 more it came with 2 sides. I was brought a steak on a hot stone, you pretty much cook the steak yourself to your liking which I loved! We had the calamari with Thai chilli peeper as well..amazing! We also tried the soup trio ..awesome. Such a cool fun experience. The food was amazing! Definitely in my top 10!  Server was great too. I'm going back!
__label__4	"I've been here a few times since I moved to SJ, and I always get a solid meal.  Their mixed drinks are really good (the Malibu something or other is deliciousss). My friends love their beer. 
Iron HIl's Something or other grilled salmon salad is *delicious*, one of my favorite salads around

Iron hill is one of my go to dinner spots"
__label__4	I did a review for Living social already. Desi Vegas was far superior to Mr. John's where I had the worst steak and service I have ever had in my lifetime. Desi Vegas the steak was excellent, cooked exactly as i asked as well as my friend who also was very specific. The fried green tomatoes with the crab meat- the sauce was too heavy and thick- over powered the crabmeat. a holandaise would have been better.The service was excellet and their tiramisu out of this world
__label__5	"This Chic-Fil-A Restaurant is ALWAYS busy! No matter time it is during the day, there are always cars in the drive-thru line. The good news is that they are usually quick about powering through the lines. The staff here is very friendly, efficient, and accommodating. 

Food is always fresh here but I always seem to crave it on Sundays. And as we all know, unfortunately Chic-fil-a is closed on Sundays."
__label__5	They have such a helpful and great staff! I recently bought a harness for my dog and it was too big. They let me return it for the correct size. They always have great treats and fun things to spoil your dog with! It's a must see! Your pets will thank you!
__label__4	Food was good a big thumbs up to the she-crab soup and grouper sandwich. Was not a fan of the baked stuffed flounder it did not have a distinct enough flavor. Service was good and prompt  the only downfall was the weak sangria.
__label__5	I went to Cookie for my first set of lash extensions today and I cannot express how happy I am with the outcome! She took great care of me the entire time and made sure I was comfortable before she got started. Cookie is very sweet (no pun intended) and very professional. Overall, it was a very pleasant experience. I am so happy with the way my eyelashes look and I will definitely be back for a refill! I made a great decision by going to Perfectly Polished Beauty Bar for my very first set of lash extensions. Thank you so much, Cookie!
__label__5	The bagels are excellent. Chewy the way they are supposed to be. Made in NY and baked on site at the Media store. Friendly staff, good prices and they deliver.
__label__1	"First time at this location and probably the last. First, walking in it smelled like spoiled milk. Then, while trying to order my usual, there was literally no soups... None. Then, when our drinks arrive, they were obviously spilled because my hands were extremely sticky for my entire drive home. I haven't even had the food yet, but I'm not looking forward to it...

Go to another restaurant in the area and just avoid this headache."
__label__2	I went with a large group of people. The wait staff kept forgetting about us and didn't refill drinks. It took nearly an hour to get our food. My biscuits with gravy was very dry. Coffee was good, except it never got refilled. Bathrooms were nice, but there was no toilet paper holders, so the roll was just sitting on the floor. Probably wouldn't go back again.
__label__5	This pizza place is very nice and clean.  They do a good job of keeping people safe.  Pizzas were excellent and not greasy.  Fresh toppings and meats.  Well done.
__label__4	"I love the tiki bar tucked away at the back of the restaurant. If you are there on warm day, you might forget you are in Indianapolis.

The cocktails are delicious. I particularly like the dark and stormy. I am not sure what to think of the beer selection. It's been hit or miss, and they don't have many tap lines.

The tacos are decent, and are elevated by the sauces. The mean greenie is my favorite, and they have many to choose from."
__label__1	That place is so disgusting!  Every inch of it is dirty and I won't even get into the nasty things I saw the cooks doing in the back!  And I think there was more food on the floor then on the buffet. I couldn't even eat I was so skeeved out!  Never going there again!
__label__4	"Sunday Brunch...when I think of brunch, I think of an assortment of food and drink.  This brunch is more like a section of one dish and a drink or bottomless mimosas.  I'm must say my dish, sauce biscuit and gravy was delicious And very inexpensive it did not earn the rights of ""brunch.""  The endless mimosas were fabulous @ 18.00.  Service was over the top!"
__label__5	Pet Sitting Service has amazing employees and they treat your pets like there own. I definitely recommend them they are fantastic!
__label__5	I love this place ! The vegetarian menu is amazing ! Finally a place with a great variety of food ! Great customer service as well. I love eating here . I'm a new regular .
__label__5	Saw the smoke coming from their smoker along the side of the road and knew we had to immediately pull over and order! Family run business, mama was outside cooking and we ordered the 3 meat combo platter from inside. Everything was chopped to order and Brandy gave us a sample of the piping hot sausage to try. The platter was around $15 and an extremely generous portion of food. Will return another day!
__label__5	We ordered delivery while on vacation in Redington Shores. We got two calzones and three orders of Stromboli. It was absolutely delicious. The delivery service was quick. The delivery person was very nice. Overall, this was a great experience in every way!!! I recommend Beach Pizza for delivery.
__label__3	Did take out and it was good food, nothing spectacular but it could be better in person.  I would go back again.
__label__3	Just had dinner at this restaurant.  Food was good.  However we were not offered bread with our meal, apparently there were specials on the menu that we were not offered either.  Only found out about them after we had placed our order and the next table were offered them.  We would have liked to order a bottle of wine but were only offered the per glass menu.  On the whole the service was not good.
__label__4	Pretty hip place. Went there after visiting Drexel today, and  was pretty cheap, cool atmosphere, and super fast!(which is all I really care about)... Just remember you're going to a NOODLE house so get something with NOODLES.
__label__5	"The best part of the cruise, is Charles, the historian. We have been on other tours and short cruises/ferry rides, but this was one of the most enjoyable cruises. The food was excellent. The staff and service was excellent. 

I was pleasantly surprised. I had expected to be two mimosas in to ensure the history lesson. Charles crafted his talk in a way that had me totally engaged. He blended facts with stories, and made history come alive. His talk about Hurricane Katrina was both factual and heartbreaking. 

If you are planning a trip to NOLA, but this at the top your list."
__label__5	I love this place. Delicious coffee and sambusas. The people working are friendly and generous.
__label__5	Although there were some problems with our reservation not being found and having to wait on a table, it was well worth it to have Ronald as our waiter. He was such a delight and made the whole night a great experience. Thank you Ronald for being so kind and for having such a beautiful personality. You made this night so much better and your entire ora truly brightens up the room. We will definitely be back, and we will definitely be asking for Ronald. You should too!:)
__label__4	Thin crust pizza. A bit greasy for what we are used to but really delicious and unique toppings. We had The Hammer. Went at 8 on a Thursday night and they were fairly busy. Fun place for drinking but we don't and felt comfortable. There was also a family vibe. Seemed popular with all ages. There was a live jazz and blues band that didn't play for too long which was kind of nice bc it gave us a chance to talk. Nice local place. Will go again.
__label__5	Best museum ever. Perfect for kids of all ages. My 5 year old daughter didn't want to leave. So amazing all the exhibits there. Will blow your mind away. Will definitely come back every time we are in Santa Barbara. Great for kids and adults too!
__label__1	This place is the fucking worst. They gave me the wrong shit then say that's what I ordered. I ordered the number 10. They give me a sausage egg biscuit. Places in the hood are the worst. I hope they close down. Then they always ask off your paying with cash or credit. What difference does it make? What till I get up there and find out.
__label__4	What a fantastic menu!!! There is a great variety of dishes to choose from. It became one of our favorite breakfast places in NOLA. During our stay we had breakfast here three times in a row.  The staff were just fantastic very personable and attenrive. Thank you to all the staff for making our mornings very enjoyable.  We will be back!!!
__label__3	Came here yesterday and the food wasn't the same. I ordered the Pina Loka again and the meat was tough and the peppers and onions weren't cooked enough. I ate a huge chunk of raw onion and the peppers weren't tender. The meal itself wasn't seasoned like before. It was lacking flavor. I'm pretty bummed because I used to love this place. Only good thing I ate yesterday was the tres leches cake.
__label__5	I love this little hole in the wall!  Good breakfast, large portions, delicious! And they have great prices!  Very small so be prepared to wait at certain times but well worth it!  It's not a fancy place, very casual.  Worth a visit or two, or doordash!
__label__4	Super fast, friendly service. Waitress was very attentive. We arrived about 9am on a Sunday, parked for free at the garage next door and were seated immediately. Drinks then food came out fast. French toast was the best I've ever had, hash browns were delicious. Bananas foster waffle was good but nothing special. Huevos rancheros were very good and served beautifully in a skillet. The tiny $5.99 orange juice was definitely overpriced but at least it was good and fresh squeezed.
__label__5	This is a great anytime fitness. I am not a member of this one, but came here when I was on the road. It is bigger than most anytime fitnesses and has everything you need to get the job done. They keep things very clean as well! Recommend.
__label__5	This place is awesome. Always creative flavors that are fantastic. One tip, bring cash because they don't take cards or personal checks. Actually, maybe they would take a check, but who writes checks anymore?
__label__1	"pretty bad uneven haircut.
had to point out to the stylest more than once things were uneven.
had to tell her 4 times that i wanted my bangs above my eyebrows.
i asked her what the terms layered and feathered meant to her and she couldn't explain.
she plain simply didn't know what she was doing.
after a while i called it quits and had to go somewhere else to get it fixed."
__label__4	Wonderful breakfast of huevos rancheros and mesquite pancakes.  Decor is quaint funky southwestern and service very good.
__label__1	this place would not acknowledge specials-that were posted right there in restaurant.  Said due to hurricaine??? sickening price gouging. Spent $100 should have been $20 less. Horrible to do that instead of helping.
__label__1	Our server stated that bottomless mimosas were $3 and when we got the bill it was $20. After discussing this with the manager they essentially called us liars and tried to charge us even more. It's really sad, because I loved the atmosphere and food here, but I will never eat here again after the POOR customer service. I would have never ordered a bottomless mimosa if I knew the actual cost. It wasn't listed on the menu at all.
__label__5	Drunken fish is amazing!! Joey makes our experience great every time we go! Plus the management staff is awesome too. :)
__label__4	"OK, updating my review due to several positive changes. There are some amazing stylists I'm very happy with the outcome of my hair on a regular basis. I have a monthly unlimited membership and am always able to get an appointment as long as I do it a few weeks in advance.  Of course, the weekends are busiest so be sure to make an appointment ahead if you have a special occasion.  

It's fabulous to have a local blow dry bar in town!"
__label__5	"Love the burgers, and they moved 3 weeks ago into a much bigger place still on 4th.  I met the owner, and he was a great guy.  Former Navy man, so deep respect there.

The basket of fries was awesome as well.  You definitely do not leave hungry.  Highly recommended."
__label__4	"Go for lunch (instead of dinner) for more bang for your buck!

Very yummy!  Food comes out as ready, so it's always steamy hot from the kitchen!

Service is not that great.  With a messed up order and poor attitude, the waitress didn't get a huge tip.

Tom Yum soup is great!

They are open to customizing your order, but do not warn you of additional charges!  I got charged $2 for a tiny amount of addt'l peanuts!  They must be nuts!"
__label__5	I love Bread Top House.  They have, by FAR, the best bubble tea in Philadelphia.  While all those other places use powder to make their tea, BTH uses real fruit, which makes the drinks SUPER YUMMY!!!  There is no comparison.  The honeydew tea is my favorite.  Their tapiocas are perfect - small-ish sweet and medium consistency.  The packaging is so cute too.  You totally owe it to yourself to have some and for $3 the price is great.  I've never tried any of their food though, so I can't comment on that.
__label__5	The 3-in-1 cemetery tour was AMAZING! And it was all thanks to our tour guide, Rose. She's so funny and knowledgeable and really made the experience magical. Seriously, if you're flexible with when you can take your tour, I would recommend calling and asking when you could join a Rose tour. I can't praise her enough!
__label__4	Took my boyfriend here for his 25th birthday. We had the Porterhouse to share and it was delicious! The food was fantastic, but the atmosphere was slightly snooty and we felt slightly uncomfortable at times. We had the Steak Tartare to start, and asparagus and stuffed hashbrowns as sides. The stuffed hashbrowns were AMAZING!
__label__3	Amazing pizza, not the best service,  Ordering can be confusing if you just want a slice of a particular pizza, because they won't sell you just a slice.
__label__5	By far the best around!  Quality ingredients along with good service.  Highly recommend you give them a try.
__label__3	Good Bar food as always. Menu has expanded since I started coming here years ago when kids were small. Great family and group gathering place
__label__5	Authentic, huge portions, extensive menu and delicious! Ordered twice already; Enchiladas Verdes, Nachos Mixto, and the Torta are fantastic! Must give this place a try, they are on DoorDash during this Covid 19 times.
__label__5	YES!!! If you're into your coffee you'll like this place. Go in and order a cortado and the barista doesn't look at you like you're talking a foreign language. Great place with great coffee!!
__label__1	Wonderful food and service. Pregnant and in the rain. For no reason.  But totally ridiculously asked to go out the back door despite the pouring rain when we left - on a random Wednesday night when it was NOT busy. We ran into zero people and were about 10ft from the door and asked to turn around and walk all the way back and around the building. Pregnant and in the rain. For no reason.
__label__3	"Pros:

Good Burger
Good Fries

Cons:

Communal Seating
Uncomfortable Seats
Filthy Restroom(s)

Ordering at a counter, then having someone deliver the burger is strange and nonsense."
__label__5	The food was perfectly spiced and I loved that they have vegetarian greens! We will return for sure!
__label__5	"Love this place, Patrick Feury never dissapoints. And yes, it's in the suburbs! The food is delicious and beautiful, the staff is impeccable and attentive. Best appetizer: steamed pork buns with hoisin sauce & edamame dumplings. Sushi & sashimi delicious, ""yellowtail two ways"" - mhhhhh! The place itself is stunning, not getting tired of it no matter how often we come back."
__label__5	"Really happy this place opened in Newtown. Been there several times and already have a favorite server... Kate! We are always a bit of a roudy table, and Kate is awesome! She handles our annoying group well - ""what I want isn't on the menu"", ""I need a separate check"" 

She's quick and she's smart and she always adds to our evening there.

Yes, the Figgy Piggy is great, but get it from Kate!"
__label__5	Was craving pho and this place met my needs! So flavorful and delicious, ingredients were FRESH. Had the shrimp dumplings as well which also exceeded expectations. Will definitely be back.
__label__3	"I like the pizza. It's a typical super greasy mom and pop shop pizza with loads of cheese on it. If you like a grease dripping slice like I do, this place is for you.

Do not trust their web site! All the images are stock photos and the prices are incorrect. Their pizzas look nothing like the photos."
__label__5	Amazing Food - really Fantastic food!!! Great ambiance, great music and drinks.  Hands down NOLA spot!!!
__label__5	Cafe and froyo! And both done very well! Great place to hangout an study. The staff is amazing also.
__label__3	I only really like this place because of the crab fries. They are one of my favorite things to eat. ever. Everything else could use improvement. From the food to the service to the prices it's all kinda meh. BUT THEM CRAB FRIES ARE A LITTLE GIFT FROM THE CRUSTACEAN GODS.
__label__3	Food was so so, but not bad. Walk from hotel, 5min, had breakfast, omelet was broken up means too much inside. If you're looking for quick service, good priced, not bad in a pinch food I'd come here.
__label__5	This is probably one of my favorite breakfast places in Brandon. I bring all of my friends and family here - needless to say I come here often. My favorite meal is any of the seasonal hashes! Today we came in and the coffee was ~different. Super bitter and strong, but we asked about it and learned that they changed roasts and have a lovely conversation with the manager about the change of their products. Lovely man, love this restaurant!
__label__5	Wow this hotel is what's a great adjective? The lobby and the Carousel lounge are full of people. I am writing this before noonish. Here's an adjective exciting, or bustling. The grandfather clock in the lobby is ringing.   The staff is very helpful. The heated pool upstairs on the rooftop is delightful. We have stayed here many times and when we checked in received an upgrade. Very nice room. Until the next trip to Crescent City.
__label__1	COMPLETE GARBAGE!!! Don't waste your money!  My Tesla Model S clean up EASILY in auto washes back home but this $15 wash was the worse money I've ever spent on a wash!! Left dirt ALL over the back end..... Simply HORRIBLE!
__label__5	I've had nothing but good experiences here! I like the lay out of this Meijer & the staff is always friendly and helpful when I need it. I also really enjoy the pharmacy at this location!
__label__1	1 word: Yuck!  Stopped by to grab a bite to eat while on my way to my Sissies. The smell of the Lo-Mein was so bad, so repulsive, so disgusting that we had to throw it away. Never again.
__label__5	Good, solid Chinese food.  Convenient pick up window for Togo orders made fast and accurate.  A staple restaurant at my house.
__label__5	Good food and good service! Coming hungry I ordered a bunch of appetizers (miso ramen, alaskan sushi roll, and okonomiyaki) and I was full! The waiter is a really cool guy and brings out the food quickly!
__label__2	Stopped here on Easter Sunday while on vacation.  Wish I had read the reviews ahead of time, but we were hungry and our choices in the area were limited.  The food is just barely average.  We ordered fried green tomatoes that were ok.  My husband enjoyed his Cuban sandwich, but my salad was grossly over dressed and my angel pasta was overcooked, as were the shrimp.  Worst meal of our vacation in Tampa so far.
__label__2	"Service was great, but the food really isn't. McDonalds sized burger for Bobby's Burger Palace prices, pricey soda stands about 4"" tall with majority being ice. With so many food trucks and stuff around it's a total waste."
__label__5	"This spot has it all. It has pretty good crawfish when its in season, good poboys, etc. It is also one of the most acclaimed spots for turkey necks, if that's your jam. But this review isn't about those things. This review is about the FRIED RICE. North Broad Seafood has the best fried rice in the city. My boyfriend and I frequently go out of our way for this fried rice. 
Do yourself a favor and try it out for yourself."
__label__4	"Went in Thur 29th 1130 not crowded but not as many samples as years past . Also the 7$ off  half home minimum size seems to has gone up to 8lbs or more? 

Go to spot for holiday half bone in ham. $$ but consistently good. Other sides , rolls & deserts. I find 7$ off coupon in paper or onlinpays tax? ) and order ahead & pickup 3 days before holiday otherwise slammed."
__label__5	"Most under-rated pizza place in all of south philly!

SIMPLY OUTSTANDING!!!!!!!!!!

I will say, though, that walking in and buying slices to go is way better than buying a whole pizza.  The slices come out crisp and sooooo unbelievably delicious."
__label__4	"1) This restaurant is dark.  As in... barely a light on in the place.  It was 5pm.  Mood lighting to the extreme.
2) The front door greeter lady was not too friendly.  Our waitress was very nice.
3) The food was legit.  I got the duck Cuban and it was delish.
4) If you're a bit of a prude, steer clear -- the walls are adorned with some rather...interesting art.

All in all -- Yummmm!"
__label__1	I wish we could have given a better review, but they totally lost our order, didn't tell us and then by the time we had figured out what the heck was going on we had an appointment we needed to get to.
__label__5	Have visited a couple times, they have a large selection and a nice walk in humidor. Very helpful staff, willing to answer any questions you may have or make recommendations. Nice selection of higher end cigars too.
__label__3	The cheesesteaks here aren't bad but I'd rather go down the street to Pats. I felt like the steak here is a little too salty and also the political signs are kinda uncomfortable to look at. The signs are a little obnoxious. Its a good place to try but not somewhere I would eat at regularly.
__label__1	Make us wait in cold to get food.   Don't have the decency to tell us how long to wait.  Ordered online said 30 min.   Been standing in cold rain 1 hr.  Won't text us when ready so can sit in car.   Had a few issues with service before but this is it.   Done.
__label__2	Margaritas r huge and a good value. There was no wait and was able to get right in. I came in at lunch time on a Saturday and was told that I couldn't order from the lunch menu because it was the weekend. Like there isn't a lunch on the weekend. Also I have never been to a Mexican restaurant where when I asked for chips and salsa they told me it was a charge and sold as an appetizer now. Seems a little off to me. Won't be back.
__label__4	I stopped in here for lunch last week and what a nice surprise!  The staff was very friendly, the atmosphere was relaxing, and the food delish!  I love thin crust pizza, and this pizza was special.  Coal fired, great sauce, a nice blend of quality cheeses... perfecto!  I'll admit, I went back 3 days later so the hubs could experience this.  They have craft beers, too, but I wasn't a fan of the oatmeal porter I had- maybe it was just too early in the day.  I would highly recommend this place!
__label__5	This is the only Emeril restaurant I've been to and I love it! This is a casual place but still great for a date night! My date had the duck confit and I had the salmon. The flavor matching was perfect for both dishes. We both enjoyed it and was the perfect meal right before a night of drinking. The portions are on the small side relative to the oversized portions that most American restaurants provide but I think it's a great size. Trust me you won't be leaving with regret!
__label__1	Not great food at all.  Menu is extremely big..and why i don't know.  Keep it simple! When food arrived it was dry & bland.  Maybe they should change to just a beer & appetizer only.  Too LOUD! DOES a place really need to be that big....If u don't want to talk to the person your with....GO THERE...HA, HA
__label__1	Very disappointed. Ordered 4 rolls within 5 minutes of sitting down. Ended up leaving an hour later with no food. It was 5pm on a Saturday night & there was one other couple in the restaurant but they had only 1 roll ready after an hour. Extremely sad to have to write this place off as I used to really like the food.
__label__3	Pretty good place. Not five stars by any means, but consistently three stars. On my most recent visit I had a BLT. Nice amount of bacon on it. A tad salty. Got their homemade potato chips on the side ($1.00 extra charge). Wish the sandwich included a side. Surprisingly, they do a really good job at desserts! I've had their bacon pralines, Elvis king cake, and a peanut butter and jelly cookie - all were outstanding! I think I like their desserts better than their sandwiches.
__label__3	Good location and gorgeous view.  Service was okay.  Patio was dirty.  Cobb webs and dirt on the patio furniture.  The food was okay.  The waiter was excellent.
__label__5	"Great spot to relax or grab a bite from our favorite local foodie spots. Lots of sun and shade options. Property has lots of trees and two gazebos. Regular festivals are a great time to get to know the locals and meet furry friends (pet friendly spot). Love coming here on the weekends to unwind. 

Park next to the park or in the parking garage down the block. Very walkable. Local spot away from the very touristy areas on the coast. We love it here!"
__label__5	Convenient.  Great classes, including Barre, Yoga, Spinning and a variety of others.  Clean equipment.  Friendly staff.
__label__5	I had the Zenburger and truffle fries. It was amazing. Service was really good too.
__label__2	$11.00 for a flavorless lentil soup and a hot chocolate only someone without tastebuds could enjoy.  I've been to many LPQs and have had tasty meals, but I shall never return to this one.
__label__5	Dr Peshek is great. He really cares. The office staff is amazing. I have been going to Dr Peshek since 2010 and never once have I ever had a bad experience. Great place.
__label__5	Beautiful views. Had the She-crab soup and it was yummy!!! Sunset views, happy waitresses, happy patrons!
__label__4	Was taking a stroll of south st and wanted a quick bite to eat. Noticed the line wasn't too bad and decided to get one of the giant slices of pizza. Pizza is kept nice and simple aside from being a massive slice. Pizza slices can come on a few plates or a box. I would opt paying for a box as the pizza is otherwise a 2 hand affair.
__label__4	This is probable the nicest Japanese restaurant I've been to in Tampa.  Service was EXCELLENT.  Our waitress was very attentive and nice.  The food, however, was just average.  It's great compared to some other restaurants in Tampa, but not compared to other restaurants I've tried elsewhere.  I gave them 4 stars though because it's rare nowadays to find such exceptional service.
__label__5	CPR did an outstanding job replacing the digitizer on my iPad mini. The tech who worked on my mini came out and gave me some suggestions about a better case to prevent the reoccurrence. Dean in customer service was well informed, courteous and very helpful in suggesting the tempered glass for better pertection. The repair was completed the same day. The cost of the repair was reasonable. I would highly recommend CPR to my friends and family.
__label__1	The Denver omelet was something that I didn't think any self respecting restaurant could mess up. Well this was a unfortunate disappointment that does truly degrade the rating for this establishment. Claimed to have ham, really, I should have noticed any sort of meat. It's very easy to mix bell peppers and onions with eggs and spill the concoction onto a grill. This is not an omelet, it is eggs with bell pepper and onion. I won't be having breakfast omelets here again, truly disappointed for claiming to have the best breakfast in Tucson.
__label__3	I guess my expectations  were high reading all the reviews. I loved the ambiance of the place but that's about it. The menu is limited. We ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, Rigatoni alla vodka and Sundays gravy. It was nothing exceptional. I personally did not care for the meat at all.  Everything tasted charred. This was not authentic Italian as some reviews stated. Service was ok, again nothing exceptional. I dont think I'd recommend.
__label__5	Great fresh gyro, kebabs, and salads. Great for the family with lots of options. They also do catering and carry out for family dinners, perfect alternative to the usual fast food food fare. Super friendly service and other fun options, hard to not find something good here.
__label__5	My husband and I were lucky enough to work with Lucia for our engagement shoot and for our wedding day! Right off the bat Lucia and I realized we had very similar tastes in style and aesthetics, which made me feel at ease knowing that I would love the photos. Lucia went above and beyond to make sure we got the shots that we wanted and that we looked our best. Lucia's laid-back but also helpful approach really worked for us, and we absolutely love all the photos! If you're looking for a wedding photographer, do not hesitate to book Lucia!
__label__5	Fixed my Omnichord quickly, solidly, and at a reasonable rate. Good service and communication. Has helped me out a couple times having things I've needed - mic cables, drumsticks, etc. Great place to have in the neighborhood.
__label__5	So much fun!!! Donald, the owner, is very responsive  and made planning our ride very easy. My party had so much fun riding through the Quarter dancing and throwing our beads out to the crowds on the street. We had such a great time! I highly recommend!!
__label__3	This is a nice place-and the food, while nothing extraordinary, is decent and portions good. The service is super fast...menu a bit too large and confusing, but certainly all the classic trad Mexican dishes are there. I will not return.
__label__5	I had to get my windshield replaced and they were able to get me an appointment that day and it was very quick! Looks good!
__label__5	Grabbed late night take out after work- beef chow fun and scallion pancake. The pancakes were the best I've had in Chinatown. The beef chow fun was tasty and beef had great texture.
__label__5	i've owned a few bikes over the years but would not consider myself a motortcycle dude. nevertheless i immediately loved see sees. first off, really nice employees.no cold, sterile hipster attitude from the baristas. stumptown coffee, portlands best, is sold here and so far they have been very cool about refills.  southern facing outdoor seating means lots of sun. they have a small assortment of food and some cool clothing and more. i will be back. its nice to deal with employees who are ok with their job. good work!!
__label__4	"Travelling through area when we got a huge chip on our motorhome windshield. Worried it would spread then crack, we searched online and chose Dwight's. 

The receptionist said a tech would come to us within an hour and Francisco showed up in less than that. 

Professional and polite, we chatted with him about travels and places to see. 

He quickly fixed the chip, wrote up the invoice with the  quoted price, called the office with credit card info and we were quickly on our way. 

Chip is well sealed -- no issues at all!"
__label__2	"Do not waste your time or money.  Mediocre at best. Place feels cheap and steaks were tasteless and pure gristle. I'm not usually one to complain, but I told my wife I would feel better if I had gone to smoothie king and got the gladiator and tipped them $100. :)
Will not go back."
__label__2	Good coffee and the food is food, nothing very special / delicious - your average coffee shop. The baristas can use some more training, especially in being friendly and welcoming to customers.
__label__5	"Great Dinner, Great Chocolate, and what a nice person is the lady who own this little place in the middle of somewhere in Philadelphia..

Next time I am in town I will go back for sure!"
__label__5	Delicious! We got the Gyros pizza. Would definitely do it again. We're from out of town, so we dined in. Most business is take out or delivery- only 3 tables for eating in.
__label__3	This is a great spot for a drink and people watching. The view is fantastic! I would stick with the bar food and don't order anything too fancy. The cocktails are pretty good too.
__label__1	I was not all that impressed with the quality and quantity of Garcia's food for the price.  Now that I know they have a practice of actually stealing the tips of their employees, who they pay less than minimum wage, I am seriously disagusted by their criminal behavior, immoral lack of humanity, and ethics.
__label__4	I have been wanting to visit this place because I have heard lots of positive feedback. The ice is soft & delicious! There are so many creative & delicious flavors to try. I will be returning soon to try other flavors, but I am happy that they have a location near me.  Service was very good. My daughter got a strawberry Sno-Ball stuffed with ice cream in the middle. She loved it!
__label__5	A beautiful Israeli dining experience. The playlist is on point. The waiters are caring and thoughtful; they truly make you feel like the most important table in the place. Everything I tried was delicious! It's worth going with a couple people to share and try as much as possible. Nothing will disappoint. The portions are small so don't be shy ordering more as you go.
__label__5	Best bagels around!! I go in everyday for garlic bagels. The bagels are always fresh and delicious. The new owner and his staff couldn't be nicer or more accommodating. After finding bagel cafe I won't go anywhere else.
__label__1	Do not park your semi here for more than a day, got back and my truck had been towed, no signs stating that. $880 to get it out and had to drive 30 miles to pick it up!!
__label__5	Flavorful food. Excellent service. This was our third or fourth visit. Great British Pub atmosphere.
__label__5	Just had a fabulous dinner here. Great decor and scenery. Quality and sharp staff. Totally recommend ! I had the lamb and banana special dessert !
__label__1	Disagree with they guy that said welcoming for first timers. Tried to get my first tattoo here a few years ago. Basically laughed at me, turned me away and genuinely told me I had a big ego for wanting an arm (not even forearm) tattoo. Got it somewhere else and am still in love! The people down at Los Vegas tattoos have given me my first second and third and couldn't be more welcoming, I'd recommend them for anyone who isn't a male with two full sleeves already.
__label__5	Every time I'm here my piercer is super friendly and down to earth.  I've never had a bad experience here!
__label__5	This is a must have on any breakfast occasion! I've only had below excellent service once - due to a huge party (probably celebrating a birthday or something). Other than that, I really enjoy all of the specials that seem to get better each and every day. This is a must eat for us Tucsonans and all who like an outstanding meal!
__label__4	"Ended up in Tucson on Christmas (which I don't observe) and Seoul Kitchen was one of the few places open.  Turned out to be great.  

We ordered the shrimp shumai, BBQ Pork/Beef combo, and Jap Chae. Served with various banchan.

Tasty, spicy (though I wouldn't have minded a little more heat), and plentiful."
__label__2	The food was okay but the service sucks. It took them 15 to 20 minutes to get our food and there was only 1 other customer in the restaurant. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.
__label__4	They probably have the best papas downtown. Have always had friendly service here, and the margarita I tried was on point. The cauliflower tacos are a must try, although I was sad to hear that they got rid of their breakfast menu.
__label__1	Horrible and slow service. Order was incorrect. Food turned out ok, but had to wait forever to get it.
__label__5	Found a rare BMW 545i manual from this place. These guys were real accommodating with me flying into Reno. The car was actually cleaner than it was in the pictures. Made some good friends with the staff and look forward to reaching out when the time comes again for another purchase.
__label__3	This is the case of where the hype outweighs the product. Ordered a double pep and double cheese, and not even close to being right. Needed to be cooked longer the dough had little flavor. Just seems like it should be alot better than what it is.. at a loss for words but think they need to rework dough recipe and having few toppings even though I ordered double worries of how many toppings there would be if single toppings?? Service was good and fast
__label__1	As a former New Yorker, I was happy to see the Shake Shack make its way to Philly. Of course, I have since quit meat and thought, I'll go get a shake and one of the shroom burgers.  One bite and I had to  toss it. Super deep fried & greasy, and when I bit Into it this hot as hell cheese liquid went all over. It really was unpleasant. Next time, I'll go over to Franklin Square Park (awesome veggie burger at the Starr stand).
__label__5	Detiene la Caida de Cabello, Shampoo Natural de Hierbas a Base de Romero. Elimina la Caspa y Nace Nuevo Cabello  - Hierbitas Hair Care
__label__5	Kabuki has excellent sushi and service is always quick and friendly.  Have been coming for years and I never grow tired of the food!! A+
__label__5	Love, love, LOVE the Hidden Grill. We order food from here at least a couple times a week. This spot is a local neighborhood gem and we've never been dissatisfied or disappointed. The portions are generous, the menu imaginative, and on top of it all the food is healthy and delicious. I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone!
__label__2	The food is okay here, but the preparation takes forever. They have about 3 people working in the kitchen and they don't have any customers dining in but they still manage to take their good old time and take forever. The food is also highly overpriced and it was not amazing and on top of that extremely  slow service. Other than that their food was okay and the workers were nice.
__label__5	Highly recommend Gene! He washed 25 of our windows, inside and outside, including screens over 3 floors. Excellent quality, totally reasonable price, and kind and professional.
__label__5	This is possibly the most favorite Mexican restaurant in town the staff is friendly and courteous. And they always know what I want to drink because they are familiar with us already.   we come here quite frequently with friends. We love to come here when we're celebrating or just on Friday night after work especially sitting at the bar.bar staff is always friendly service is prompt and the food is delicious I highly recommend Barbacoa tacos
__label__2	Its 430 in the afternoon, and we have been here almost and hour, and we haven't gotton food yet. Our server in super sweet, but we are the only table here, and being a person from the service industry, I feel like we should have been feed by now. I love this place, but this is dissapointing.
__label__5	I've been here numerous times and tried a different dish each time. TAP never fails. You can't go wrong with anything you choose. Don't leave without the coconut ice cream and sticky rice dessert!
__label__4	Good, solid burgers at a fair price. Nicely done shoestring fries alongside, capped with a nice variety of shakes. And the dipping sauces? Fuggedaboutit! Whoever thought of all those combinations are brilliant (including roasted marshmallow, which was actually quite interesting). All in all a nice time, and given the chance I'll gladly go back.
__label__4	I am a big fan of Chinese food.  I like buffets a lot, and I eat at this place weekly--mostly out of convenience.  It is a very average place and the food is what you'd expect.  This is certainly not on the scale of WTT Buffet.  The food is of average quality, but is prepared very well.  The staff is absolutely great!  All of them work really hard.  The place is also very clean.  Not a bad place for a quick meal.
__label__5	This place is amazing.  50 foot bar.  24 craft beers. Music every weekend.  Food I'd  awesome.  They have some things on the menu you couldn't find at other places.  Pot stickers,  homemade dressings,  delicious potato skins,  amazing French dip. The staff is amazingly friendly.
__label__5	The best place to get ur hair did in NOLA! John's the best and his team is great.
__label__5	"This place was absolutely amazing. The food was so delicious I would go back in heartbeat. 

We ordered the roast duck - cooked perfectly, and veal topped w lobster! Large plates that are very tasty. Could not put my fork down. 

Wait staff was so kind and helpful in choosing with us what to pick. We got to dine outside which was what we preferred however it did seem a little bit too loud inside when we peaked in so just be ware.. otherwise would absolutely recommend and go again myself."
__label__5	Amazing!! Nick cleaned my boots and they are like brand new!! Great place!!!
__label__1	Very rude manager and terrible service.. food was average and not worth coming again for it.. worst experience for me in Tampa! They did huge mistake in my order and when I found out about it the lady refused to apologize and she said the Chef sometimes got confused!! And she refused to waive the fee or apologize!! I don't recommend this place at all!
__label__1	"A cheap admission price is worthless when the movie is poorly projected with a battered print, not properly focused, and with a dim projector bulb -- which was the case here (despite its being a comfortable theater). Didn't help that the manager said, ""That's the way the director shot it."" No, it wasn't the way the director shot it. It was the way you exhibited it: poorly."
__label__1	Worst customer service ever.  Peter was very inconsiderate and offensive. We rented a car that was reserved. Took 30 minutes to find the reservation, after that the person who did the contract quick circled on the contract where to sign after my spouse told them that we have our own insurance and didn't need there's. Watch yourself you'll get charged for nothing as we found out when returning the car. My phone says scam likely. And you cannot quick circle a contract that voids the contract.
__label__5	This is a must every time I come to the city. Great pizza, ever, and cocktails. The staff is very friendly and genuine. We always enjoy a stop here. They don't disappoint.
__label__5	"We have used The Carpet Tender for several years.   Great employees, excellent results.  We also have them clean area rugs.  Outstanding results..
Even more impressive, our 6 month puppy tried to unravel our carpet.  The Carpet Tenders did an amazing repair job.. you would never know it was damaged.  

We appreciate no up selling when they do the job.   One fair price and always an outstanding job.."
__label__4	LOve it! The owner is super awesome and funny! Chalk board walls are fun too!
__label__5	Absolutely beautiful gallery and real score for downtown Tucson.
__label__1	I boarded my cat here, who never had fleas I picked him up and he had fleas very badly. When I called they didn't take any ownership and they said they would call me back, which they never did. I would never recommend boarding your pet here. I have spent a small fortune fighting fleas and my cat is injured from scratching so much
__label__1	Horrible place. Small portion. No flavor. Not a true Vietnamese food . Don't go there
__label__5	Always love McKay's! My kids and I visit at least 2 or 3 times a month! Always find what we're looking for!
__label__4	This place was very crowded although it was on a Friday summer dinner hour.  I saw people of all ages come and go.  The decor was brought and colorful.  I put in an order with Juliet. Miss. Juliet was very helpful and made sure to get my to-go order right.  The Chicken Flautas was large and full of meat, the Mole sauce was a little too sweet but the enchiladas were very good as was the spicy taco sauce. I hope to go back and have a sit down dinner soon.
__label__3	"Like Toby Keith, it's not as good as it once was.

Carne Asada burrito is my goto here. The veggie blend is nice with cilantro and cabbage for a nice crunch. The hot sauce is among my favorite. But as goes most restaurants it goes mainstream and can't maintain what was so great for so many reasons from flavor to the feel to price."
__label__5	Amazing place!! Clean, super relaxing and aesthetically pleasing. I've been going for years now and they've always been great! Ann is amazing and always makes sure that you have a good experience, along with the rest of the staff. They also have a student discount on Tues and Wed which is great as it is super close to Villanova and nearby colleges. Love them, don't know what I'd do without them!!
__label__3	Went the very first opening night so there were some expected issues. We sat at the bar and ordered ordered the chicken. After an hour and a half without chicken, we asked for the check. We suspect that it was delivered to the wrong people because we saw people around us seated after us eat chicken. Overall the service was slow but they were packed. They have a pretty good mark up and should be turning a nice profit. But it is a great selection. We were served the fries which were truly amazing. I will return for the fries and to hopefully try the chicken.
__label__5	"Avacodo toast for $15?  That's what I was thinking until I blacked out and woke up on the other side of a clean plate thinking ""I want to meet the person that made this dish and make out with them.""   Yeah it's like that."
__label__5	This place doesn't have just amazing crêpes it also has very good coffee. A great place to go for brunch.
__label__5	Such a great experience here! Visiting from out of town and needed a last minute mani/pedi. These people are wonderful! I will come back if I'm ever in town again.
__label__1	I brought my grandmother's antique ring here to be sized and I did not have it on for 30 minutes when it broke.  When I brought it back to have them fix the weld, they cut the entire bottom half of the setting off and welded a hideous hoop earring to it.  It ruined a beautiful ring.  When I went to pick it up and told them that it was not at all what I wanted, they were extremely rude.  Then they charged me $100 to get my ring back!  BEWARE!!!  DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THESE PEOPLE!
__label__4	This place is a fairy tale come to life. It's gorgeous and delightful and wonderful. Service has gotten better, but sometimes is very slow. Desserts and coffees are totally delicious. Prices are a little steep, but you're also kinda paying for the atmosphere.
__label__5	The food here is amazingly delicious and takes me right  back to South East Asia! We ordered the Bak Kut Teh, Kangkung Belacan, Seafood Belacan, and the Roast Duck! Service was quick and efficient. You could shop next door for your Asian Groceries while waiting for your food!
__label__3	The food was excellent. I had the beet salad and drum fish ceviche. The restaurant is very noisy and the seating is not terribly comfortable though. The waiter was very nice and attentive.
__label__4	"As a regular visitor to the city since my dad is from Nashville I like coming here as a local rather than a tourist. Gets some tourists but luckily not many. Of course the pub and food aren't going to be exactly like going to England. But having been across the pond I'll say the food is comparable to any pub you may go to while in the UK.
Service is really good. Fast and friendly. Great place to chill and get away from the insanity of Music Row."
__label__5	I love the food and the service. Everything in here is delicious. And the beer was amazing.
__label__4	So tasty ate every bite! Had the curry beef and jerk chicken, both very delicious. The jerk had a nice spice, not too much or too little. Lots of small bones so be careful. The plantains were amazing! A lot like sweet potato. Wish there had been a bit more. Next time will order these as an app! Paid just a little too much though. Will go back during the lunch special.
__label__4	The chicken burrito here is fantastic. Expect a wait, because they grill a whole chicken breast to order for this bad boy. Served on a whole wheat wrap - it's the size of a small child. Fresh rice, balck beans, pico, fresh slices of jalapeno, sour cream, and guacamole. Mmmm, mmm good! Two of us split it for about $7 - honestly it's so good I don't pay attention to the price anymore. Do yourself a favor and get one!
__label__5	"Stopped in for a dinner on a Sunday night in January. Had the surf&turf skewers as an appetizer. Two scallops, two large shrimp and two chunky pieces of Filet for 15 bucks. Can't beat it. Followed that with grilled grouper with two different veggies. Memorable flavor. Excellent fish.

Pleasantly surprised by attentive server who made an out-of-towner feel at home. Kept drink full and stopped by frequently with a genuine smile to make sure that all was well. Ask for ""Alley"" if you go."
__label__5	A Tucson classic. This place is a beautiful trip to a time past. The prime rib is made in the classic way. So delicious.
__label__4	"Whenever I plan on breaking my diet, I go here. Specifically. For the Cuban. With fries. And beer.

Make that 2 beers.

Totally worth it. 



Ok, maybe 3 beers."
__label__1	It's a horrible restaurant. I don't have enough time to write all the things that were wrong with it
__label__5	I love the breakfast buffet on weekdays. Its great on weekends also but it cost $2.00 more. I go particularly for the blueberry pancakes. Their bacon is delicious with them. For protein I have scrambled eggs with mushrooms and cheese sauce. I certainly splurge when I go there and eat too much, because it is so good. Fresh fruit and lots of other items are available, but Blueberry pancakes can't be beat. If the food available isn't warm enough or it looks old, just mention it and the staff jumps on it right away.
__label__4	This is one of our 'go-to' spots. We haven't been disappointed with a single dish. Be warned, this is a family restaurant so speed is not their thing, be prepared to wait and enjoy a slower paced meal. If you are patient you will be rewarded with a fantastic meal!
__label__5	Great happy hour place!! Especially in the summer, when you can sit outside. Food was amazing! Some vegan options available. Definitely try the edamame dumplings!! It was my friend's birthday and they brought out mini ice cream cones - so sweet!
__label__5	Gus is back today from taking a few weeks off.  He got all new equipment and a fryer for his cart and he now has an assistant to help him out.  I got there at 11:35 today with one person in front of me and had my food within a couple of minutes.  Its definitely a lot faster now with the assistant.
__label__1	We wanted to like this place but food mediocre at best. Never had a chewy chili relent--quite disgusting. Flautas over cooked and not tasty. Carnitas has odd flavor. Service,however, was excellent.
__label__4	Caprice salad was average. Pretty small but good. Salmon was very good. Service was good and quick.
__label__1	"I will never bring my car back to this dealership for service.  Multiple trips for the same problem and it is still unresolved. No one follows up.  Notes weren't entered into the computer, so once again I waste another Saturday morning here. They honesty seem incompetent. The service manager was rude and seemed to give me the ""you're a female and you don't know what you are talking about"" thing. A total waste of my time.  Taking my car elsewhere. Worst experience I have ever had trying to get my car serviced."
__label__2	It seems to be a popular one but it was just okay nothing to write home about and I definitely wouldn't go again. ‍
__label__4	Very helpful and attentive staff.  The location is small compared to big-box corporate hardware stores that have taken over America but this place probably has exactly what you need with minimal time/fuss (plus possibly a bag of popcorn).
__label__5	I have been there a few times and have never met a more earnest restauranteur.  The place is adorable, and cozy. The food is all fresh, tasty and cooked to order. Last night they ran out of falafel (they were soooo busy) and it was fun to watch him mix up a fresh batch from scratch.  Simple, delicious, inexpensive food.  So happy to have a kosher, vegetarian nearby place to go.
__label__1	I ordered a washer dryer and refrigerator.  I was told it would be delivered on a Thursday, never showed up.  Rescheduled for Sunday 12:30 -4:30, was told would be there 12:30-12:40.  At 5:30 I called and they said they were there but no one was home.  I waited all day for two days with no one to show up.  The manager Zach and delivery people are obviously liars and not to be trusted.  All I wanted was my appliances.  Will never do business with them again.  Beware.
__label__1	Told me he was going to charge me for mud on my shoes to clean it up then snatched the money from my hand when paying
__label__5	"This review is for the restaurant in the loop.  GREAT food! Best taste I've ever had. I ordered the spicy pork tacos... but I had to have more... so I got a gogi bowl. I was stuffed. Left overs. I got a bumper sticker so I could rep Seoul Taco in another state!  I miss that awesome flavor. Would love to just.. jet out and grab some great food!

Thanks for a great experience.

The service was really nice too. Smiling faces all around."
__label__1	Not good. Went here for dinner and chicken on nachos was cold. Like freezing cold. Asked the server to send them back. She brought out a small bowl of microwaved chicken. Not what I expected.  Other food wasn't bad. I know working with food if you don't cook the food to the right temperature I could get sick. Didn't seem like they cared too much.
__label__4	Pretty good, professional, fast. And you get a free Carwash ( not sure if it was because I got their most expensive oil change or if it's always included) I was pretty happy with the service.
__label__1	Food is always burnt, drink was watery, servers were rude and the wait time is ridiculous.
__label__5	Alonzo was our  server and he was fantastic he knew everything he was doing he was exceptionally courteous to all of us he was very experienced and what he was doing his knowledge of the menu was absolutely great he has an awesome personality with us. People like him is why we come here
__label__4	We came here for breakfast, lunch and dinner and each meal was authentic and delicious. My husband tried the paella it was bursting with flavor, although he wasn't a fan that they served it with octopus. The owner and staff said they can make anything on the menu gluten free (burrito bowl instead of flour tortilla). We definitely recommend Jalapenos 2 if your in the area. Lastly their music selection is an added bonus.
__label__5	My first visit was great!  I was very nervous but Ashley N. explained in detail the procedure and what to expect before, during and after.  Erasable Inc. has very professional staff and a relaxing atmosphere.  Both Ashley N. & Loretta are the best! Erasable Inc. is the place to go!
__label__4	I like this place, I enjoy the food every time I go. Their cheesecake is the best, there's no other place whose cheesecake compares to Copeland's.
__label__4	They are reasonable, they credit you for issues that are their fault. Sometimes local cabs are better, if more expensive and cash-oriented, but Uber really tries and cares about your experience.
__label__5	Fantastic little spot. Love all their specialty drinks and how effort the baristas put into them. They have free WiFi and plenty of places to sit and get some work done. Place fills quickly on the weekends. Would definitely make this my regular spot if I lived closer.
__label__5	Only ordered by delivery, but I've easily had these place like 20 times. It was one of my go-tos when I worked a corporate job by International Plaza. The rocking roll is rockin' awesome and I always got a custom roll with spicy mayo. I don't eat raw sushi and am very happy with their cooked options!
__label__3	I want to love this location because it's the only drug store for quite some distance on South Street, but it's nothing special. The store just feels cramped, and it's not enjoyable looking around. On a positive note, the cashiers have always been pretty friendly.
__label__5	Such a wonderful surprise....we were treated like family and I am not just repeating a cliche here...the owners were so generous and kind! I haven't even mentioned the food yet...it was glorious! The family is from Venice and so they have brought their cooking traditions from that region.  Completely delicious...I would go back today except they are closed on Sundays...I'm serious...it's that good.
__label__4	"To be fair, I only tried their vanilla custard. I'm an ice-cream purist; I don't like brownies and marshmallows and god knows what else mixed into my ice cream.

That said, this was some of the best vanilla custard I've EVER had, and yes, I've had Ted Drewes. 

The drive thru was pretty quick. I'll definitely be back."
__label__4	Small restaurant with great food! For 4 adults + 2 kids. We ordered 4 dishes and 1 kids meal. They all came out great and we had too much food. The fried red snapper was very fresh and tasty. The food portion was big. So I would recommend watch out how much you order or order some dishes which will be ok for taking home. We only finished half of the seafood fried rice and had the left over for lunch. It came with a lot of seafood in the rice and just done right.
__label__4	Great meatballs, ok Greek salad. Maria is a pleasure to deal with, the elder gentleman behind the counter is a sort of endearing grumpy.  The fresh meats and sausage looked excellent and the selection of sandwiches impressive. I would return for sure.
__label__4	We stopped in for a beer and a snack. The brisket nachos were great! We ordered the half portion, which definitely looked like it could have been a full portion.
__label__4	"Really cool bar just far enough from the ""weird"" part of Bourbon to have a good crowd but close enough that you can include it in your French Quarter bar hopping."
__label__2	The decor is beautiful. But the service and food are not good. Sat for over 10 minutes waiting for someone to take drink order. Chicken was clearly frozen in both entrees.
__label__1	meh selection of drafts, realized right away not our kind of place with the loud pinball machines next to bar; I'm sure its great for folks who are into that
__label__2	Came by to get my truck washed the other day with high expectations.   The car wash is really nice and new so I had hoped it would do a really good job.  They had someone going over certain parts with a brush before the wash.  When I finished with the wash though my truck was still considerably dirty. There were spots where you could see the brushes had hit certain parts but didn't get the whole area.  I emailed what I believe is the owner or manager with no response.
__label__3	This use to be my happy hour spot.  Their calamari is delicious, serving is generous.  Came back today.  Calamari is less than of what it was before and 50% more expensive.
__label__1	Food was pretty good but the service was horrible. Server didn't check on us at all. He passed our table multiple times as we sat with empty glasses. My daughter slipped and fell on their floor. However, they still failed to clean up the spill that she slipped on. While walking to the restroom, we walked through a swarm of gnats.
__label__4	"This is one of the best elegant tea houses in Chinatown. The cakes were amazing. We had the durian crepe cake, green tea crepe cake, and the molten lava cake. The flavors were astonishing and very bursting with flavors. The decors of the place helped with the ambience and vibe; it was very sensual and extravagant. It makes you feel comfortable yet classy. 
The servers were very welcoming and kind. They took the time to satisfy our needs. They were very patient as this was our first time. Highly recommend and will come back!"
__label__4	Came here for breakfast before heading to the airport . We got seated right away. The menu had very good prices and good choices as well. I chose the strawberry crepes combo which came with 2 crepes, hashbrowns and a choice of meat. Our food came pretty quick and I ate every bit of my food. You also have to pay your bill at the front .
__label__5	Nails were done by Hien. Very professional and cozy environment. Friendly workers and very accommodating. They offer coffee, tea, wine and water.
__label__1	"Don't recommend using them again. They charge for materials not used. 
They don't put their estimate in writing. Then they have all kinds to excuses to overbill you."
__label__5	I am from out of town and just stumbled on this place. If you you want amazing culinary experience with bar food come here. The bacon wrapped onion rings are everything you would expect and so much more. Also had the pulled pork and short rib French dip. Blown away by everything. New York needs a place like this. The staff was friendly and helpful with selections. Local beers also are always a plus.
__label__5	Ok so I really enjoyed this tour... I don't remember the gentleman's name but he was so AWESOME, FUNNY,  AND FRIENDLY!!! Was a great and memorable experience I will never forget!!! Out of all the swamp tours I saw, this one was the closest to the French quarters and we Lyft there and back for not that much... cheaper than the shuttle.
__label__1	It was awful for me, the lady driver examiner should be more patient and more flexible.
__label__3	"It's OK. It's not terrible. I have had better, but I think the thing that saves this place is the portions and family style seating. Both go hand in hand. It's basically like a less done-up Buca di Beppo in Brandon. Huge portions because they expect you to share. Try the dishes with the sun-dried tomatoes. Delicious.

But, basically, if your family is in town and they don't mind Italian or sharing, then give this place a try."
__label__4	Very darn good ! Nice place to eat and a friendly staff, food was on point and came out quick too.
__label__3	Definitely try the fries and the assortment of ranch dips--very good! Buffalo chicken dip was also pretty good. If you're looking for a decent meal, don't expect too much. Mostly a selection of fried foods and appetizers. Better place to drink and maybe grab some appetizers. Expect it to be busy on Friday and Saturday.
__label__5	Was not originally going there for lunch, but our regular spot was busy so we decided to try Punch Burger because it was right next door. What a great decision.  The food was delicious and we didn't have to wait very long even though we had a large group.  I got the burnt cheese burger and it was sooooo good.  Will def be going back!
__label__1	"I was surprised.  I was expecting it to be ""ok"".

The food was actually pretty tasty and the service was as good as any other place I have had in New Orleans.  The guy playign music that night was a bit awkward but funny.

Get the Groupon/Living Social or Yelp deal.

Only complaint was the guy outside with the sign was unprofessional towards women."
__label__1	Walked in and saw about 8-10 people sitting at the bar having their drinks..  Ordered fish and chip special. I waited and waited..finally the meal arrived after 40 minutes of waiting. The  fish and fries were wet and soggy. . Showed it to the bartender, and I left.
__label__5	Kathy was the bomb and steered us to the yummy lobster roll. Good call and thanks Kathy!  Good luck to your pats!
__label__2	I stayed here 5 nights. It's a high-end hotel. The service was great. The location was phenomenal-- right off Canal. Unfortunately the place needs some upkeep. I'm a light sleeper, so I carry earplugs with me. The walls are really thin. And my hallway was loud. There were slways random thuds throughout the night. My curtains also could close all the way-- I like my room to be pitch black when I sleep. For these reasons I consider the stay to be subpar, 2 stars.
__label__1	"I am not giving these crooks even one star. Was told that my A/C was not registered and therefore not under warranty anymore. Unit is six years old. Also technician told me I have a leak and needed Freon. After getting a second opinion by another(fabulous) company was told I have no leak and do not need Freon. My warranty was confirmed for 4 more years! Also their maintenance fee is double .
This company is just in it for the money, always finding something you need to buy."
__label__5	Stopped by to satisfy a craving for Italian food and had visitors from out of town. My dad said it was the best spaghetti he's ever had and I thoroughly enjoyed my plate as well! I'll definitely be back for the warm and authentic Italian personalities and cuisine. Thank you!
__label__5	"Four words - Banana Foster French Toast. 

This dish is a must try in New Orleans and The Ruby Slipper Cafe does it right. The portion is easily able to be shared between two people. You will leave on a well earned sugar high. 

There is outdoor seating available!"
__label__2	I would not recommend AFFTON Diner. Their service was mediocre at best. I ordered an egg white veggie omelette and what came out was undescribable. It was a pile of grease covered veggies and cheese with some scrambled egg whites. When I asked about it they said that was their omelette. I had to turn it away. I then ordered 3 over medium eggs instead. The eggs came out runny, definitely not over medium. Do not go here.
__label__5	Very nice seeing local breweries getting noticed. The bartender at The Bulldog on Canal turned me on to their Milk Stout. It is one of the best stouts I have had. I'm looking forward to trying their other brews.
__label__5	David's guys did an amazing job installing our flooring! His workers cleaned up after they finished , as well as moved the furniture for us. The price was fair and they finished the job by the time frame they stated. I would totally recommend his company !
__label__5	If I could I would give this place 10000 stars!!! I called in a panic because my dip stick broke. Someone says just come on in let me look at it.   I get there and Nate gets his tools and starts working on it.  So patient and sweet!! Doesn't give up even when it's giving him problems. He gets it out!!!! Helps me order a new one and just had the best attitude!! I'm sold on AutoZone and especially this location!! Thank you so much for all your help!!!
__label__5	Fantastic dining experience! I recommend the stuffed chicken wings. Incredible! Shrimp and Grits were spot on!  Will definitely be back!
__label__1	"Trophy tavern is NOT biker friendly. NO colors are allowed
BIKERS BOYCOTT THIS BAR"
__label__3	"Very knowledgeable bar tender.
Interesting drinks and tasty. 
Hip interior and lounge feel.
Overall I liked the place.

What I didn't like was the crowd.  I just moved here and have been told over and over how nice and welcoming people are.  Well, not at this place.
I couldn't pay someone to talk to me between the sulking  douche  hipster  guy glued to his iphone to the others it was disappointed."
__label__5	Great place for young kids to celebrate Birthday party's private party rooms and super clean rest rooms !!
__label__5	Everything at Monsoon Chocolate is beautiful.  They have great desserts, the chocolate is wonderful, and the bon-bons make a perfect and special gift.  I especially appreciate that they make efforts to be a socially aware business.
__label__5	Came here for a conference happy hour and decided to be brave and order both the Trust Me cocktail and the Trust Me appetizer. You tell them what you won't eat/drink and they fashion something totally random and unbelievable for you. I ended up with a basil gin lemonade that made me dream of being in a sunny field full of wildflowers and shrimp and green bean tempura. Wondeful staff, amazing food, classy drinks. You won't regret a visit to Mimi's. Trust me.
__label__3	"Customer Service: The Customer Service is the best I have seen as far as fast food goes.

Presentation: Relatively Clean. Long Lines. Longer waiting time.

Price: Little high for fast food. 

Food: Great chicken. I recommend the simple chicken sandwich. Very Tasty! 

Me: Get the Chick-Fil-A calendar. Its full of a ton of coupons."
__label__5	I think the previous negative postings are totally bogus. We purchased one of their rentals and Jett and Garrett were very courteous and respectful. They went out of their way to make it an enjoyable experience.
__label__5	We've searched for YEARS for authentic Mexican food in Tampa FL...this is hands down the best Mexican food in Tampa!!
__label__5	Damn good steak. Bread is baked in house and really solid. Steak is the tastiest I've had. Best cheesesteak I've had in philly. Pizza fries were bomb too
__label__3	We went an hour before closing on a Friday. They were already very much in closing mode, which made the service less than desirable and the food to take a long time. Food was decent but didn't meet my expectations. I will try them again.
__label__5	Great Dunkin Donuts. Inside is clean and plenty of space to sit. Not busy either. Plenty of plugs with benches and tables to work at. Wifi works well. Nice place to get work done. Drive through coffee to for those moving quickly (or hauling kids).
__label__1	When will it open? It's August 1st and I thought it was supposed to open in July. Still looks closed.
__label__3	"We had 4 waiters bringing water, the food, taking our order and clearing plates. Wow. They were all very nice and called us ""sir"" and ""ma'am"". 

The red beans and rice was actually really good. I don't know why I thought it might be bland but there was a decent spice to it. The catfish po boy looked amazing, biggest piece of catfish I saw on a po boy all week.

I'd go back here for sure. Be aware that the menu in house is different than the current website PDF."
__label__4	Absolutely love this place!  My wife and I were in town for the weekend,  looked to Yelp for a brunch recommendation, chose FirstWatch because of the positive reviews and couldn't be happier!  Very friendly and prompt service and food was excellent with just the right variety.  Highly recommended,  keep it up FirstWatch!
__label__5	Who the hell is writing bad reviews on the Eagles.. HATERS.
__label__4	Performance during Sunday brunch is awesome! Make sure to have reservations. Grits is a little bit dry for me.
__label__1	Don't use these people.  I have American Home Shield and they used this company.  My compressor broke and no one has ever been in contact with me, its been almost two weeks.  Unprofessional and they do not protect their customers against covid, no mask wearing.  Horrible!!!
__label__5	We came here for brunch and the food was delicious!! We can't wait to come back and try more. This will definitely be a staple in the Point Breeze neighborhood!
__label__4	Love coming here for food and beers. Lots of vegetarian/vegan options which is awesome. My favorite dish though is the sauerkraut, pretzel brat platter. Dog friendly and overall a great spot for a few beers.
__label__5	I switched over to Dr. Spina's office after having a not-so-great experience with another dentist, and I've loved every visit. The wait is always very short, Dr. Spina and his staff are always friendly and helpful, and I always walk away with a good feeling about my visit, which is difficult to say about dental visits in general.
__label__5	Love this place!  We live about 30 min away and make sure we call in take out of salmon at least once a month!  Sugar cream pie is awesome and my wife loves the  lemonade shake ups
__label__5	Amazing burgers. Ordered just the classic Pharmacy burger and I loved it. Cooked amazing. Large portion of amazing hand cut/cooked fries. Food came fast and not. Overall and amazing meal!
__label__3	"After traveling all day, I wanted something familiar.  I found this place in proximity to my hotel so I figured I'd give it a shot. 

This place was nothing special or offensives. It was kind of crazy though; I was literally THE ONLY customer in the bar for an entire hour.  I sat at the bar to ensure consistent service.  The bartender was very friendly and my beers and wings were accurately provided.  

If I found myself in Indy on a Sunday night and wanted to avoid a crowd, I'd visit here again for sure.  Good wings and good beer."
__label__5	This is my favorite place to get Boba! They customize it exactly to your specifications even if it's not on the menu that way. I highly recommend it!
__label__5	"I'm from out of town and decided to eat here since they served the famous hot chicken.  Ended up getting the French toast and hot chicken meal and both were delicious.  I got the chicken ""Nashville hot"" since I prefer my food on the hotter side and everything I read said it's extremely hot. Even though it wasn't as hot as I was expecting it was still good.  The other person I was with ordered the chicken medium and it too had a good flavor"
__label__5	Very Professional, and did Not take advantage of me due to the fact the car needed more work, when they saw the transmission was bad they stopped and called me.
__label__2	EXTREMELY HIGH NOISE LEVEL.  For a table of seven, I could only talk to the two individuals next to me.  I couldn't even hear the waitress when she spoke to us at the other side of the table.  SO annoying the quality of the food was secondary.  PLEASE take the din out of our dining experiences.
__label__5	"All of the windows in our house were so old. We couldn't even open most of them. We passed by All Star Glass randomly and decided to go in and check prices. They were extremely affordable, so we took the plunge and ordered all 13 of our windows to be replaced. David and his crew were right on time. Fast workers and super friendly. They left after about 6 hours and our house was transformed. We walk around often and say out loud, ""Damn we love these windows!""... Couldn't be happier with this company and our new windows :)"
__label__3	Great wine selection! The food was mediocre at best though. But would definitely return to try out more of their red wine selection.
__label__5	"GREAT!!!! Professional, very artistic, the materials they use are the BEST, my sign I had made is now several years old, and it looks as though we just hung it, still just perfect!
Enjoyed working with them! (great price also)
Great company, you wont regret the call!  CALL THEM!"
__label__5	Visited for the first time today. Excellent, fresh, healthy food. The prices are fantastic. I had a large order and the friendly young woman working the counter put the entire order together, by herself, in a snap! She got everything right. I went back to work and a friend saw what we were eating and decided to go there herself. She texted me to thank me for the suggestion because she too was impressed by the food and service. Looks like I'll make Simple Green part of my lunch routine.
__label__5	Tiffany W was my server and she was AMAZING! She's probably the best server in the restaurant. She was attentive to us, but also helping with other servers tables. She needs to be a manager with her skills! So friendly! Can't wait to visit her again!
__label__4	Great lattes - I've tried the chai and the vanilla both very smooth and flavorful. Haven't had the food so I can't speak to that. Sharp decor - bookcase in the back and paint colors are nice touches.  Really like the overall vibe of this place.
__label__4	This place was nice. My date and I were put right in the front so we could see Chris Frangelo in all his glory. The house comedians were so funny! Parking is $20 on the lot right next to it. On weekends there is free parking in surrounding areas. It was a fun night!
__label__4	Visiting from the west coast, I decided to address some brown spots on my face. I chose Golden  Glow spa based on location and reviews. I got the BBL laxer treatment. I was very satisfied with the results! I have had this procedure before without such a good outcome. I found the facility nice, clean, professional and not pushy with the product sales. The 4 stars is because I don't like the practice of requiring a credit card to make an appointment. That said, I would return and recommend!
__label__4	Went on a monday night around 6pm, the place was quiet, better for a date night. I had a Florida roll, it was fresh and I really enjoyed it, the citrus touch was new and I really enjoyed it. Will definitely have to go back and order other rolls.
__label__5	So delicious! I can't believe I've lived here for 5 years and hadn't been here before tonight. Great staff. Amazing food. Fair prices. Can't wait to go back!
__label__3	This is a pretty standard hole in the wall middle eastern restaurant . Not the best but not bad. The service is rather slow though.
__label__4	"Good food. I usually pick up but the service is nice. I wish they put more crispy noodles with your order. I love the egg drop soup but has any veggie in it. Would be great with some greens even for the color of it. 
Like them."
__label__4	"Just stopped in after the newly remodeled restaurant re-opened.  Bravo! The new space looks great. The service was friendly and efficient in moving people along.  The chili was awesome as usual!  

Stop in and see the new digs!"
__label__3	This place was right on the corner from where our hotel was. Coffee was very good. But the raspberry, white chocolate scone didn't taste like a scone... was soft like a muffin and scones are suppose to be like a biscuit. My husband's blueberry scone was the same.
__label__1	"Terrible experience 

We had to wait a long time for the car and all the service people were cranky.  They would not even give us an estimate as to how long it would take to get the car. 

The only good thing is that it's cheap."
__label__2	Made an appointment a month in advance for an international health certificate and was told it was not a problem. As I go for my appointment they said they don't do the certificates and put my family in a very difficult position for traveling possibly resulting in my dog being quarantined in another country. They said they tried calling but apparently they couldn't even copy down my phone number correctly. Done with this place and their continued mistakes. But at least the receptionist seemed sorry...
__label__1	Bad Customer service ... being rushed the whole time when dining in ... severs really rude .. treated our table really poorly . also dictated if we were to tip them or not while we were sitting 2 inches away from them ...
__label__4	"We went there on Sunday for lunch and there was no wait. We were seated immediately. It's a nice small place and the workers are nice. 

As soon as we filled out our form on what foods we wanted it truly was a quick process. As soon as we finished one dish the removed the empty plates and the new dish was out. Honestly I think we stayed there for about 45 min at most. The food was delicious and I'd definitely go back."
__label__4	"The food is reasonably priced and the menu also has an ala carte option as well. Chips and salsa are complimentary with the purchase of an entree. 
Great drink Specials too! My husband ordered steak and shrimp fajitas and I ordered an enchilada and hard shell taco. Everything tasted very good. The manager also stopped by our table to make sure we were happy. He was very nice and sincere. I will definitely return."
__label__4	We were staying in gaylord hotel. We actually were headed downtown but missed lunch so we grabbed sushi sat down and ate. The hostess was rude we about walked before we were seated. The food was delicious and was fast. What we needed before we left.
__label__1	Totally rude manager...we arrived prior to happy hour and was seated prior to happy hour.  We waited for our waitress to order our food.  Once we ordered a couple appetizers from happy hour , as well as our dinner, he would not honor the half price apps.  So long story short, he just lost our business and my families so he saved a total of $3.
__label__5	Really cool decor and huge TVs to keep the non-bowlers occupied. Overall a great place for a fun night out! :)
__label__4	Cozy little restaurant in the heart of downtown Reno. Loved the atmosphere and the food was great! Please support this lovely little eatery.
__label__2	"On a tip from a friend we were told that Marshalls carried mens shoe sizes over size 13 (we were looking for size 15) so we decided to drop by.  This store is in the same strip center area where Best Buy is located at Drew St. and US19 in Clearwater.

They do have a mens shoe dept, however they only had one style of over size 13 shoe.  In the future, I don't think that we'll be circling back to see if they have any more larger sized shoes."
__label__5	Showed up on time after the courtesy call stating eta. Was professional and polite. Worked quickly. Great service.
__label__5	"This place is a cute little restaurant tucked in the side of the children's museum in city park. Although I believe it's main purpose is to serve guests of the museum it is open to all. There is beautiful outdoor seating and well as family- friendly seating inside. They have many family events such as egg decorating during Easter. The food was incredible and I was completely blown away by the cauliflower ""wings"". The homemade pop tart is so flaky and delicious. They also have a picnic lunch on their menu which can be taken to go and enjoyed in city park!"
__label__4	I stayed away from the Korean and Thai dishes and ordered the dumpling dim sum combo along with their lemongrass chicken rice bowl and complementary spicy noodles. I was pleasantly surprised by how poised the dishes were in flavor. The spices were right on, nothing under or over salted, grilled or steamed well. Unsure whether the dumplings are constructed in house, but they are tasty nonetheless. All in all, I would definitely come back to try some other rice bowls or noodle dishes!
__label__3	Great environment and very friendly bartenders / wait staff. The food leaves a little to be desired, though. We had just eaten at Sang Kee a few days before, and by comparison all the food we ordered at Shanghai Station just didn't make the cut.
__label__5	First time here. We had never been to NOLA before but this place was recommended and did not disappoint. Vanessa & Don are the bomb. From the moment we walked in, they were extremely welcoming. Vanessa treated us like she has known us and helped me (super indecisive) make the decision to get the pulled pork and brisket. Did not disappoint. Try this place out.
__label__4	Felix's is in a really convenient location. We were seated immediately on a Thursday late night and our server, Asante, was super helpful and had a great personality. I ordered a chicken ceasar salad as did my best friend and our other friend got charred oysters which she didn't really like. Overall, a nice spot and the pricing wasn't too bad.
__label__5	Went last night. Service, food and drinks were all outstanding! Our servers Veronica and Mark were excellent and fun! The soft shell crab appetizer was ridiculous. We had the Lamb shank and Chilean sea bass. Never tasted anything so amazing. If you want a remarkable dining experience Akar is a must.
__label__5	"This pharmacy is absolutely delicious. I went there for my first time a few weeks ago and I can't wait to go back. I ordered just a regular pharmacy burger with tater tots. SO. GOOD. You can't go wrong with a burger and tots. The food was fresh and the burger was cooked just right. 

The food here is not the only thing they have going for them- they also have a great beer selection! And not to mention, a really cool beer garden. The food and atmosphere at the pharmacy is well worth the wait! 5 stars!"
__label__4	"In our nine years in the area, Dominic's
 is the best we've found. And there are good places around. But here the combination of crust, sauce and toppings comes together in a really great way. Our favorite is the mushroom and black olive pizza but meat lovers will find what they want. It's a crowded parking lot but worth the visit."
__label__5	The best street taco place in all of East Bay. This place beats the Taco Bus, hands down! The ambience is not so great, but who cares when you get authentic Mexican goodies.
__label__5	"We got lots of things and it was all yummy. The atmosphere was cool. The service was good. There is free parking in a small lot behind the building but it was full and there is plenty of metered street parking. 

I could easily see this becoming a spot I frequent because it was tasty, not too pricey, and had chill vibes."
__label__3	"I enjoy the simplicity of the scents in the item's of here at The Body Shop. The layout of the store is extremely minimalist, which I can appreciate.
The employees are always attentive, but I just don't have interest in spending full price on these items when I have essential oils at home."
__label__5	Really great time for kids and adults. Randy was fun and entertaining. There were many kinds of animals and the overall experience was great.
__label__1	Customer service was trash. The front desk girl was very condescending & unwelcoming. I called ahead and even made a appointment online, and was told to come in at 8:30. The girl in the front had a nasty attitude & i would recommend to stay away and not waste your coins... OR TIME. We drove 3 hours for this for this...
__label__1	The Provence in Nashville is fantastic, this one is complete garbage. They didn't have real food so I overplayed for a kind bar and instant oatmeal. My late tasted like it was made with water not steamed milk. Staff was nice but go to Starbucks... I'm sure burger kings coffee is better
__label__2	Customer service was good ...but the diner was very dirty trash and debris all over the floors making it very hard to enjoy my meal the food was ok at best. I will not be going back.
__label__3	Cheesesteaks are good, not great but good, a standard cheesesteak if you're from NJ or Philly but good compared to FL variety. There are plenty of places around town that are comparable so not worth the extra time to go there from say St Pete but if I'm passing by I would stop in again, bar area is nice. Next time I'll try their Cuban.
__label__1	"don't live there
the noise of construction on your neighbor every day
you think if you call the manager they will stop working in the morning
no they won't"
__label__5	Seven Campbell was excellent to work with for the purchase of a BMW. Seven went above and beyond my expectations.
__label__3	"I visit MP because it over looks the marina I belong to. I've only had burgers there, but have heard that wings are good. 

I most appreciate the house DJ's that come through as well as the live talent that they have."
__label__4	"1. Love the beer selection.
2. Best place to go during the firemen's convention ;)
3. Great live music by Jay Elliot on Tuesday night's!!

Service has always been prompt and friendly, this is my favorite Tuesday night place to grab a Smithwick's and listen to live, local tunes."
__label__1	"food was terrible the Chicken cheesesteak was so bland the chicken was rubbery & tasted like it was frozen 

do not recommend"
__label__2	Was craving a juicy burger so came in here ordered the Glory Burger. Burger was cooked as ordered, but the egg was over cooked, no runny yolk. It wasn't a busy night at all, but our bar tender either ended their shift or disappeared because never saw her again after we ordered. Very disappointed.
__label__5	True authentic excellent homemade German cooking! Fabulous schnitzel!!! Wonderful atmosphere!!! Lovely staff!!! I have never been more compelled to write a Yelp review, it is THAT amazing. P.S. make reservations!!!!!!
__label__5	I love Squeeze In! Love, love, love it! Always busy, so have to plan ahead of time, but so grateful for the delicious quality on food and experience.
__label__5	Unique, fresh and vegan (or not if you wish).  It's a little tucked away in Newtown boro, but definitely worth the effort to locate if you want fresh and tasty!!
__label__5	The food is excellent. We ordered our food for delivered our food and it arrived with in 30 minutes! The food was fresh and delicious!! We got a large pizza and garlic knots. YUM!!!
__label__4	Food was good, but not great. This is better option than most other airport food locations.
__label__1	"Make sure you get everything in WRITING from Jaunita.  She will screw you over big time.  She told me that they would charge a one time deep cleaning of 200.00 and then 75.00 every 2 weeks.

She charged my card 275.00 and 85.00 for first cleaning.  

She is a thief, she comes off all professional and has her stuff together but she is just fronting to suck you in.

She said she would email me everything we discussed over the phone and I was stupid enough to trust and give her my card #.

Beware folks."
__label__4	"Met a friend here for lunch. They had a cute front outdoor patio and back patio to sit at plus seats inside. It's a cute spot for lunch. You order inside and they bring your food to you. They had an amalgam of meats and cheeses on display plus lots of local treats like crackers, jams, cheese knives, etc for sale. 

I got the soup of the day and a salad. Both were yuhmmy. Atmosphere was quiet and pleasant. Very neat place!"
__label__4	Lots of fun. Wish it was labeled better and more organized. Could stay here all day. Fairly well priced as long as you don't go nuts.
__label__5	Not only did they figure out a faulty charger plug was the issue--which cost us nothing, they were patient and took time with us to show us how to back up data to the cloud.  The folks at CPR are very honest and kind in my view!
__label__2	"I came here and got a salad and a iced coffee and ended up spending almost $19. My coffee was mostly ice with a hint of mocha. I asked for oat milk instead of regular milk and I had to pay an extra dollar.... for what? The salad was pretty good but definitely not worth $11. Although both 
of my items tasted good I still feel like I got ripped off. Not sure if I'm going to come back here, I think I'll stick to Red Kettle in Summerland. They have a great staff and reasonable prices."
__label__5	Their dough is amazing, soft, fresh and cooked perfectly, and there's plenty of cheese. If you're a garlic lover, I suggest their Great white pizza. The calamari I must admit was a bit lack luster in the flavor department.. needs some seasoning but I appreciate that their calamari is fresh and meaty, the marinara for them alone was delicious. Glad I came across this place, will be ordering from them again :o)
__label__4	I ordered a little bit of everything and enjoyed the food.  I would go back for the street tacos.  One downside was the smoke from the grill.
__label__5	Real. good. food. Execution is spot on. Ingredients are quality. Plus they have beer on tap.
__label__3	I love the sushi here but this is not a place to come if you have 4 or more in your party. We had 6 and were sat in the back at a U shaped table with bench seating. It was very uncomfortable. We were in the restaurant for 1 hour and 45 minutes. That is unacceptable for lunch. It took forever to get our food and then it took even longer to get the check. I think it would be better and faster with a small group.
__label__1	"I would give them a 0 rating,  if it was available. They pre charged $150.00  and then made me wait 2 hours in the lobby.   Finally got into a room where they said "" We don't handle this type of thing here"" . They would not refund my $150.00 and it was too late for me to get into another doctor."
__label__2	"The muffeletta  and pimms cup drink were greet. However the service was horrible! The bartender ignored my mom, sister and I for 15 minutes without ever acknowledging us. When I finally had to ask for a seat he was rude and never asked us if we wanted to sit inside or outside. He sat us inside. When I asked if we could sit outside he said, "" your close enough!"" how rude. He looked into the outdoor courtyard and said, ""nope full."" but it wasn't full. You all need to bump up you friendliness and customer service!!"
__label__5	Convenient location and super clean business. Been going to Phil for 10 years and he's hands down the most professional barber. Given that there is a global pandemic, this barbershop is one of the only ones actually taking appropriate measures by wearing masks and checking temps. The bonus is there are no walk ins right now so you don't have to worry about too many people. Most convenient part is being able to book an appointment on the app. Go see Phil at the best shop in town!
__label__3	The look of the roof top dining area will draw you in, but the overall interior finishings will leave you wishing you chose somewhere else. They are trying to compete with the other brew pubs and gastro pubs in Midtown, but they're just not there yet. The food is good enough satisfy your hunger, but not good enough to make up for the disappointing decor and vibe.
__label__5	Steak prepared to perfection and seasoned nicely. Servers are zipping here and there yet pause to see if everything is good. Busy. Noisy
__label__3	Traveling to New Orleans and was looking for a good place to work - somewhere with healthy food options, solid wifi, plentiful tables, and outlets. HiVolt delivered! I removed one star because there is no water station and the kitchen got my order wrong - I asked for dressing on the side and very minimal quinoa on my ozzie breakfast bowl. It was delicious, but I don't like wasting food and had to leave a lot of what I didn't ask for on the plate!
__label__5	Ballet Idaho is one of Boise finest entertainments. All of the performances showcase the strength, technique, and artistry of the dancers. You can enjoy an up close, intimate performance at the Esther Simplot Performing Arts with contemporary pieces or see a full length ballet at the Morrison Center. Some performances include live music by local bands or the Boise Philharmonic. Other performances include their academy students from ages 6-17. Bring the whole family or a date for a special and memorable affair. Ticket deals can sometimes be found on living social, groupon, or in local coupon ads. See a performance this November through April!
__label__5	"This place was awesome. Lots of great merch, very welcoming environment, amazing coffee and the donuts are a MUST! 
If I lived in town, I would be frequenting this place weekly if not daily."
__label__4	I must say that this place had the best crepe that I've ever had. The crepe itself is really good, but once you had Nutella and fresh strawberries and bananas it's even better. It's worth a try. I must thank Angela R. for recommending this place to me.
__label__4	I'm going to disagree with some of the negatives here.  Pico is a very cute little spot with great atmoshpere.  The prices are great for a sit-down spot on South St., and no one at my table was unhappy with his or her food.
__label__5	Great school who gets you prepared to pass your testing.  I did a review course with them, and although they aren't the cheapest, they do get the job done.
__label__5	So close to my work, I can just walk down and get something quick & healthy. Always a great experience.
__label__2	this place was okay 2 stars for me because staff is not very friendly when are food was brought to the table the styrofoam was so greasy he almost dropped our food we said thank you for him bringing it over and we didn't get a your welcome just turn around and walked away the prices are okay but they should have a drink with it but being there was no drinks in the fridge and no refills on sweet tea we just waited till we got finished eating and went somewhere else to get something to drink I probably won't be back to this place
__label__1	Mm...tiny dry hamburger and measly bag of cardboard tasting chips for almost $12.50. Great. This is actually the second time I've been here but the first time getting food. The first time I waited at the front for five minutes and people were in the back but no one came to greet me or take my order so I left. Don't waste your money...but your own organic and grass fed beef at Whole Foods and take the extra time to make your own.
__label__4	The food was good. Waiter talk us into eating oysters (fried & char-boil). Never eating them before and don't plan on it again. My husband didn't like either, char-boil was ok to me. I'm happy I tried them plus I got to see them being char-boil. Which was pretty cool.
__label__4	Pretty good all the way around.  Good drinks, food, service and the ambiance is fantastic.  I say only four stars because I felt like the menu was a little limited for a place of that size and price range.
__label__5	This pizza is excellent. Worth every penny more than a 5 dollar pizza at Little Caesars. As a college student I am especially sensitive to price and it is very reasonable for such quality.
__label__2	Service was horrible. Food was ok some cold some warm.  Finally got a refill as I was paying.  Never came back to check on us and steaks were cooked wrong. Never got asked about stripes card
__label__5	Good food, inexpensive drinks and awesome serve! I recommend this place to anyone looming for affordable drinks and a cool Atmosphere.
__label__4	After driving by so many times we finally decided to stop in with the family. We were promptly seated and a server arrived immediately to get our drink order. Our server was the best part of our experience. She was so friendly, had perfect timing, and gave us the absolute best service!! My group consisted of picky eaters, so we settled for egg fried rice, orange chicken and sweet and sour pork. They were all good... a little to sweet for my taste, but good. I will definitely be back though and next time I will be sure to check out their Szechuan dishes!
__label__1	"I drove here 30 minutes based on reviews to have pizza here. The sign on door as well as yelp stated that the place closes at 3am on sat night. It is 11p and the guy inside said he was closed. How the Eff is this possible in a college campus. 
This left a bad taste in my mouth and I ain't coming back. If the service is inconsistent, then I ain't betting on the pizza."
__label__5	Very Friendly. I had 6 suit jackets cleaned, two full suits tailored and cleaned. They were willing to help accommodate my schedule. I had the date for Wednesday and then asked if they could move it to Tuesday. Not only did they have it done in time, everything was done beautifully. They are my new dry cleaners from here on out for how they handled this situation. I highly recommend.
__label__5	What a treat! Right here in our own neighborhood. My husband and I stopped in to give it a try and it has become a favorite. The staff is friendly but the star is the pizza! The toppings are generous, fresh and hot. The taste is scrumptious and the texture satisfying. We have ordered the thin crust and the thrown, or rolled thicker crust. Both are delicious. The wings are yummy, too. We were not impressed with the toasted ravs, but you might like them-matter of taste maybe. We are so glad Amore is here!
__label__5	This place is more up scale inside, however I think you could go in casually dressed. The food was delicious. They have a kids menu which is very well priced and comes with a free sundae. They also have crayons and game placemat which I wouldn't expect at a nicer place but is certainly appreciated for the kids. We had the crime brûlée French toast which was amazing and the Ahi which was also so tasty. The price for our food at lunch wasn't too bad either. Everyone we were with was happy and we would try this place again.
__label__5	Update:  Returned to this location.  The pickup amenities are perfectly located around the side w a dedicated entrance.  This makes much more sense.  Very please to be back at Longhorn and see the improvements.  We love Longhorn!
__label__3	Great patio and nice folks to service the place. I had the jambalaya and liked it but wasn't knocked down by it. The spice will start to catch up a little after a while so hang in there if you're into that sort of thing.
__label__3	"I had dinner here with my family. I am not really fond of the food here. Maybe because the food is too authentic for me, so as an outsider for food, I don't want to make comments on food. 
Instead, I do approve they have pretty good alcohol products. They have lots of choices of wines, and not like other restaurants, they have dessert whiskey which I highly recommend. The Italian cocktails are fantastic as well.
I will definitely visit again for the alcohol products."
__label__5	The TN Hot chicken sliders were very good, and hot nicely spicy.  Side of fries also excellent.
__label__5	Excellent food.  Great friendly staff.  Just plain good . Im probably a little biased.  Im there everyday.
__label__3	Pleasant enough all around but, to be honest, I've had better. I'd shell out a little bit extra for expert hands/methods.
__label__2	Ate here often until I got there early one day and saw them heating up pizzas that were obviously from the day before. Never really liked the reheat method they used because I was never sure how long the pizza was in the window before I got there. Plenty of better food choices in the area. If they can't be bothered to make food fresh I can't be bothered to eat there.
__label__2	Great atmosphere, cheerful bartender/waitress, had to let the my eye glasses adjust to the lighting. Order the pretzel and cheese, it was very good. The wife order the grilled cheese with bacon and I ordered the oyster poor boy. The grill cheese was overpowering bread favor, couldn't taste the cheese and there was no bacon. The oysters were deep fried burnt and tasted greasy. Will not go back at this time. Two hours later still burping greasy oysters. Doggy bag to go and there was no complaints from the pups.
__label__3	"Okay without a doubt this place has delicious food (especially brunch), exciting drinks, and a great atmosphere (though loud). The problem is good luck getting a seat without waiting at least 45 minutes. 

This place is so packed (especially during brunch hours) that even on a normally quiet Wed night, it is crazy packed and the only seating available is the bar. 

Just saying... want the experience... you will have to wait. Otherwise a really fun place."
__label__4	"It is great that they are available for emergencies . Very professional, immediately acknowledged and pet was taken care of within 5 minutes of walking in the door.  They will suggest what they recommend for appropriate diagnosis and treatment  The owner has choices and final decision on how they proceed. You get what you pay for. I have taken a pet there and left paying $500 but also they have taken care of another pet with a  cost of $8000. Both cases ended in success.
I highly recommend for your pet emergencies or special care."
__label__1	This is the worst company I have ever been in contact with. For the past three months I have desperately tried to work with them and schedule for my washer machine to be fixed, and every time they are supposed to come they somehow manage to fuck everything up. I highly recommend going anywhere else. Their customer service is garbage, their phone line is always busy, and somehow their schedule is always booked so you can never reschedule within a reasonable time period. I repeat, do not use this company.
__label__5	Having a consistently great place to hangout, get awesome food and drinks, and be waited on by crafty mixologists and knowledgeable waiters truly makes it a 10/10 experience. If you're in the drexel hill area and looking for a great vibe , station tap is the place to go. I highly recommend their mussels. Will be back this week!
__label__5	Wow!  Chocolates galore and beautiful evening out at the Grand Sierra. Very organized event with plenty of outstanding caterers and entertainment.  Lively event!  We had a great time with friends and tried an interesting raspberry beer that was absolutely delicious.  I would recommend if you are having a party, order the cronuts that have Baileys chocolate infused liquor you pump in when you are ready to eat it--amazing and heavenly.
__label__5	Food was great! Definitely a hidden gem for bar food. Cheesesteak eggroll was crispy and cheesy... But you'll only get one, which I think was just right as an appetizer. French onion soup was flavorful and delicious. Fish and chips tasted like they were right from Ireland... Yummy batter and very crispy... Will keep this spot in mind for an easy night out. Decently priced for a quick bite to eat
__label__2	Disappointing. Had high expectations after all of the reviews and magazine write-ups. Our group of 7 got there about 20 min before closing. Staff let us know they were closing before we placed our orders. Seated next to open garage door at 56 degree temps. Asked to have it closed and denied. Food was below expectations; a hair in one of the rolls. The latke flavorless; I did not like the pork belly bacon, needed a steak knife to cut it. Biscuits were really good. Mimosas were good. Bloody marys ok. Won't make the trip back there.
__label__4	"Fun unique spot in Tampa with a view of the water. Especially nice when there is good weather. 

It's a cool spot to watch the cruise ships leaving in the later afternoon too. 

Live music on the weekends and sometimes during the week. This place is happening on Lightning game nights. Food is available through Splitsville and the pizza is pretty good for bar food. 

Bar staff is super nice, friendly and accommodating. Cold beer, good drinks and especially great bloody Mary's!"
__label__5	Silvo's is the place I can buy for their best cheesesteaks which I usually recommend to my out-of-town friends to buy to make their trips memorable. It's the only place that they make their own bread and the way they cook the meat and cheese is a 10+!  Even this place do airlifts of cheesesteaks to Iraq for the American solders.
__label__5	This ice cream is rich, creamy and all kinds of old fashioned deliciousness. This ice cream is made from organic milk from happy grass-fed cows, free of artificial ingredients and they pasteurize their own ice cream on site. Aside from that, I just love the super rich and flavorful ice cream. It's so rich that I'm good with the kids size portion. If your indecisive, go for the ice cream flight to get a mini taste of a variety of flavors. They are also gracious enough to let you sample before you commit! Locally owned and locally made!
__label__5	"1 chicken bacon quesadilla (green chili, Mexican creme, bacon). 1 al pastor quesadilla. They each came with a bean soft shell taco. The flour tortillas are home made & you can definitely tell! Yum! This place is a great hole in the wall with awesome food, great people, great service!
The bean tacos are very good too."
__label__1	Service was slow. My server was very unprofessional.  Steak was undercooked and sides were bland.
__label__3	A surprisingly large and decent beer selection and some outdoor space made this place a pretty good place out for an hour or so.  Could've benefited from a heat lamp outside, but the early March temperatures were still tolerable. The giant games - jenga and connect 4, seemed fun, but the crowd was already rowdy at 7pm and we had to duck to avoid being hit by flying jenga blocks more than once.
__label__5	So many trolleys and not a single cookie that was promised. Beginning to think those Christmas cookie runners are a farse to lure us out.
__label__5	"We have been clients with Western Exterminator Tucson for some time. We continue to be extremely satisfied with the service and our technician Robert. Robert represents this agency well--he is professional, personable and punctual. When Robert sets his appointments, he is absolutely on time. Whenever there has been a specific concern, Robert/Western have addressed the issue in an expedient manner. We will continue to be loyal customer with Western and your employee Robert should be commended.

Ruth A."
__label__1	If you need a tow, call AAA. This company used to operate out of the Shell station at West Napoleon and transcontinental. The gas station shut down, and automotive service was so poor that it also went out of business. Now they are relegated to a tow truck.  They have to stake places out in order to garner business. It's just a sad situation for somebody to have to exist like that.
__label__5	Went to lunch the other day. Wonderful!!! We had salads, falafel, olives and hummus. Everything was fresh, and there were lots of things to purchase and cook with at home. Owners were friendly,restaurant was clean. Will definitely go back!!!
__label__1	"Years ago when the owner worked here it was great.  The last few visits I have not seen the owner.  The quality of the food and the service have decreased significantly.

There are much better options.  I won't be back."
__label__5	We dined at Eddie V's last night. It is our place for Anniversary and other special events. Steaks and seafood are top shelf. The filet and lobster tail are especially good. Ask for Maria - her service was outstanding!!
__label__4	"Checked into this hotel late on Friday night. There was definitely more of a younger ""party scene"", so if you are looking for a quiet getaway, this is definitely not your spot. The rooms were spacious and the beds were fairly comfortable. Overall nice amenities...Staff was very friendly and helpful. A true ""4-star"" solid hotel, but certainly lacking in some of the amenities that would make this hotel one I would return to with excitement."
__label__4	Ordered a vegetarian taco- poblano chili and a tostada with carné y queso. The vegetarian taco was so flavorful and the meat tostada was delicious. I can't wait to return to work my way through their menu. Seriously the best taco I've had in a while. Corn tortillas were bomb!
__label__4	We went for brunch on a Saturday. The place was packed and you may need a reservation. The waitress was just ok. The food was pretty darn good. We had the bacon wrapped shrimp, bacon cinnamon rolls, and I had the Nashville hot chicken with French toast. The mimosa deal is horrible. You get an entire bottle of champagne and 4 ounce glass of juice to mix it. The ratio is horrible...especially since they advertise the 4 ounce glass of juice as a carafe. This is not a carafe.
__label__1	Poor customer service staff vary rude would never recommend going there from checkin to picking up the car staff was nothing but rude
__label__5	The servers and the food are AMAZING! They take covid-19 very serious here! One of the best places to get a great burger or if your feeling chicken they have it all. !
__label__4	"Food is delicious - happy to have a great Mexican restaurant in Metairie.

Their Margaritas could use some work..."
__label__5	Absolutely phenomenal. Everything is good, no really, everything. Every time I go I order the whole market fish, last time it was fried speckled trout and grilled redfish w/ salsa verde. Both were out of this world, it's the best seafood restaurant I've been to since I was in Boston.
__label__1	The line is huge and I have never seen slower cashiers checking out. They are leaning on the counters slowly removing hangers, and stopping to talk to one another.
__label__4	"Our local ""go to"" for Sunday brunch. Nice walk to & from. Outdoor patio, dog friendly. Great wait staff . 
My fav is French toast combo & sweetheart has lots of healthy choices for her."
__label__5	What a wonderful little coffee shop. The 2 people behind the counter are very friendly and courteous. The breakfast sandwich was perfectly toasted. Sometime Cuban sandwiches get too toasted and hard to bite, not here. I will come back and try the coffee soon
__label__5	One of my favorites venues in the world. No place like it to catch a quick 45 min set of Dixieland. And, hey, they added some more fans or the semblance of air conditioning. It wasn't 110 degrees in there this week. Bravo!
__label__4	Delicious Italian meal! Must-try spaghetti and meatballs that have cheese at the center. We also ordered the rigatoni alla vodka & shaved salad to start. Everything was beyond delicious. Service was attentive. We were offered to sit inside or in the heated patio area and opted for the patio which was intimate and romantic. Definitely check out Little Nonna's and make a reservation!
__label__5	Sam was AMAZING this weekend! He did such an amazing job with our wedding. We got non stop compliments on how great he was. The photo booth they provided was a big hit. I can't say enough wonderful things. Thank you so much Sam & CSE for making the wedding of our dreams come true! He played every song we requested and when someone requested a song I had on a do not play list he came up to find me and ask if he could play it- now that's caring about a bride! Seriously, hire them. You won't regret it!!
__label__3	It's was a good taco but not a good value. Being a local I was a bit sticker shocked that two tacos and a drink was over $20
__label__1	The room was tiny, the towels were awful (only 2 bath towels, 1 hand towel and 1 washcloth for 2 people. The ONLY saving grace was the afternoon desk clerk. He was helpful. Would not stay there again. And they put a $150 hold on credit card for possible damages. Wrong.
__label__1	Waited for over an hour to sign up for a checking account I recommend vantage west. Please read other comments and reviews about this bank before signing up for any accounts with them
__label__4	"This is my third time at Panda Express and have been very pleased with the fast service and friendly staff. I was also pleased that Panda Express supports Houston and is collecting money to send for relief efforts. 
The line can be ling at times but the service is usually fast.  I will continue to take my family there."
__label__1	Terrible experience. Called and was told cab in my area, expect 20 minute wait. I called 20 minutes later and was told no cabs, expect at least 15 more minutes. Then the dispatcher admitted that they really could not tell me anything and that it could be much longer. No one there cared at all. Terrible customer service.
__label__1	"Went there for the first time to try the Cuban sandwiches. There was 1 lady working the deli that gave the word ""slow"" a new definition. Waited 45 minutes to order. It didn't help when customers ask for $2.00 worth of turkey or $1.00 worth of cheese. Meat and fruit are very reasonable but the seafood looked OLD ..I must say the Cubans aren't bad either."
__label__5	Finally got to try this place out. The food was rather good and I'm saying this after I just returned from Athens, Greece. Everything was fresh and tasty and the facility was nice a clean. I just wish my Mythos beer was served colder, not room temp.
__label__1	Made an appointment online on Friday for 10am Sunday.  The request for appointment included what size tires I wanted 235/45R19 95H.  I got a confirmation of my appointment.  Online they showed the were in stock.  Got there on Sunday for my appointment there were no tires available.  They checked their other stores but they did not have them stock either.  I asked why they confirmed my appointment if the tires were in available or at least call me so I would not have to make the trip for nothing.  I am not a happy camper.  Now I have to start over.
__label__5	Tara just completed a stunning tattoo on me. Black and white, soaring sparrow, customized until it was perfect. The tattoo is small and elegant, so precision was key. Tara over delivered. It's simply gorgeous. There was no pressure from her to make it larger, and I really appreciated that she respected my wishes. I will recommend her to everyone! The shop is immaculate, and I was completely comfortable that they employed the best hygiene practices. Please check it out!
__label__1	Do not order from here right now. Over an hour wait for a to go order and bd must pay in advance. Hoping they canceled my order like thru said they would. If you cant keep up, dont open and steal people's money.
__label__5	Took less than 30 minutes to get an oil change. It was about the same price as the dealership which surprised me but I didn't have to wait 2 hours like the dealership. Will be back.
__label__1	Slow waitresses took ten damn minutes to get a beer at the bar a beer for Christ sakes still hasn't gotten a bill been sitting here done eating  on vacation for WI Nvr coming here again
__label__5	Wonderful service, an adorable store, and great prices.  Cheaper than Petsmart groomers and they do a MUCH better job, we love this place!
__label__5	Dinner was amazing. We tried it all: crab bisque, mussels, marmont ribeye, mushrooms, cowboy ribeye topprd with crab, mashed potatoes, risotto, bread, drinks. Everything was FANTASTIC. Our server Lisa was spot on with her recommendations and friendliness. This place ranks amongst the top of my list for a fantastic steak dinner!
__label__3	The name says enough The King...always had good pizza for decades...not like the Nasty the King of Nasty New York Style Pizza stay far away from that place...there food will put you on toilet for Days..TRUST me...it's not worth it...Keep up the good work KOP!!!!..
__label__1	Not happy about this place. Had the corned beef hash and it was full of grizzle and the place smelled like spoiled fish.
__label__4	Yummy food, great service. I'm a fan for sure.
__label__5	Great rolls. Fun place to go with friends. Awesome environment, and the service was fast.
__label__1	They weren't rude, but why advertise something if you don't have it? Want a macchiato? Sorry, machine is down (okay, I get it, things break down). So I try to order another specialty coffee - sorry not available yet. Um, why is it even advertised AT this location? Waste of my time.
__label__5	All that Jazz that New Orleans pours into the streets and their culture has found its way into one sandwich! You can eat New Orleans here, not literally.  You must try their spicy dirty rice as well.  I was looking for a great place in the city to get it and finally I found this sandwich shop, tucked in the back of a convenience store.  They are cash only so come prepared or go home I satisfied.  They do have an atm though!
__label__4	This place has great service and awesome entertainment for a fun night on the town. I am obsessed with seafood and this is the place I always favor cause of the location on state.
__label__5	Absolutely delicious! Our server was great and all of the rolls were fresh and tasted great. My husband had the burrito which was make your own and was very tasty. I also highly recommend the tuna dumplings as an appetizer.
__label__5	Friendly staff, decent prices, solid food, patio seating - what more can you ask for? $20 house margarita pitchers, that's what! Ordered chicken fajitas because it was 'buy 1, get one 1/2 price' fajita night - did not come out on a sizzling skillet but was very good anyways - large portion with good sides, especially the pico de gallo and beans (both black beans and refried beans are solid). Will be back!
__label__5	"New Orleans is home to some of the best local brew out there, and while I can't say each one is my favorite, I do have many; French Truck is somewhere at the top of that list. The coffee is always consistent and so so fresh. I believe they use Gracious Bakery for some of their baked offerings and I love that...NOLA embraces supporting local like no other.

I've had all sorts of drinks at FT but none so delicious as their Oji drip coffee. It's darker than my soul and will have you bouncing right out the door with the first sip!"
__label__4	"Came for dinner and had the pork belly special and a fried chicken slider. Delicious, really well thought out and different from standard burger fare. It's BYOB for dinner.

Also had a couple of donuts and coffee on a different (breakfast) visit. Really solid and creative as well."
__label__4	Ordered a root beer float blended, was seeing stars it was so good! Staff was very nice.
__label__2	This Tax Collector office might be the most convenient for me, but good grief am I over the employees at this location. I've encountered rude people working the front desk, employees who can't answer questions accurately, and one guy who didn't tell me my hair was totally fucked in my drivers license photo. The wait can be a headache, but that's the case with any of these offices, so it's worth trying to score an appointment online. They'll still run ten minutes behind with one, but it's better than being without.
__label__5	"this place is great - i found a stray pup last week and they've helped out with all sorts of dog supplies for my ill-equipped home.  they've got lots of suggestions for dog problems, like pumpkin mush for dog diarrhea.  yuk!

in other news, if anyone wants a sweet and playful pup who needs a lot of training, get in touch!"
__label__4	The wait staff and hostess were superb and the food was almost all great ! Would definitely  recommend charbroiled  ousters they were sublime.
__label__5	We always enjoy Tijuana Flats and tonight was no different.  Very good food and service as well.  But of particular note was, I watched a young lady come in, with a toddler and an infant (in a car seat carrier) and put in a take out order.  When it came to the pick up window, one of the managers (I am assuming) actually helped her to her car, carrying the take out order, In The Rain..  His name is Vito and he made an good impression on me
__label__5	This is our first time here and we are very impressed. The service was great, the Sardinas salad was delicious. All of our dinners were very flavorful but we topped it off with a warm lemon cake with warm lemon curd and we think we died and went to heaven.  This is definitely a hidden gem!
__label__3	"We used to get pizza from Allegro's all the time when I attended Penn in the mid '90's.  It is not a holy grail by any stretch of the imagination, but they make a decent, greasy pie and sell 6 packs of beer - which is essential during graduate school.

It also feels somewhat safe in there - the UC area has improved alot in recent years - but I was there when McDeath and the Wawa on Chestnut had ""hatchet man"" out front.

Anyhow - a good place to order a quick pie to go."
__label__5	I wanted to wait to write a review until my second visit bc I thought it was too god to be true! The service at both visits was phenomenal. Everyone who works there wants to you to be pleased with your nails. I am greeted by a smile and left feeling like my business was greatly appreciated. I got a regular gel manicure and a gel set - both are great! Attached are pictures of the gel set. It was $25 which is an extremely good price these days. I am so happy I found such a wonderful place. I 100% recommend coming here!
__label__3	"We were excited to try this place after reading good reviews.
The hot dog tasted processed and it was OK.
The burger was good.
The service was very bad. We were the only customers there, but they didn't even attempt to wipe the wet chairs after the rain for us."
__label__4	Big Fan here.  Great Pho and other spicy soups.  Clean and good service as well.
__label__1	"There is nothing like getting to Tampa at midnight with a confirmed reservation for a vehicle only to have the driver of the shuttle corral everyone to tell them ""sorry guys, don't shoot the messenger but there are zero cars"". So now, I'm having to take a $240 Uber ride to my destination. I just need to know who I'm sending my receipt to for reimbursement.

If I could give zero stars, that'd be preferable, but unfortunately not an option."
__label__2	Ordered a pepperoni slice. The person gave me a slice that had TWO AND A HALF pepperonis on it. Might as well haven gotten a cheese pizza slice! When I asked if he could change the slice, he said no. Mind you, no one else was in line behind me. Got to the cashier and asked him if he could get the other person to change my slice to one with more pepperonis. He completely ignored me. I found that to be VERYYYYY rude. Won't be back. I'd rather starve on Bourbon St. than give money to rude people.
__label__3	Great staff and the food is consistent but outside of the freshness and localness of the ingredients I have yet to be blown away.  That being said I'm always willing to return because they are,  as I said,  consistent.  Who doesn't love that?
__label__5	This restaurant reminds me of the Greek owned restaurants in my home town of Chicago.  The food and service are great.  We had one awful waitress but still worth the wait!
__label__1	UN F U * K I N G believable! $8.00 for a stupid Avocado roll? Are you kidding me? Who does this place think they are? Extremely WAY overpriced sushi for the 3rd most crime ridden city in the country!  Wtf, their sushi isn't that good and their rolls are small. Lower your prices you snobs!
__label__4	"You wait in line outside to be seated, which was surprisingly short compared to the line length. They're very efficient getting people in and out, but I never felt rushed!
They had a bunch of Cajun options! The serving size was medium but the taste was good! The sampler platter will fill you up off you're hungry. They didn't have too many local beers. Nothing on tap but a full bar besides that.
The atmosphere is loud, but I expected that. Overall good. I would go back."
__label__1	This is the worst sonic in town gave me raw bacon on my belt after wraith 1 hour they need to stop hiring stoners and hire someone that knows how to cook. Took a picture of my sandwich wish I could post it
__label__5	Came for the pool and loved it! We got there after 10am on a Saturday and it was already busy. We got a spot for nine of us in a bachelorette party and stayed in the pool for four hours :) Lots of groups came and went because there is not much room back there. Get there early! I wouldn't recommend the inside restaurant based on the attitude of the patrons and waiters. Not a huge food selection outside so consider bringing snacks.
__label__4	You have tons to choose from! Even the drink fountain was different. Their milkshake you can add alcohol to give it that kick. Tons of flavor tons of new things to try.  I will definitely be back to try more varieties!
__label__3	Food is OK. Prices are on the high side for the quality. Nice to see some BBQ competition finally. Something sorely missing 'round these parts. Ribs weren't very tasty without sauce. Chicken also not very tasty. But I did like the smokiness. Maybe use a little more seasoning (salt) for the meats. And also, restaurant should cut the chicken into manageable pieces, so it's easier to eat. Brown and chili weren't bad.
__label__3	I'll give 3 stars for food. But service is one star at best. After experiencing lousy service the past few times I decided to give it another shot.  Waited for our server forever. Food took extra long AGAIN   It's not a fine dining establishment. Don't know why they can't get it right. I'm going to take a hiatus from here for a while
__label__4	I had the chicken gyro platter with rice, salad, and pita bread. It was very good and seasoned just right. I paid about 8 bucks because I added on fries. It was so much food that I could not finish it. The place is clean and neat. I will def be going back in the future.
__label__1	This place is the worst, the collard greens are disgusting ..I literally had to wash them twice with the second time letting them soak, as they are saturated in some peppery sauce/seasoning. The fish was ok. My daughter ordered the shrimp pasta Alfredo and everything just had way too much seasoning. The wait time was ridiculous to wait so long and still be dissatisfied.
__label__4	Great food .. great service .. happy hour good too .. carnitas tacos really good...sangria delish
__label__5	"I am very proud to have this restaurant in our city. I believe it's of a high national standard if not world class. 
You get what you pay for.  Incredible, thanks to all involved."
__label__3	Pretty basic Cuban sandwich. Nothing ground breaking but not terrible either. They need to take some tips from cafe masaryktown
__label__5	This is by far my favorite fried chicken spot in Nashville. By far the best chicken sandwich I've ever had. Everyone who works there is very nice and relaxed. The malt chocolate alcohol beverage is definitely something you should try!
__label__4	My wife and I stopped for a quick lunch.  We were seated after a 10 minute wait.  We sat at the window, great for people watching.  Service and kitchen was quick.  Food was very good.  My wife had the shrimp and scallop salad.  I had blackened red snapper sandwich.  We would order same again.  I was looking for more fresh fish on the menu.  What they have is very good.
__label__4	"My husband and I went here for our anniversary.  The food and drinks were pretty typical American steakhouse.  The atmosphere was pleasant, I would definitely go again.  I'm providing only 4 stars, because it doesn't have that ""wow"" factor."
__label__3	"Sound: The sound is good here.
Seating: Seating is also good. 
Food/Drink: The beer selection is good but not a fan of the over priced food. 
Overall: I've been to some very good concerts here so it has a place in my heart. But the venue itself is only ok. Parking can be a pain."
__label__1	Talk about worst manicure ever. Worst service I've ever experienced. I would give them 0 Stars if I could.
__label__4	"We went for breakfast during the week, no wait, seated right away. The menu is huge with so much variety! I love how its western food we are familiar with (bacon and eggs) but also authentic Dutch options! You will want to get the ""hash"" dutch pancake, SO SO good. All breakfast around $15."
__label__1	This panera has the absolute WORST customer service of any place I've ever been to. Their staff is unacceptably rude and dismissive, they do NOT pay attention or care about their customers, not to mention everything we order here is wrong. Also, don't bother complaining to the 'manager' he's a worse employee than the ones he manages.
__label__4	So far everything has been wonderful for our son at caughlin preschool. We walk in the door and he gets excited to go play with his friends. The teachers are very nice and rave about how great he is and really seem to care. His first few days were very hard for me and they sent me text messages with photos to help ease my mind. After one week, my son is doing great and falling right into a good routine. I'll add another review after he's been there a few months but so far, so good!
__label__1	Cheap crappy clothes and they get involved in political issues on their fb page.  Since when should a Christian photographer be made to photograph a gay wedding?  #teamreligiousliberty
__label__5	Great swamp tour. Worth the money. You get to see gators, hogs, raccoons, birds, turtles, etc. So much fun. Our driver was Wade and he was a great guide. A must do when you come to New Orleans!
__label__1	Over priced marginal Mexican food.  Appetizer served at the same time as our meal. And loud. So loud that we spent the entire meal shouting at each other. Give it a pass if you'd like anything approaching a relaxing meal.
__label__5	Curry leaves is a fantastic restaurant. I got the butter chicken and it was amazing! Highly recommended. The decor is nice and feels very cozy. The waiter and waitresses are very attentive to us and was helpful when we were ordering and always topped our drinks. However, the parking and gas station that's connected to it is a bit strange. To go to the bathroom you have to use the gas station. I guess that makes it authentic...food is top notch and prices are affordable. If you're thinking about stopping by then you should do it. Hope you enjoy!
__label__4	They showed up on time and driver was very polite. Taking away one star due to vehicle smelling like cigarettes.
__label__5	You are very welcome and very deserving of all 5 stars. I was amazed by everything I tried, especially the chicken parm . Not a single complaint.  The service and food was above and beyond what I expected. Thank you for a great time and meal
__label__4	You must try the lemon poppyseed pancakes here... Delicious! Actually all the food is good. The portions are huge so come hungry. It gets busy and there is often a wait, but the staff and kitchen move at a good pace.
__label__5	The Cheshire Cat Inn was the perfect little getaway. It is close to state street and the beach, while still being private. The room was spacious and cozy. The staff and their hospitality was spot on! Doesn't get better than a bnb.
__label__5	I didn't think I would find anything walking in here... and once I was certain I didnt want anything... boom! It happened! There they were... super pretty and cute amber earrings  lucky meeee
__label__3	Their bagels are pretty good! Soft on the inside but firm on the outside. They have some pretty interesting flavors too! I don't eat cream cheese, but I could se how a cream cheese lover would go ham wild at this place considering the fact that they have soooooo many types! Go early if you want one of the more popular flavors. I'm a picky bagel eater because I've had some good ole genuine New York bagels in my life, but this place is decent for St. Pete.
__label__3	I'm sorry this took so long, but just after I posted my review the corporate office reached out to me, and sent me a check to replace my rear window. I am very grateful. Thank you!
__label__5	Had a great experience picking up our to go fish meals. The owner was outside greeting patrons thanking everyone for their support. Our meals were delicious.  Please support Bubbs Grub during this shutdown.
__label__1	"Someone should sue them for false advertising, these aren't French fries... I'm not sure what they are except a waste of time, money and calories - threw them in the trash...
Burger was not much better and they don't have mayo? Seriously? Epic fail!"
__label__5	Stopped in this morning for breakfast - our first time there. The sausage gravy is the best around and the service is fantastic. My over-easy eggs were perfectly cooked and came with home fries & meat. I chose bacon and was very surprised at the amount of bacon that came with it. The place has a family feel and is very reasonably priced. We will definitely be back!
__label__5	I feel like that this is not like any other gym. I come here a few times a week with my dad and get a little workout in, and I gotta say, I like it here. Good atmosphere, great staff, and other nicer gym patrons. I know this sounds weird, but it smells good too. If you're in the market for a new gym, I definitely recommend this one.
__label__1	Dr Smith's office ignored urgent phone calls for several months to obtain an appointment and refill of medications.  Medications were not refilled and ran out with no assistance.  Had to call PCP to fill medication and start from beginning with titrating medication.
__label__1	The food was not good and the service was very bad and we did not appreciate the waiter and we will never come back to this location ever again there where kids crying and random noise messing up are conversations we where there for 1 hour and 20 minutes 50 minutes we weren't eating so this location was very bad
__label__5	Just made my 4th visit to this restaurant and it was the very best experience !! I've always liked the food, but last night was exceptional on many levels. We loved our wait staff and how they took such good care of us. It was my parents anniversary and the staff really loved on them making them feel very special. They want to come again!!!! Food was superb! Thank you!!!
__label__5	I phoned going off of a few other reviews when in need of an arrangement delivered.  It's always very tricky not seeing what you are getting, but Judy did a great job at explaining and suggesting after telling her what I was looking for.  She even sent me a text picture of the arrangement before it was sent for delivery.  Thank you Flowers by Greenery!
